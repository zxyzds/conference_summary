    "title": "Trusted Multi-View Classification via Evolutionary Multi-View Fusion",
    "abstract": "Multi-view classification methodologies grounded in the Dempster-Shafer theory, renowned for their reliability in decision-making, have garnered significant application across various safety-critical domains due to their capacity to provide a degree of trustworthiness for each view. However, the adoption of a late fusion strategy by these methodologies constrains the interaction of information among views, thereby leading to suboptimal utilization of multi-view data. A recent advancement aimed at mitigating this limitation involves the generation of a pseudo view by concatenating all individual views. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of this pseudo view may be compromised when incorporating underperforming views, such as those afflicted by noise. Furthermore, the integration of a pseudo view exacerbates the issue of imbalanced multi-view learning, as it contains a disproportionate amount of information compared to individual views. To address these multifaceted challenges, we propose an approach termed Enhancing Trusted multi-view classification via Evolutionary multi-view Fusion (TEF). Specifically, we introduce an evolutionary multi-view architecture search method to generate a high-quality fusion architecture serving as the pseudo view, thus enabling adaptive selection of views and fusion operators. Subsequently, each view within the fusion architecture is enhanced by concatenating the decision output of the fusion architecture with its respective view. Our experimental findings underscore the efficacy of this straightforward yet potent strategy in mitigating the imbalanced multi-view learning problem, consequently enhancing TEF's performance, particularly on complex many-view datasets featuring more than three views compared to its counterparts. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on six multi-view datasets corroborate the superior performance of our proposed method over other trusted multi-view learning approaches.",

                "value": "This paper illustrates two main issues in existing trustworthy fusion methods: the lack of feature interaction in late fusion and the insufficient attention given to multi-view imbalance, which leads to inadequate training and suboptimal performance. To address this, the authors innovatively propose an evolutionary computation adaptive method that introduces high-quality pseudo-views, significantly enhancing the performance of trustworthy fusion methods on complex multi-view datasets. Furthermore, the authors present an effective solution for view imbalance and conduct extensive experiments to validate its effectiveness."

As long as the overall contributions of different views are balanced, focusing on the specific imbalance of the pseudo-view might be unnecessary. More evidence or justification would be helpful to show that this imbalance significantly impacts performance.\n\n2. The experimental comparisons may not ensure fairness, as it seems that the benchmarks used in this study do not align with those originally used in previous TMVC methods (e.g. ECML [1]). This raises concerns about consistency and fairness. Clarifying whether all models were evaluated under similar conditions would improve the reliability of the results.\n\n3. The claimed robustness of TEF in handling noisy or uncertain real-world data is not well-demonstrated. More experiments simulating practical conditions are needed to validate this aspect.\n\n[1] Reliable conflictive multi-view learning. AAAI 2024"

Can you provide more justification or empirical evidence showing that learning imbalance within pseudo-view-guided multi-view classification significantly impacts model performance?\n\n2. The benchmarks used in the paper seem different from those used in prior TMVC studies. Were the TMVC methods evaluated under the same conditions as your proposed TEF? Clarifying this would address concerns about fairness in experimental comparisons.\n\n3. Can you show additional experiments or real-world examples demonstrating TEF's effectiveness in handling noisy or uncertain data?\n\n4. Actually, the method seems to rely on aligning pseudo-view generation with target domain performance using validation labels. However, when samples are noisy, there appears to be no specific strategy to mitigate this noise. How does your approach show advancements over existing methods, especially given that Evidential Deep Learning has known limitations in fusion frameworks that could risk performance degradation?"
