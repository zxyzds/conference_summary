    "title": "The Computational Complexity of Positive Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs",
    "abstract": "We study the classical and parameterized complexity of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension of a set of concepts, that is, the smallest number of examples per concept required to successfully teach an intelligent learner under the considered, previously established model. For any class of concepts, it is known that this problem can be effortlessly transferred to the setting of balls in a graph $G$. We establish (1) the NP-hardness of the problem even when restricted to instances with positive non-clashing teaching dimension $k=2$ and where all balls in the graph are present, (2) near-tight running time upper and lower bounds for the problem on general graphs, (3) fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the vertex integrity of $G$, and (4) a lower bound excluding fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the feedback vertex number and pathwidth of $G$, even when combined with $k$.\nOur results provide a nearly complete understanding of the complexity landscape of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension and answer open questions from the literature.",

                "value": "The paper studies the complexity of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension that can be interpreted as the smallest number of examples needed to teach an intelligent learner. The paper models the concept class as the set of all balls of a certain radius k in a graph. (A ball of radius k consists of all vertices at a distance at most k from a vertex v serving as the center of the ball.)\n\nThe paper shows that the problem of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension is NP-complete, even when k=2. Previously, the problem was known to be NP-complete in general but not for a constant k.\n\nThe second result are improved upper and lower bounds on the time to solve the problem, as a function of the number of vertices n, diameter of the graph d and the radius of the balls k. Both previous and new bounds are exponential time but the exponents have been improved. For example, the upper bound is improved from 2^{O(n^2 d)} to 2^{O(n d k log n)}.\n\nThe third set of results is about the fixed parameter tractability of the problem. Previous, it was known that the problem is tractable if the vertex cover number of the graph is constant. This paper improves this to the vertex integrity being constant. It also considers several other possible improvements (replacing vertex integrity by smaller graph parameters) and rules them out."

Under the ETH this is also extended to upper and lower bounds on an optimal algorithm complexity for the problem. \nFor the non-strict variant they present new Fixed parameterized complexity results, with respect to less restrictive parameters (Vertex integrity vs vertex cover number used in previous analogous results for the strict variant).

                "value": "This paper studies and obtains several theoretical results for the non-clashing teaching dimension of a concept class. The positive, non-clashing teaching dimension of a class $\\cal C$, somewhat similar to VC dimension, is the minimum integer $k$ such that the following holds. For each concept in the class there is a unique set of examples associated with it of size up to $k$, so that for every two sets $S_1, S_2$ of examples (for different concepts $C_1, C_2$), the symmetric difference between $S_1$ and $S_2$ is non-zero.\n\nThis notion can equivalently be formulated using balls in graphs, where each concept corresponds to a ball of some radius around some vertex (note that some concepts can strictly contain others, e.g., a ball of radius 2 and a ball of radius 1 around the same vertex). The paper obtains several results about this graph theoretic concept:\n\n1. An NP-hardness result for a strict variant of the non-clashing dimension. It is shown that even determining whether the dimension is at most 2 is NP-hard, resolving a question of Chalopin et al. (COLT 2024).\n\n2. Tighter upper and lower bounds improving upon the aforementioned Chalopin et al. work. The upper and lower bound from the aforementioned work are $2^{O(n^2 d)}$ and $2^{\\Omega(n d)}$ where $d$ is the graph diameter, and the current work obtains upper and lower bound of $2^{O(ndk)}$ where $k$ is the non-clashing dimension.\n\n3. Parametrized results obtaining complexity that depend polynomially on $n$ and exponentially on parameters like the vertex integrity. There are also hardness results for well known parametrized notions such as path-width, and by extension, treewidth and cliquewidth.\n\nFrom the technical perspective, the proofs are rather intricate (especially the lower bound ones, which use careful reductions). I did not verify the full details but the proofs seem believable."
