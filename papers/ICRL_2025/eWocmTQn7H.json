    "title": "Multi-Resolution Decomposable Diffusion Model for Non-Stationary Time Series Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Recently, generative models have shown considerable promise in unsupervised time series anomaly detection. Nonetheless, the task of effectively capturing complex temporal patterns and minimizing false alarms becomes increasingly challenging when dealing with non-stationary time series, characterized by continuously fluctuating statistical attributes and joint distributions. To confront these challenges, we underscore the benefits of multi-resolution modeling, which improves the ability to distinguish between anomalies and non-stationary behaviors by leveraging correlations across various resolution scales. In response, we introduce a **M**ulti-Res**o**lution **De**composable Diffusion **M**odel (MODEM), which integrates a coarse-to-fine diffusion paradigm with a frequency-enhanced decomposable network to adeptly navigate the intricacies of non-stationarity. Technically, the coarse-to-fine diffusion model embeds cross-resolution correlations into the forward process to optimize diffusion transitions mathematically. It then innovatively employs low-resolution recovery to guide the reverse trajectories of high-resolution series in a coarse-to-fine manner, enhancing the model's ability to learn and elucidate underlying temporal patterns. Furthermore, the frequency-enhanced decomposable network operates in the frequency domain to extract globally shared time-invariant information and time-variant temporal dynamics for accurate series reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted across five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MODEM achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be generalized to other time series tasks. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

I understand the difficulties stated by the authors in properly tuning the large number of hyperparameters; however without an objective method for setting parameters based on training data alone it is not clear whether the selected parameter settings will generalise well to other datasets. Here, the authors should at least provide some analysis of how sensitive the results are to variations of individual parameter values by keeping the rest of the parameters at their suggested values. \n- The resolution parameter R is set to a rather low value of 4 in the experiments and hence covers only a narrow range of resolutions which seems contrary to the overall claim of the authors that the method leverages correlations across various resolution scales. \n- The method seems to be mainly improving on the recall value while trailing behind interns of precision, sometimes significantly, compared to other methods. I believe further clarification of this tradeoff in practical scenarios is needed.  \n- The authors should provide more details on the pooling operation in the MRD sampler.\n- No code is provided which makes proper assesment of the experimental results and method difficult."

The content of Section 3.3 with theoretical  derivation is very similar to CONTEXTDIFF [1], where the difference is just *coarse-resolution sequence $\\leftarrow$ text (condition)* and *high-resolution sequence $\\leftarrow$ image (target)*. However, the authors did not clearly tell this point in their paper where the proper citation is not given. In particular, the entire paper cites [1] in `Section 3.3 Multi-Resolution Forward Process` for only once (in an inconspicuous place), and [1] is completely omitted in the theoretical results in Appendix A. I understand that these sections make the paper more solid, but I suggest the authors emphasize contributions of the prior work when necessary. \n3. Although important works in the field of anomaly detection are analyzed in Section 2, there are some other diffusion-based approaches that should be included, such as related conditional diffusion model [1], diffusion model for time series [5,6] and so on.\n\n**References:**\n> [1] Yang, Ling, et al. \"Cross-modal contextualized diffusion models for text-guided visual generation and editing.\"  \n[2] Woo, Gerald, et al. \"Etsformer: Exponential smoothing transformers for time-series forecasting.\"  \n[3] Luo, Donghao, and Xue Wang. \"Moderntcn: A modern pure convolution structure for general time series analysis.\"  \n[4] Wang, Chengsen, et al. \"Drift doesn't matter: dynamic decomposition with diffusion reconstruction for unstable multivariate time series anomaly detection.\"  \n[5] Fan, Xinyao, et al. \"MG-TSD: Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion Models with Guided Learning Process.\"  \n[6] Shen, Lifeng, et al. \"Multi-Resolution Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting.\""
