    "title": "Hi-TPH: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for TCR-pHLA Binding Prediction",
    "abstract": "The interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide-human leukocyte antigen complex (pHLA) is a fundamental process underlying T cell-mediated immunity. Computational methods have been developed to predict TCR-pHLA binding, but most existing models were trained on relatively small datasets and focused solely on the Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR $\\beta$ chain. A key barrier to developing advanced prediction models is the limited availability of comprehensive data containing understudied prediction components. In this light, we developed the Hi-TPH dataset with more protein sequences and gene annotations. The dataset is stratified into five hierarchical subsets at four different levels, ranging from Hi-TPH level I with only the peptide sequence and TCR CDR3 $\\beta$ to Hi-TPH level II, III, and IV that incorporate increasing levels of HLA sequences, full TCR $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ chains, and gene annotations. Hi-TPH at any level represents the largest dataset with corresponding prediction components to date, for instance, the Hi-TPH level IV dataset is at least 5.99 times the size of existing ones regarding the number of TCR-pHLA pairs. We further report benchmark results on the Hi-TPH dataset, establishing valuable baselines for the TCR-pHLA binding prediction task. This comprehensive dataset and associated benchmarks provide a valuable resource for developing advanced TCR-pHLA binding prediction models and exploring research directions such as understanding the contribution of different components and enhancing model generalization to unseen peptides, with potential applications in developing targeted therapies, including personalized vaccines and immunotherapies.",

                "value": "Recognition of virus or pathogen derived peptides by the immune system is important and can e.g. provide diagnostic tools or tools to design tailored treatments. The T cell centered immunity does that recognition using T cell receptors (TCR) that can recognise peptides that are presented on the surface of e.g. dendritic cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The TCR, peptide and MHC are highly variable which makes it difficult to understand and predict these interactions. There is only little structural data available from this triplet, but fortunately experimental data has been collected that characterise these interactions either as binary response variable or continuous binding affinity measurement (not available in large quantities and not included in this work). The field has two main databases that has collected this information, VDJdb and IEDB, as well as a few other smaller datasets. This manuscript contributes by making this dataset more easily accessible for machine learning researchers who may not be familiar with immunology or otherwise may feel difficult to access the data from the database directly.  \n\nThe TCR, peptide ,MHC interaction prediction has attracted lots of attention recently in the bioinformatics/ML community. In terms of originality and significance, the impact of this work is weak though because essentially all previous methods have used exactly the same databases. Depending on the pre-processing filters used by earlier studies, or depending on how much data has been in these databases at the time of publizing the earlier studies, determines \u201chow big datasets\u201d the previous studies have used. Claiming large improvements in terms of dataset sizes are therefore subjective, and anyways some recent papers that used almost as many data points as this manuscript are not cited here. \n\nThe quality and clarity of data collection looks good."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The number of papers published on this topic has increased during the recent years.  Authors try to be extensive in describing some of them but also ignore several recent contributions.  Authors note for example (line 70), that majority of previous works have focused on using only the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3). There are several earlier works, some of which are also cited in this manuscript, that try to utilize all parts of the TCR alpha and beta chains, such as ERGO-II (cited here), Titan, TCRGP, epi-TRACE, DEEPTCR, and perhaps some others. \n\nManuscript is a bit unclear of whether it is primarily the CRD3 that is the key determinant of the interaction, or do other TCR parts also contribute to the interactions. Glanville et al. (cited here) carried out a structural analysis of contacts between amino acids between different parts of the TCR, peptide MHC, using crystal structures, suggesting that also parts beyond CDR3 are important, and earlier studies have observed similar in terms of features important in their ML methods (e.g. ERGO-II and epi-TRACE, perhaps others that I do not remember now). \n\nAs mentioned above, the number of TCR, peptide-MHC pairs analysed in previous studies has been affected by pre-processing steps that the authors have decided to use, as well as the number of data points in the VDJdb and IEDB databases at the time of earlier studies. Claiming significant increase in the number of data points is somehow subjective, because essentially all previous papers have been using the exact same datasets. If one downloads the VDJdb and IEDB datasets, one immediately gets about 200k data points (this is an estimate, I didn\u2019t do check the numbers now), or about 20k datapoints that would be in level 4 (using the terminology of this manuscript), which are comparable numbers reported here. Previous papers that have released their code have also made data processing scripts available, so earlier scripts makes such datasets also automatically available. I understand that this manuscript tries to make data even more easliy accessible to ML community, but I am not sure the contribution of this manuscript is significant enough to be a separate publication, as many earlier works have done exactly the same task. \n\nOne challenge in this ML prediction problem is that the experimental dataset contains only positive data points and negatives are typically artificially generated. Authors propose here to use so-called on-the-fly mispairing for that purpose. In practise, that means doing the mispairing randomly e.g. for each training epoch. Some of the previous methods may do that as well, e.g. if I remember correctly ImReg tool only takes the positive data points as an input. Whether it resamples the negative for each epoch, I would need to check from the code. \n\nSome of the earlier methods, can also utilize partial information about TCRs (i.e., when the full length protein is not available for each data point), e.g. a recent method called TULIP. \n\nLong-tail distribution of binding TCRs for different peptides is a known challenge in these datasets, but authors do not provide any solutions. \n\nAuthors conclude that HLA information (that encodes MHC genes) may not provide additional predictive capabilities. This may be too strong of statement, and perhaps rather reflect limitations of the current datasets, where peptide is typically measured only in a single HLA context, resulting in little variability for ML models to learn from. \n\nResults. Authors provide baseline comparison results for the prediction task using different ML methods, including random forest, MLP, and language-based methods. It seems that apart from TAPE-BERT, none of the baseline methods used exactly correspond to any of the published methods. The comparisons would make more sense and would be more valuable it they were carried using published methods that are all tailored for this task."

The reader might therefore expect a similar number of samples in the datasets used in these papers as in Hi-TPH. I suspect it may have to do with the inclusion of murine data in Hi-TPH, but the paper could be improved by including a thorough discussion of this discrepancy. The introduction of this dataset would be more impactful if the authors could show that including this additional data improves performance at the binding prediction task.\n\nThe dataset is \"randomly\" split into training, validation, and test sets, but it is not clear the steps taken to prevent data leakage: can the same CDR3$\\beta$/peptide/etc. occur in the same splits? This is a non-trivial task for the datasets lower in the hierarchy, and could do with more discussion. Leakage of sequences lower down in the hierarchy that cannot exist higher up the hierarchy may impact the benchmarking results. Moreover, there is a discussion of unseen peptides in the test set, but it is unclear how these unseen peptides are chosen: are they just from peptides which have by chance not appeared in the training dataset? If so, they are more likely to belong to the long tail described in Section 3.2, which could introduce a bias, and the unseen benchmark might improve by selecting the peptides in a more appropriate way.\n\nAlthough the \"on-the-fly mispairing\" is used in training, it is not clear how the negatives in the test set are constructed - is the test set deterministic?\n\nThis paper lists several models in Table 1, but these are not included in the benchmark."
