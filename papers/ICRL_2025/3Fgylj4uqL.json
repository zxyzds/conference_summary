    "title": "Interpretable Causal Representation Learning for Biological Data in the Pathway Space",
    "abstract": "Predicting the impact of genomic and drug perturbations in cellular function is crucial for understanding gene functions and drug effects, ultimately leading to improved therapies. To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, in this work we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-$\\delta$, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful.",

                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of learning interpretable causal representations for Perturb-seq data (gene expression in cells). The primary contribution is the novel introduction of masking to incorporate biological process (BP) knowledge into an existing method for causal representation learning (discrepency-VAE), which is named SENA-discrepancy-VAE. The masking ensures that latent factors can be interpreted as linear combinations of the activity of BPs. Since this modification is compatible with the discrepancy-VAE, the original model's theoretical guarantees for causal representation learning remain.\n\nThe method and ablated variants are evaluated on a Perturb-seq dataset collected from one particular cell line and is set up to minimize the overlap between the BPs. The results demonstrate that SENA performs similarly to discrepency-VAE in terms of reconstruction yet results in sparser and more interpretable results. Furthermore, by studying the contrast between inferred activity levels on perturbed and control samples the authors show that the latent factors can be associated with BPs and are therefore interpretable."

The main idea presented in this work is to design a more flexible encoder class (SENA-\\delta) specific to mapping biological pathways to latent causal factors for interpretability.

A key innovation of this work is how it integrates biological processes (BPs) as prior knowledge, directly linking the model\u2019s latent factors to known biological pathways. This approach fills an important gap in existing CRL methods, which often struggle with interpretability since they don't directly associate learned representations with actual biological mechanisms, making them less useful for real research applications.\n\nSENA-discrepancy-VAE builds on the standard discrepancy-VAE by introducing a pathway-based masking strategy within a new encoder, SENA-\u03b4. This encoder uses a two-layer masked MLP where the first layer maps gene expression values to BP activity levels, with a tunable parameter that adjusts the influence of genes outside predefined pathways, giving the model flexibility in gene-pathway associations. The second layer models latent factors as combinations of these BP activities, which is a more realistic approach since biological interventions often impact multiple pathways. This setup stays true to the CRL assumption that each intervention targets a single latent factor but does so in a way that aligns with biological realities.\n\nThe authors evaluate SENA-discrepancy-VAE on a Perturb-seq dataset of leukemia lymphoblast cells. They show that the model performs as well as the original discrepancy-VAE on unseen perturbation combinations while providing greater interpretability by identifying specific BPs associated with each latent factor. This interpretability is validated through pathway-specific analysis, demonstrating the model\u2019s ability to reveal biologically meaningful patterns in response to genetic interventions."

Through the direct alignment of the latent factors with biological pathways, SENA-discrepancy-VAE addresses the common limitation in CRL models of producing uninterpretable latent factors. \n\n2) The paper presents thorough experiments across multiple perturbation types, including single and double-gene knockouts, demonstrating the model\u2019s robustness. Its generalization to unseen perturbations is compelling, and the ablation studies, which explore interpretability-reconstruction trade-offs, further validate the model\u2019s design.\n\n3) The authors have done a good job communicating the importance of embedding biological processes into latent spaces, with visuals that illustrate BP-specific activity levels influencing latent factors.

In biological experiments, the cellular response often evolves in phases, with gene activity showing distinct transitions that are essential for understanding the effect of interventions.\n\n2) The model\u2019s validation on a single dataset (K562 cell line data) restricts insights into its generalizability across different cell types or conditions. Testing on additional datasets, such as those from other cell lines or cellular environments, would offer a stronger assessment of robustness and applicability across a wider range of biological data.\n\n3) The model assumes static pathway relevance across all tasks, which may limit its adaptability in varied biological contexts where pathway importance changes with cell type or condition.\n\n4) The paper assumes that each intervention corresponds to a single latent factor, limiting the model's ability to capture complex interactions where multiple latent factors might be influenced by a single intervention. This simplification restricts the model\u2019s interpretability in representing overlapping or interacting biological processes, which are common in gene expression dynamics.\n\n5) The model lacks a detailed exploration of how varying the number of latent dimensions impacts the interpretability and causal mapping of latent factors.

Pathway importance often varies, and adapting pathway relevance could improve model flexibility.  A task-specific analysis to explore whether dynamically adjusting pathway selection enhances generalizability across datasets and biological contexts could provide insights into the model\u2019s robustness.\n\n3) In the causal graph (Figure 3), how sensitive are the edge weights to the choice of \u03bb and latent dimension?

Training curves would help understand if this is an optimization or regularization effect. Does this phenomenon persist if you randomize the pathway annotations while maintaining the same sparsity structure? This would determine if the benefit comes from biological knowledge or just sparsity.\n\n6) Have the authors empirically validated that the expectation in Equation (10) aligns with the observed experimental outcomes?
