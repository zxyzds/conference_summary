    "title": "Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Informed Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems",
    "abstract": "Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-informed approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-informed approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges.",

The physics branch implements a modified diffusion-advection equation with a correction term for open systems (BA-DAE).

Given that real air pollution sources (industrial activity, vehicle emissions) and sinks (forests, lakes) exhibit complex non-linear relationships, why did you simplify the correction term $\\beta X$ as a linear term? What is the physical justification for setting $\\beta$'s range to $[\u22121, +\u221e)$?\n\nQ2. While you claim that the Physics branch explicitly models physical phenomena, how is this physical interpretability preserved when projecting into latent space?\n\nQ3. Regarding the temporal alignment process using Decay-TCL, how do the chosen values of $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 =0.8$ guarantee physically meaningful alignment? What is the physical significance of using time-decaying weights?\n\nQ4. Why specifically choose Spatial-MSA in the Data-Driven branch? How does this align with a physics-informed approach?\n\nQ5. The authors justify GNN fusion based on 'distance-dependent influence', but isn't this characteristic already considered in the Physics branch?\n\nQ6. How can the authors justify the performance on the national-scale KnowAir dataset when case studies are limited to the Beijing dataset?\n\nQ7. How does the visualization of $\\beta$ values correspond to actual observed pollution source/sink data?\"\n\nQ8. Can authors perform sensitivity analysis for different ranges of $\\beta$ values?\n\nQ9. The authors seem to only consider the DOPRI5 ODE solver. Could they analyze performance and runtime differences when using simpler methods like Euler or RK4?\n\nQ10. The paper should reference and compare with recent work on climate modeling using diffusion and diffusion-advection equations in neural ODE frameworks [1,2]. Can authors clarify their position by analyzing similarities and differences in their approach to diffusion and advection?\n\nQ11. How does the intentional violation of conservation law in BA-DAE affect numerical stability, particularly for ODE solvers?\n\nQ12. How do you ensure that the BA-DAE in the Physics branch and Neural ODE in the Data-driven branch operate in the same state space?\n\nQ14. Is 'Physics-Informed' appropriate in the title? Would 'Physics-guided' or 'Physics-inspired' be more accurate, given that this might be confused with traditional PINN approaches?\n\nQ15. Can authors provide more details about the RNN used in the Coefficient Estimator?\n\nQ16. Figure 2 lacks several elements mentioned in the text, particularly \u03b1 from equation 6. The relationship between Dynamics fusion and Section 3.4 equations needs clarification.\n\nQ17. Can authors provide visualizations or distribution analyses showing how Gdiff and Gadv change dynamically with wind speed and direction?\n\nQ18. While criticizing the computational cost of existing physics-based methods, how does your dual branch architecture with a complex fusion mechanism improve efficiency? Doesn't using two ODE solvers increase computational burden?\n\nQ19. Can the authors include the number of forward evaluations (NFE) comparisons in Table 2's ablation studies?\n\nQ20. The authors should cover related work on GNNs that redesign the diffusion equation [3,4] and its variations[5,6] using NODE. Can you discuss more about what the authors' methods have in common and what they differ from?\n\n> [1] Choi, Hwangyong, et al. \"Climate modeling with neural advection-diffusion equation.\" Knowledge and Information Systems 65.6 (2023): 2403-2427.\n> \n> [2] Hwang, Jeehyun, et al. \"Climate modeling with neural diffusion equations.\" 2021 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM).
