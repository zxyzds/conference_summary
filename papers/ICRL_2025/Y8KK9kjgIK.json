    "title": "SigDiffusions: Score-Based Diffusion Models for Time Series via Log-Signature Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have recently emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for a variety of data modalities. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to adapt these models to generate long multivariate time series. Viewing a time series as the discretization of an underlying continuous process, we introduce SigDiffusion, a novel diffusion model operating on log-signature embeddings of the data. The forward and backward processes gradually perturb and denoise log-signatures preserving their algebraic structure. To recover a signal from its log-signature, we provide new closed-form inversion formulae expressing the coefficients obtained by expanding the signal in a given basis (e.g. Fourier or orthogonal polynomials) as explicit polynomial functions of the log-signature. Finally, we show that combining \\texttt{SigDiffusion} with these inversion formulae results in highly realistic time series generation, competitive with the current state-of-the-art on various datasets of synthetic and real-world examples.",

The diffusion processes generates samples from a distribution in a (latent truncated) log-signature space (coming from Rough Path theory), which serves as an efficient embedding of a time series. The authors discuss improved methods for recover from the log-signature to time-series path space \u2014 namely they propose some new closed-form inversion formulas to recover the time-series trajectories from the log-signature as polynomial series. \n\nThe two main contributions are:\n1. Application of score-based generative diffusion model to space of truncated log-signatures, which is \n2. Improvements to signature inversion algorithm going from the log-signature space to trajectory space. \n    1. This is done by path as expressed as a series in different polynomial bases, which can be shown to converge.\n\nThese two claims are backed up by empirical experiments:\n- For the signature inversion: synthetic evaluation using example paths random sine waves + gaussian noise,\n- For the diffusion model application time-series: Two synthetic data (sines, Lotka\u2013Volterra system) and three real data: Household Electric Power Consumption, Exchange Rates, and Weather."

                "value": "### Contribution, Theory, and Experiments:\n\n- Doing the diffusion in log-signature (or the space of any integral transform/transformed feature or embedding) is a relatively straightforward idea (similar ideas are discussed in related literature of section 4). Primary contribution seems to me to the closed form signature inversion formula, which then enables one to do the diffusion processes in the log-signature space. I am more or less convinced that the presented polynomial series would approximate the original signal. But all numerical illustrations done in this aspect are only with synthetic data, and not using real data (though the synthetic illustrations are quite extensive, they seem to mostly cover of the case of a low frequency signal + noise).\n    - Since the signature inversion is a primary claim, it may be useful to provide some illustrations using the real datasets about reconstruction quality (e.g., in terms of $\\ell_2$ error akin to Fig 8.) from log signature (e.g., number of basis, type of basis, properties of the data analogous to Appendix D.)\n    - The runtime to recover using the closed form inversion formula in terms of number of basis and number of truncated signatures is not explicitly stated.\n- It may be useful to have at least a comparison to one non-diffusion baed generative time series model (i.e., pick one from section 4, following from TimeGAN paper).\n\n### Organization and Writing:\n\n- Disclaimer: I not an expert in signature method or rough path theory:\n    - Not coming from this background, I think presentation in full generality of Section 2 is, in my opinion, not very accessible.\n    - The present development may be more suitable for an appendix. The exposition in provided references (e.g., Fermanian et al. 2023) was more clear to me.\n\n### Errata: \n- Line 213: acronym ST is not defined, assume it refers to (log)-Signature Transform."

                "value": "- Could authors provide some results on signal recovery for real signals? (e.g. some signals have non-noise high frequency characteristics that may not be well captured without higher order terms of polynomial series, you could back this with up with some synthetic signals as well).\n- In Appendix E of experimental details could authors provide some discussion about which inversion scheme (and how many basis authors used) authors chose for the real data and why?\n- Why is the order of the log-signature order chosen to be 4 in your experiment? Since the runtime growth is highly unfavorable in the order $\\mathcal{O}[(d^{n+1}-1)/(d-1)]$ and mildly unfavorable in the dimension of the signal.\n- On the runtime aspect, to make work self contained, could authors provide some discussion (extending Figure 1) about how much runtime is required to transform between the truncated log-signature space (extending discussion in lines 198-205), and go from the log-signature space to the path space using Theorems in 3.1 and 3.2 (i.e., extending Table 2) and comment on runtime as compared to previous method (e.g., Inversion method).\n- Connection to long sequences specifically is unclear to me, could you elaborate on why SigDiffusion is more suitable for long sequences?\n\nHappy to adjust my score if these concerns are addressed"

It is not clear what the experiment proves in relation to the paper's claim. It is unclear whether it is showing that it is excellent as a generative model for time series, or whether it is showing that it is excellent in score-based diffusion, but since it is being compared with TS-Diffusion, I think it is showing that it is excellent in the overall generative model for multiple series. Since time series generation models are being actively developed, it is necessary to compare the most advanced methods, and it should be explained that appropriate methods have been selected for comparison. There are so many different new methods, and the evaluation metrics and data sets are all different, that it is impossible to judge whether they are producing sufficient results.\nAlso, the Discriminative Score is generally a better indicator when the value is larger, and this can be recognized even by reading the explanation, but it seems that a smaller value is better. I think it would be better to clarify the definition. It seems that the predictive score is defined in the same way as the loss used in training, but the loss in training does not always match the loss in prediction performance, so the definition should be clearly stated."

However, I am familiar with Lie algebra, group theory, and some algebraic and topological algebra. I find this paper challenging to read and understand, even with my background. The paper feels more like a math paper than an ML paper, especially in the first half. While I appreciate the mathematics, I believe there are valuable insights here, but I suggest the authors polish the presentation to better engage the general ML community.\n\n* Are Thm 2.1 and Thm 2.2 original results? If not, consider treating them as lemmas and specifying the reference in the title. For example, \"Lemma 2.1 (Shuffle Identity, Ree 1958).\"\n\n* Poor motivation. For theory-heavy papers, motivation and intuition are important to communicate with a broader audience, including non-theorists and mathematicians. For example, in Appendix A, while the authors provide some examples, they remain very dry and don't help the reader appreciate the connection between log-signature and ML.\n\n* As a background section, Sec. 2 is very dry and difficult to learn from, beyond memorizing definitions.\n\n* As a methodology paper, the experiments are somewhat limited.\n  -  Ablation. The paper does not include enough ablation studies. Additional ablation studies are needed to support the findings.\n  - For common time series data, why only use exchange rates and weather? Why not include electricity and traffic data?\n\nGiven above, I find this paper not ready for publication. I encourage the authors to improve its accessibility for the broader ML community."

Especially it's well-known time series is one of the most noisy data type.\n\n* In `line 182`, why you describe the score function as it's not continuous? In score-based DMs, while the time is discretized for implementation purposes,  score function is continuous.\n\nFrom above, I find it difficult to see the connection between DMs and log-signature embedding in Sec. 2.3."
