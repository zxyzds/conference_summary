    "abstract": "Can variational auto-encoders (VAEs) generate flexible continuous latent space for long electrocardiogram (ECG) segments and reconstruct the input? A folded VAE architecture is introduced in this study which is able to encode long ECG segments by splitting an input segment into folds and process them in sequence using a narrow field-of-view in the encoder and concatenate them at the end, instead of processing the long segment at a time. The VAE decoder follows similar folding and concatenation strategy for reconstruction of the original ECG segments. The proposed folded VAE architecture is able to generate better reconstruction of long 30-second ECG segments compared to unfolded classical VAE approach which often produce trivial reconstruction of long ECG segments. Experimental results show that the latent representation generated by our folded VAE architecture not only retains rich compressed information but also aids designing interpretable models by providing decision-making insights.",

For instance, it is not clear what the summation means in equations (1-2) \u2014 does it really mean summation by averaging over the representation obtained from different folds? If yes, why? Similarly, it was not well justified why we can merge 30 8x4 features into 8x120 future map.\n\n3. The relation between the VAE described in 2.4 and the specific model described in 2.8 is not clear.\n\n4.
