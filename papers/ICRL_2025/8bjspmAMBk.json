    "title": "Quality Measures for Dynamic Graph Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models have recently achieved significant success in modeling graph data, including dynamic graphs, where topology and features evolve over time. However, unlike in vision and language domains, evaluating generative models for dynamic graphs is challenging due to the difficulty of visualizing their output, making quantitative metrics essential. In this work, we develop a new quality metric specifically for evaluating generative models of dynamic graphs. Current metrics for dynamic graphs typically involve discretizing the continuous-evolution of graphs into static snapshots and then applying conventional graph similarity measures. This approach has several limitations: (a) it models temporally related events as i.i.d. samples, failing to capture the non-uniform evolution of dynamic graphs; (b) it lacks a unified measure that is sensitive to both features and topology; (c) it fails to provide a scalar metric, requiring multiple metrics without clear superiority; and (d) it requires explicitly instantiating each static snapshot, leading to impractical runtime demands that hinder evaluation at scale. We propose a novel metric based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, applying random projections directly to dynamic graph data. This results in an expressive, scalar, and application-agnostic measure of dynamic graph similarity that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods. We also provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of metrics for continuous-time dynamic graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.",

The authors propose a new metric based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which leverages random projections to create an expressive, scalar measure that captures the complex dependencies in dynamic graphs, overcoming limitations in current evaluation methods.\n\nCurrent metrics for evaluating dynamic graph generative models (DGGMs) rely on static snapshots, and therefore lose the temporal dependencies. Moreover, current metrics fail to capture node and edge features and their relation to the graph topology. They are also only sensible to specific properties resulting to the need of multiple metrics. Many of these metrics are also computationaly inefficient. \n\nTo address these limitations, the authors propose a new Johnson-Lindenstrauss-based (JL) metric, inspired by work in the static graph domain and image-based evaluations. The metric applies random projections directly to continuous-time dynamic graph data, effectively embedding the variable-length sequence of graph events into a fixed-dimensional vector space. This transformation preserves the similarity of data across temporal interactions and node features while avoiding the computational cost of explicit snapshot instantiation.\n\nThe author justify the use of random projections on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which asserts that random orthogonal projections can approximately preserve the distance between data points. This property allows the proposed metric to map dynamic graph events of varying lengths into a unique dimension. \n\nExperiments are conducted on both real-world datasets (e.g., Reddit, Wikipedia, LastFM) and synthetic datasets. They show that the JL metric provides consistent, high-fidelity measurements across topological and temporal changes, with reduced computational overhead."

The authors themselves acknowledge this by stating that they \"follow recent analogous work in the static graph domain by Thompson et al., 2022.\" The contribution is therefore limited.\n\nThe applicability of the proposed metric is focused on continuous-time dynamic graph generative models (CTDGs) with a given initial graph. It is a relatively small field within dynamic graph research, where most studies adopt a supervised learning setting. Moreover, new metrics for CTDGs can be integrated within papers introducing novel generative models, as it have been the case for instance in Zhang et al. (2021). The potential impact of this work may be limited.\n\nThe paper does not include a discussion of the limitations of the method. For instance, it does not address the fact that the metric evaluates only the changes in the graph over time rather than the graph structure itself, limiting the possible application of the metric. Scalability could be an issue, for example, when applying the method to large graphs. These are just examples and a paragraph on some limitations of the method would be insight full. \n\nThe paper does not provide practical recommendations for applying the metric to common datasets. Specifically, there is no guidance on selecting the optimal number of samples, events, or the dimensions of descriptors, which could help in effectively using the metric on various datasets.\n\nMinor comment:\nI think that there is a small typo in the formula at the end of line 119."
