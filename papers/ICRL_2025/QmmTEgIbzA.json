    "abstract": "The recent cohort of publicly available generative models can produce human expert level content across a variety of topics and domains. Given a model in this cohort as a base model, methods such as parameter efficient fine-tuning, in-context learning, and constrained decoding have further increased generative capabilities and improved both computational and data efficiency. Entire collections of derivative models have emerged as a byproduct of these methods and each of these models has a set of associated covariates such as a score on a benchmark, an indicator for if the model has (or had) access to sensitive information, etc. that may or may not be available to the user. For some model-level covariates, it is possible to use \u201csimilar\u201d models to predict an unknown covariate. In this paper we extend recent results related to embedding-based representations of generative models \u2013 the data kernel perspective space \u2013 to classical statistical inference settings. We demonstrate that using the perspective space as the basis of a notion of \u201csimilar\u201d is effective for multiple model-level inference tasks.",

                "value": "This is the continuation of our response to nufo's review.\n\n> There is limited discussion ...\n\nGreat question! As mentioned above, along with the number of queries (m) and the number of models (n), there are numerous other hyperparameters to consider when generating the DKPS, such as how to aggregate responses, how to aggregate over queries, and the metric on the aggregations over queries. It is also important to consider the embedding function (g), the distribution of queries (G), and the number of replicates per query (r). \n\nWe have found that the two most impactful hyperparameters are the embedding function (g) and the distribution of queries (G). The impact of these are relatively intuitive. For example, if the embedding function that you use is not capable of capturing the inherent difference between the models, then the DKPS representations will not be reasonably separated. Similarly, if the queries that you are using to prompt the model do not allow for the models to express their differences, then the DKPS representations will not be reasonably separated.\n\nWe explored the effect of different distribution of queries in our sensitive-data classification experiment and showed that queries that are relevant to the difference in model classes can significantly reduce the number of required queries to achieve a particular performance. We did not explore the effect of different embedding functions in this paper since its effects on more common problems (such as classification, clustering, etc.) documents is well-known.\n\nThere is a lot to explore with respect to this method -- which we discuss in the Discussion -- and we are excited to continue to push it forward.\n\n> In the paper, you mention ...\n\nGreat question! The representations of the models in DKPS can be used to perform any inference task on the models themselves. In this sense, DKPS can be used to predict any type (real valued, categorical, etc.) of covariate. How well-suited the representations are for a particular task will depend on the hyperparameters discussed above.\n\nWe discuss this in the paragraph that starts on line 200/201 (\u201cWhile we do not ..\u201d). In summary, if the covariate can be described as a function of the average of the model responses then the current DKPS pipeline can be used for optimal performance. If, instead, the covariate is a more complicated function of model responses then a variation of the proposed method should be used. \n\nWe tried to address model safety in the model toxicity & bias experiment -- please let us know how we could better address \u201csafety\u201d!\n\n> How does your method ...\n\nGreat question -- since the foundation of the DKPS is a collection of embeddings associated with each model, our method would be affected by response complexity for a given set of queries, not necessarily \u201cmodel\u201d complexity. With that said, the proportion of models with a particular level of response complexity is bounded below by some \\epsilon > 0 as the number of models grows, then the performance will not be meaningfully affected.\n\nPlease let us know if there are anything else we can clarify or any other questions you may have throughout this discussion phase."

                "value": "nufo,\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and review our paper. We have addressed your part of your review below. \n\n$ \\textbf{Summary}$ :\n\nWe think your summary is a fair description of our work.\n\n$ \\textbf{Strengths}$:\n\nWe agree with your noted strengths of the paper. \n\n$ \\textbf{Weaknesses}$:\n> The paper claims ...\n> The experiments are narrow ...\n\nWe agree that our work is an extension of existing embedding-based analysis. We disagree that it is only a modest extension. To go from analyzing the embeddings of a collection of documents to analyzing the embeddings of generative models requires 1) an aggregation over responses, 2) an aggregation over queries, and 3) a suitable metric on the aggregation over queries. There are a number of options for each of these three steps -- which opens the door for theoretical and empirical explorations of numerous instances of similar methods -- that suggests, to us, that the extension is not trivial.\n\nOur goal with the experiments was to demonstrate the general application of the proposed method. For example, we consider one classification task and three regression tasks and consider three different collections of models across the four tasks -- one collection parameterized by different fixed augmentations, one collection parameterized by different LoRA matrices, and one collection of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d but related models. On one hand, this demonstrates broad applicability. On the other hand, our analysis was limited to 7B models and quantized versions of 7B models due to very real computational and budget constraints. While we expect our results to hold for collections of larger models, we agree that including such an example would improve our paper.\n\n$ \\textbf{Questions} $:\n> How does your approach scale ...\n\nOur method is quite general and can be applied to larger models or model collections. With that said, one of the components of our method is querying each model multiple times. We expect that this is unavoidable in the black-box setting that we address -- though we are actively working on ways to get high-quality representations of the models in as few queries as possible. Some promising directions that we are working on include selecting a core-set of queries, developing an \u201coptimal\u201d metric on the aggregation of queries, and ensembling across embedding functions.\n\n> The tasks chosen ...\n\nOutside the context of benchmarking, statistical analysis of populations of models is relatively new. As such, there are relatively few standard tasks. We took this as an opportunity to explore what we thought were interesting and relevant tasks. \n\nGiven that the treatment of our setting as a classical supervised learning problem is relatively new, the choice of using the \u201cWas RA Fisher great?\u201d as our leading example was mainly due to its simplicity. The covariate y = P[\u201cyes\u201d | augmentation] is easy to understand. Further, the model-level covariate surface should correlate strongly along the dimension in the perspective space that captures difference in the eugenics and statistics augmentations.\n\nWe disagree that \u201cdetecting [if a model has / had access to] sensitive information\u201d task is narrow and not reflective of more complex model inference challenges. See, e.g., this popular press article https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/gpt-4-researchers-tested-leading-ai-models-for-copyright-infringement.html. \n\nOur sensitive data example is a toy example that is similar-in-kind to detecting if copyrighted information was in the pre-training / finetuning data of a black-box model, if private or personal information is in the pre-training / finetuning data of a black-box model, etc. We\u2019d argue that this is one of the major legal and ethical data security & privacy problems of the current technological era.\n\n> You provide results ...\n\nWe are not aware of any black-box methods that are capable of addressing our setting. We\u2019d be happy to include comparisons if you could direct us to the methods that you have in mind!\n\nNB: The response to the rest of your review is provided in a follow on comment."

We have addressed your review below. \n\n$ \\textbf{Summary} $:\n\nWe think your summary is a fair description of our work.\n\n$ \\textbf{Strengths} $:\n\nWe agree that it is important to develop black-box methods to address model-level inference in scenarios where the score function is not formalized or unavailable. We think that the level of importance is still growing -- especially with large corporations putting retrieval-enabled language models on user\u2019s phones, tablets, etc. and the ongoing pursuit of \"digital twins\" of society with the current cohort of language models.\n\n$ \\textbf{Weaknesses}:\n\n> Distinction ...\n\nThe distinction between the current submission and [1] is that we analyze the representations of the models in the estimated DKPS with respect to a subsequent inference task. The results of [1] essentially say that the low-dimensional representations of the models in the DKPS are consistent for a true-but-unknown set of low-dimensional representations of the models. They do not have a notion of model-level covariates. As such, they do not explicitly comment on the utility of the representations or on the convergence of decision rules. \n\n> The toxicity and bias ... \n\nYes, the model\u2019s covariate correlates with the size of the point. & yes, the nature of bias and toxicity is more complicated than the other two examples. One of the goals of the bias/toxicity example was to demonstrate that functional difference (as measured by \u201ccloseness\u201d in DKPS) is more important than model lineage (as measured by \u201ccloseness\u201d in the model graph), even when the relationship between the DKPS and the covariate is non-linear. Also, while we only highlight a single set of neighbors in the model graph and the two DKPS, the relative error shown in the bottom right of Figure 4 is actually the average relative error over all models in the model tree. We will make sure to make that more clear. We will also emphasize the comparison of \u201cfunctional\u201d versus \u201clineage\u201d. \n\n> The proposed approach ...\n\nOur goal is to be a practical extension of the more theoretical [1], and so we greatly appreciate your suggestions. Beyond the illustrative example, we tried to pick two interesting experiments demonstrating practicality and attempted to highlight potential impact of important hyperparameters. For example, we explored sensitivity to an important hyperparameter (the distribution of queries G) to show that consistency of the estimated DKPS is *not* the only important thing, as one might think after reading [1]. \n\nWe think of the sensitive data classification example as a simple experiment related to predicting if a model has had access to copy-righted or private information, which we think is one of the biggest ethical and legal questions related to training and using generative models. See, for example, this popular press article: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/gpt-4-researchers-tested-leading-ai-models-for-copyright-infringement.html. \n\nRelated to the question of the blue model being more (or less) toxic than the red model, we agree that this is an important question. We expect that one use case for DKPS will be to quickly identify not-passable models so that resources can be better used to evaluate promising models. For example, we could safely remove models from consideration if they are close to the more toxic blue model and only spend evaluation resources on models close to the less toxic red model.\n\n$ \\textbf{Questions} $:\n\n>How this work ...\n\n[1] introduces DKPS and focuses entirely on the behavior of the estimate of the DKPS. It shows that the estimated DKPS is consistent for a true-but-unknown geometry of models. [1] does not try to demonstrate the utility of the estimated DKPS with respect to model-level inference. As such, we extend the theoretical results to include inference and (attempt to) show that the DKPS is broadly applicable to many model-level problems. \n\n> Did I understand ...\n\nFigure 4 (right, bottom) shows the average performance of the classifiers across all models in the model graph. \n\n> Is my understanding ...\n\nThere are many reasons why we might now see clear dependence in the DKPS space. One might be because two dimensions is not enough to capture it perfectly. Others, as you pointed out, may be due to the choice in hyperparameters such as the query set, the embedding function, the choice of metric on the models, etc. With that said, the shown DKPS is still better than other simple methods for trying to predict toxicity / bias, such as using the model graph or using the global average. This highlights that while the covariate signal in the DKPS is not necessarily linear, there is still a signal in the shown DKPS geometry.\n\n> On line 112 ...\n\nYes!

We have addressed your review below. \n\n$ \\textbf{Summary} $:\n\nWe think your summary is a fair description of our work.\n\n$ \\textbf{Strengths} $:\n\nWe agree that trying to understand various aspects of the ever-growing set of generative models is extremely important. Our goal was to abstract away a lot of the different types of differences in models (such as model weights, augmentation strategies, generation parameters, etc.) in a single, unified framework.\n\n$ \\textbf{Weaknesses} $:\n> I found the work to be trying to be too general ...\n\nThank you for this feedback. One of our goals in writing this paper is to establish a general approach to thinking about model-level analysis and inference. Our method -- inference in the data kernel perspective space (DKPS) -- allows for classical statistical inference (classification, regression, etc.) of Euclidean representations of the models. Since we treat the models as black boxes, the method is agnostic to different types of model differences such as model weights, generation settings, or augmentation strategies. While we may sacrifice depth for breadth, we think it is important to make sure that the reader is aware that the DKPS framework can handle a variety of types of model differences.\n\nOur contribution is not intended to be that a particular decision function (1-NN, LDA, etc.) is the best for a particular task. It is to demonstrate that the model representations that are presented in Acharrya et al. can be used in the context of model-level inference. As such, we agree that a logistic regression model trained on the same model-level embeddings (from DKPS) would be effective for the \u201cWas RA Fisher great?\u201d task.\n\nOur theoretical results are very related to our empirical results. In particular, Theorem 1 states that as we get more queries (m) the performance of any classifier gets closer to the performance of the classifier trained on the true representations of the models. Indeed, we see that an increase in m corresponds to an increase in performance across all of the experimental settings. Similarly, Theorem 2 states that if a sequence of decision rules trained on the true-but-unknown representations of the models is consistent then the analogous sequence of decision rules trained on the estimated representations of the models is also consistent. This explains why we see performance improvements as a function of the number of models (n) in both the \u201cWas Fisher great?\u201d and \u201cHas a model seen sensitive data\u201d examples.\n\nWe are a bit confused by your comment related to \u201cresults concerning actual statistical tests appear to be from other established tests, executed after the initial embedding in this [DKPS]\u201d. As mentioned above, our contribution is *exactly* that inference in the DKPS is meaningful. We show this in classification settings, regression settings, and hypothesis testing settings. We think that this is an extremely important contribution, as there are currently no existing methods of getting model representations (that we know of, please point us to them if they exist!) that achieve this type of utility for populations of black-box models.\n\n\n> Additionally ...\n\nWe plan to edit the background and generic statistical inference framework sections to be more reader friendly. Any suggestions that would help make these sections more readable would be greatly appreciated. \n\n> Finally, I have some general concerns about the soundness of the foundations ... \n\nThis is a super fair and valid concern.Tracking perspectives of interacting language models has recently been published at EMNLP. Consistent estimation of generative model representations in the data kernel perspective space is currently under review at a dedicated statistics venue. This field is quite new and progress is fast-paced. \n\nWith that said, the current work builds upon more established theoretical work related to inference in learned node embedding spaces of random graphs.

In general, we let $ i $ & $ i\u2019 $ index models and $ j $ and $ j\u2019 $ index queries.\n\n$ r $ represents the number of responses from a given model for a particular query. For example, if we fix the model to be GPT4 and the query to be \u201cWhat is your favorite color?\u201d then $ f_{i} (q_{j})1, ..,  f_{i}(q_{j})r $ could be \u201cred\u201d, \u201cred\u201d, \u201cblue\u201d, .., \u201cred\u201d. This type of repeated querying is typically necessary in black-box settings to characterize the response distribution $ F_{ij} $. We recognize that all of this notation can be quite cumbersome, but we believe it to be necessary when first describing the setting and methodology.\n\n> The second paragraph ...\n\nAfter introducing the necessary notation, we wanted to re-orient the reader to our goal and to let them know that we sometimes are loose with what variables represent (either a realization of the random variable X or the random variable X) before proceeding.\n\n> Line 102 ...\n\nYes, it is quite a mouthful -- though we tried to make it precise. Can you suggest an alternative?\n\n> Lines 189-192 ...\n\nWe wanted to be careful when presenting the theoretical results because consistency results are oftentimes confused with optimality results. In our case, we included the quotation marks because there are different notions of optimality here -- optimality with respect to the class of decision functions, optimality with respect to the distribution $ P_{\\psi Y} $, and optimality with respect to the distribution $ P_{f Y} $.\n\nWe plan to improve our discussion of these nuances to allow for discussion of optimality without quotation marks.\n\n> In general, from the text after theorems 1 and 2 ...\n\nThat is a fair point. Again, we wanted to be careful when presenting the results so as to not oversell them. The results are actually quite informative and impactful -- Theorem 1 says that inference in estimated DKPS is consistent for inference in the true-but-unknown DKPS. Theorem 2 says if a sequence of decision functions (such as k-NN, SVMs, etc.) is known to be consistent for $ P_{\\psi y} $ when trained on the true-but-unknown $ \\psi $, then the analogous sequence of classifiers constructed with the estimated DKPS is also consistent for $ P_{\\psi y} $. Essentially, Theorem 1 comments on the effect of $ m $ and Theorem 2 comments on the effect of $ n $. We see both of the theoretical results in action in the \u201cWas RA Fisher great?\u201d and \u201cHas a model had access to sensitive-data data\u201d examples: as m gets bigger the performance improves (Theorem 1) and as n gets bigger the performance improves (Theorem 2).\n\nWe plan to improve our discussion around the Theorem results, as well, to include more insights as to what they *do* say, as well as keeping the current discussion around what they *do not* say.\n\n> Line 796 ...\n\nOur goal with appending fruit names to the end of the original 50 augmentations was to perturb the original augmentations slightly so as to get relatively densely populated regions of the DKPS. It is a cheap way to get more \u201cmodels\u201d for which the behavior in DKPS would be easy to interpret. We thought that this was particularly important given that the treatment of our setting as a classical supervised learning problem is relatively new.  \n\n\n> Overall ...\n\nThank you for your helpful feedback!

Line 102: \"is the average difference between the average embedded response between\" - it's hard to understand.\n\n5. Lines 189-192. The text is difficult to understand, perhaps it should be rephrased and the multiple repetitive \"that\" removed. Why is the word \"optimal\" in quotation marks here? In what sense do you understand optimality here?\n\n6. In general, from the text after theorems 1 and 2, at first glance it looks like nothing at all follows from the theorems (\"The result does not provide instructions\";  \"Nor does it provide insight\"; \"does not provide guidance\"; \"it is unclear how\"). Perhaps this text should be rephrased and it should be more clearly outlined what follows from these theorems and how you use them further in the work.\n\n7. Line 796: \"we appended the name of ten random fruits, e.g., \u201cbanana\u201d ... \". I don't understand how fruits came to be here, perhaps the authors should explain this.\n\nOverall, it seems to me that the work is very relevant, but before presenting it at the conference, the text and style of presentation should be significantly revised. Therefore, I cannot recommend this work for acceptance."

Throughout the detailing of the methodology, it is unclear what the precise goal is when trying to construct this statistical inference framework for generative models. I understand the general intent to perform inference in the presence of multiple different models, different generations, and different settings; however, in covering so much it is not obvious if anything meaningful can come out of so many degrees of freedom in the setup. The empirical findings are not too convincing to me, as the theory developed does not appear to tie too closely to the results. For example, in Figure 1, could be equivalently achieved with a logistic regression model trained on the same embeddings. Any results concerning actual statistical tests appear to be from other established tests, executed after the initial embedding in this \"data kernel perspective space\".\n\nAdditionally, I feel that in striving to make this approach generic and applicable to many different settings, the text became fairly unreadable and indecipherable to me. The mix of background on the data kernel perspective space mixed with adapting it to a generic statistical inference framework introduced a lot of notation in what I found to be a very terse manner. \n\nFinally, I have some general concerns about the soundness of the foundations that this work builds upon. In section 1.1, a great deal of deference is made to previous works that this paper builds off of. In particular, the three listed below, with specific emphasis on the first. This paper claims to develop further results in this line of work, it does appear to heavily rely on the theoretical findings of these previous ones. I bring this up because all of these papers are preprints that have come out in the past 1.5 years (two in the past 6 months), with absolutely no citations (except between themselves) and no peer review. For more empirical-leaning work, this wouldn't cause me much concern but I feel for such a theoretically positioned paper, it is important that the foundation being built upon is trustworthy.\n1.

Leveraging the Data Kernel Perspective Spaces framework, the proposed method allows to embed models into shared geometric space based on models' responses to a set of queries. These responses are embedded with an external embedder and are averaged. The distance matrix between the models in the collection is then formed based on the differences in the averaged embedded responses. The model embedding is then obtained by applying a multidimensional scaling on the obtained distance matrix. Thus, MDS provides the d-dimensional vector representations for the collection of models called data kernel perspective space. \n\nThe submission also offers consistency results for the proposed approach, which essentially say that if one increases the number of queries, learning on the observed data kernel perspectives (model embeddings) will be close enough to learning on true unknown perspectives.\n\nTo enable analysis and model property inference, the approach requires a careful design of the query set and a set of labelled models which could either be obtained from external sources (scores from benchmarks) or fine-tuning models on the controllable training sets to form a reference model set with labels. By analysing distances and configurations within DKPS, one can infer similarities and differences in model behaviours, even if these models differ in architecture, training data, or parameters. The subsequent empirical study explores the viability of this approach."

                "value": "1. Distinction with prior work is not clear to me. After a quick glance at [1], which current submission heavily relies on (DKPS, consistent representations, the empirical illustration with RA Fisher greatness, ablations), it is difficult to distinguish the contributions of the current paper because distinctions are not clearly stated. I would appreciate if authors could specify how their current work departs from the previous research.\n\n2. The toxicity and bias experiments are not entirely clear to me. The model's covariate correlates with the size of the point in Figure 4 (right, top), which demonstrates that DKPS doesn't provide a simple configuration for these particular covariates unlike the previous example in Figure 2. Surely, this is expected, since both bias and toxicity are of a more complex nature. But this also highlights that limitation of the proposed approach. Although, the 1-NN in DKPS space for the particular example (green, blue and red models) shows benefit over other simple regressors, it would be more convincing to see this result at scale. As far as I understood, Figure 4. (right, bottom) is also computed for one unlabelled model and underlines the hardness of the problem.\n\n3. The proposed approach highly depends on the design choices and it is not explored how much effort is required to produces pipelines that are descriptive and practical enough. If this work positions itself as a practical extension of the theoretical framework introduced in prior work, the undeniable contribution would be to provide a convincing practical application. For example, although the existing experiment with toxicity and bias helps understand that green model is closer to less toxic red model than the more toxic blue model, this doesn't answer the question whether it can be less toxic than the red one, which is probably the question practitioners would be interested in. Finding a better scenario to showcase the strength of the proposed approach, would help this submission greatly.\n\n[1] Acharyya, Aranyak, et al. \"Consistent estimation of generative model representations in the data kernel perspective space.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.17308 (2024)."

Is my understanding right that we cannot see the clear dependence in the DKPS spaces with the covariates in Figure 4 right top because the complex nature of the covariates?
