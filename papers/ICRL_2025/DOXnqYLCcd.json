    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the problem of dynamic multi-product selection and pricing by introducing a novel framework based on a *censored multinomial logit* (C-MNL) choice model. In this model, sellers present a set of products with prices, and buyers filter out products priced above their valuation, purchasing at most one product from the remaining options based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize seller revenue by dynamically adjusting product offerings and prices, while learning both product valuations and buyer preferences through purchase feedback. To achieve this, we propose a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) pricing strategy. By combining this pricing strategy with either an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling (TS) product selection approach, our algorithms achieve regret bounds of $\\tilde{O}(d^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\tilde{O}(d^{2}\\sqrt{T})$, respectively. Finally, we validate the performance of our methods through simulations, demonstrating their effectiveness.",

                "value": "The authors study the dynamic multi-product selection problem. They introduce a new censored multinomial logit (C-MNL) choice model, capturing buyer behavior by filtering products based on price thresholds. They propose two algorithms that leverage a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) pricing strategy, combined with either an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling (TS) approach for selecting product assortments. Both algorithms achieve provable regret upper bounds, and their performance is further validated through simulations."

                "value": "This paper studies the problem of online pricing and assortment optimization, where a seller engages in repeated interactions with a buyer over $ T $ discrete time steps. In this setting, the seller offers a selection of products from a set of size $ N $. At each time step $ t $, the seller chooses an assortment $ S_t \\subseteq [N] $ of products to present to the buyer, along with a specific price $ p_{i,t} $ for each item $ i \\in S_t $.\n\nThe buyer is characterized by latent parameters $ \\theta_v $ and $ \\theta_{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d $, which influence their purchasing decisions but remain unknown the seller. Each product $ i \\in S_t $ is associated with known feature vectors $ x_{i,t} $ and $ w_{i,t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d $, representing various characteristics of the items. The buyer's valuation of a product is given by $v_{i,t} =  x_{i,t}^T \\theta_v $, while their price sensitivity is described by the parameter $ \\alpha_{i,t} = w_{i,t}^T \\theta_{\\alpha} $. Consequently, the buyer's utility for a product $ i $ is defined as $ v_{i,t} - \\alpha_{i,t} p_{i,t} $. The buyer makes a purchasing decision based on a \"censored multinomial logit choice function,\" which acts as a sigmoid function applied to all items $ i \\in S_t $ for which the price $ p_{i,t} $ does not exceed the buyer\u2019s value $ v_{i,t} $.\n\nThe goal is to minimize regret compared to the optimal assortment and pricing decisions in hindsight. A key challenge is that the seller lacks information on which products are \"censored\" by the buyer's multinomial logit choice function (i.e., $v_{i,t} < p_{i,t}$). This uncertainty makes it challenging for the seller to glean information from the buyer's purchasing behavior. To address this, the authors employ a combination of algorithms: a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) approach for setting prices and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) method for selecting assortments. By using the LCB algorithm, prices are initially set low, reducing the likelihood that items will be censored in the early stages. This enables the algorithm to gather more accurate data on the buyer's latent parameters, $ \\theta_v $ and $ \\theta_{\\alpha} $. This algorithm obtains a regret bound of $ O(d^{2/3}T^{1/2}) $."

If none, this section might not be necessary and could be removed to streamline the paper.\n-\tAdditionally, I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of why the latent price sensitivity parameter $ \\alpha_{i,t} $ is essential to the model. It would be helpful to have some real-world examples that illustrate the importance of including $ \\alpha_{i,t} $. Moreover, I find it counterintuitive that $ \\alpha_{i,t} $ appears in the exponent of the MNL choice function $ \\exp(v_{i,t} - \\alpha_{i,t} p_{i,t}) $, yet it does not appear in the indicator $ \\mathbb{1}(p_{i,t} \\leq v_{i,t}) $. Intuitively, it might make more sense if the indicator were formulated as $ \\mathbb{1}(\\alpha_{i,t} p_{i,t} \\leq v_{i,t}) $, as this would more consistently capture the influence of $ \\alpha_{i,t} $ on the decision threshold."
