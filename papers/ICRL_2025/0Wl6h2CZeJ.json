    "title": "RealTracker: Simpler and Better Point Tracking by Pseudo-Labelling Real Videos",
    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art point trackers are trained on synthetic data due to the difficulty of annotating real videos for this task.\nHowever, this can result in suboptimal performance due to the statistical gap between synthetic and real videos. In order to understand these issues better, we introduce RealTracker, comprising a new tracking model and a new semi-supervised training recipe. This allows real videos without annotations to be used during training by generating pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf teachers.\nThe new model eliminates or simplifies components from previous trackers, resulting in a simpler and smaller architecture.\nThis training scheme is much simpler than prior work and achieves better results using 1,000 times less data.\nWe further study the scaling behaviour to understand the impact of using more real unsupervised data in point tracking.\nThe model is available in online and offline variants and reliably tracks visible and occluded points.",

For DinoTracker3, pseudo-labelling is explored. Please illustrate more differences with these trackers for better highlighting the contributions;\n- Are there any specific concerns for choosing a teacher model for pseudo label generation? Does the better teacher model with higher tracking performance commonly lead to better tracking performance? Can a single teacher model well support the tracker learning?\n-  In Table 2, the time of the per frame and per tracked point is shown. For the online variant, what\u2019s the overall tracking speed (i.e., fps) given an online testing video?\n- Missing Refs for discussion.

                "value": "1. The methodology appears to be more engineering-oriented rather than theoretically innovative, primarily consisting of combinations and modifications of existing methods. The pseudo-label fine-tuning approach is relatively common. Given this is a **deep learning conference**, the technical contributions seem somewhat limited.\n2. As acknowledged in the limitations section, the model's improvement of performance is heavily dependent on the teacher model's capabilities. This strong reliance on existing methods' performance creates a ceiling effect where the training results are constrained by the teacher model's performance limits, potentially reducing the method's generalizability.\n3. The authors aim to bridge the domain gap using real-world dataset training. However, the paper lacks substantial technical innovation in terms of cross-domain adaptation techniques. The approach merely relies on real-data fine-tuning and teacher model voting effects for enhanced robustness, neither of which represents a significant contribution to the field of domain adaptation. More sophisticated cross-domain strategies or novel technical approaches would have strengthened the paper's contribution in addressing the domain gap problem."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The terminology \"self-supervised fine-tuning\" is indeed questionable in this context. Using state-of-the-art models from the same domain to generate pseudo-labels for supervision is more aligned with teacher-student learning or pseudo-labeling approaches rather than traditional self-supervised learning, where the supervision signals are typically derived from the data itself without external models.\n\n2. The incorporation of domain adaptation strategies during the fine-tuning process would have significantly enhanced the paper's contribution. This could have included techniques specifically designed to address domain shift and better align feature distributions between source and target domains."
