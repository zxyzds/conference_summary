    "title": "Binary Reward Labeling: Bridging Offline Preference and Reward-Based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning has become one of the most practical RL settings. However, most existing works on offline RL focus on the standard setting with scalar reward feedback. It remains unknown how to universally transfer the existing rich understanding of offline RL from the reward-based to the preference-based setting. In this work, we propose a general framework to bridge this gap. Our key insight is transforming preference feedback to scalar rewards via binary reward labeling (BRL), and then any reward-based offline RL algorithms can be applied to the dataset with the reward labels. The information loss during the feedback signal transition is minimized with binary reward labeling in the practical learning scenarios. We theoretically show the connection between several recent PBRL techniques and our framework combined with specific offline RL algorithms. By combining reward labeling with different algorithms, our framework can lead to new and potentially more efficient offline PBRL algorithms. We empirically test our framework on preference datasets based on the standard D4RL benchmark. When combined with a variety of efficient reward-based offline RL algorithms, the learning result achieved under our framework is comparable to training the same algorithm on the dataset with actual rewards in many cases and better than the recent PBRL baselines in most cases.",

The authors propose a method called Binary Reward Labeling (BRL), which transforms preference feedback into scalar rewards, allowing the application of any reward-based offline RL algorithm to datasets with reward labels. The key insight is simply relabel the reward function with $\\pm 1$ using preference labels.

For example, in Definition 4.2, there should be a period after \"reward modeling in model-based approaches,\" and the comma should not appear at the start of a line. The subtitle \"Offline standard RL algorithms are model-based.\" in Section 4.2 can be misleading.\n\n- The soundness of the proposed method is questionable. While the $\\pm 1$ reward labeling is theoretically correct, it is usually not a good choice to overfit the preference dataset. Having a more rigorous analysis under the function approximation scenario would be nice.\n\n- The paper needs some benchmarks and baselines to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For benchmarks, The D4RL benchmark is known to be insensitive to the accuracy of the reward function [1], and adding benchmarks like Meta-World would greatly strengthen the paper. Also, there are some recent works on offline PbRL that have a strong performance, like [2,3], and BRL should be compared with them.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Li, Anqi, et al. \"Survival instinct in offline reinforcement learning.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 36 (2024).\n\n[2] Kim, Changyeon, et al. \"Preference transformer: Modeling human preferences using transformers for rl.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.00957 (2023).\n\n[3] Zhang, Zhilong, et al. \"Flow to better: Offline preference-based reinforcement learning via preferred trajectory generation.\" The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2023."

The authors state that the main goal is to develop a framework to bridge the gap between PbRL and standard RL, allowing a standard offline RL algorithm to address the PbRL problem. However, the primary motivation behind PbRL is to resolve the challenge of setting rewards in standard RL. The difficulty in PbRL lies in accurately learning rewards from human preferences, which is not a problem that standard offline RL addresses. The author could approach this from the perspective of overlapping (or similar) trajectories and inconsistent labels, which might lead to a more effective explanation.\n\n3) Theory: Theoretical 4.5 only considers the case of non-overlapping trajectories and does not account for the scenario of overlapping trajectories with inconsistent labels.\n\n4) Experiments: The dataset is limited, with experiments conducted solely in the mujoco tasks.
