    "title": "Dynamic Taylor Convolutional Neural Network for Few-Shot Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Few-shot Point cloud semantic segmentation remains a challenge in the field of computer vision due to the limitations of the pre-training learning paradigm and insufficient local geometric structure representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel pre-training-free Dynamic Taylor Convolutional Neural Network, called DyTaylorCNN ingeniously, which combines the potential of the Taylor series in local structure representation with the flexibility and adaptability of dynamic convolutions. The core of DyTaylorCNN lies in two innovative components: the Dynamic Taylor Convolution (DyTaylorConv) and the Interactive Prototype Refinement (IPR) Module. Inspired by the Taylor series and dynamic convolution, DyTaylorConv performs local structure fitting by collaborating between the Low-order Convolution (LoConv) and the Dynamic High-order Convolution (DyHiConv). LoConv is designed based on position encoding, focusing on extracting the basic geometric information of point clouds, while DyHiConv adaptively models complex local geometric features by learning spatial priors to generate dynamic weights. Moreover, the IPR Module effectively reduces the domain distribution gap by learning fine-grained prototype features, further enhancing the model's generalization capability. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DyTaylorCNN significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",

                "value": "This paper tackles the challenge of few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation by proposing DyTaylorCNN, a pre-training-free neural network that leverages the Taylor series and dynamic convolutions to enhance local structure representation. DyTaylorCNN introduces two modules: Dynamic Taylor Convolution (DyTaylorConv) and an Interactive Prototype Refinement (IPR) Module. DyTaylorConv combines Low-order Convolution (LoConv), which extracts basic geometric information, and Dynamic High-order Convolution (DyHiConv), which adapts to complex geometric structures using spatial priors. Although the proposed method with these modules shows impressive performance on few-shot point cloud segmentation benchmarks, there are a few concerns related to the novelty and comparison as described in the weakness section."

Based on Tables 3-(a) and 4-(b), it seems that the performance gain mainly comes from Prototype Enhancement Module (PEM) and Prototype Refinement Module (PRM). Then, why do we need DyTaylorConv for few-shot 3D semantic segmentation? If DyTaylorConv is indeed effective, then I recommend the authors to evaluate its effectiveness on general 3D perception tasks (e.g., ScanNet semantic segmentation, ScanObjectNN shape classification) since it is not a specially designed for few-shot 3D semantic segmentation but a general operator. \\\n- Regarding to Low-order Convolution, if it is designed for capturing basic structural information, why don't you just use RepSurf [1]? I recommend the authors to compare Low-order Convolution with RepSurf.\n\n[1] Ran et al., \"Surface Representation for Point Clouds\", CVPR, 2022."
