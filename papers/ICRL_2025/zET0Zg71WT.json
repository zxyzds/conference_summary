    "abstract": "The introduction of the Transformer has brought about a revolution in AI. Central to the success of the Transformer architecture is the self-attention mechanism, enabling context dependence and long-range dependencies between tokens. Recent work has drawn an equivalence between Hopfield networks, a kind of associative memory model, and Transformers. In this work, we leverage this bridge, using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), a brain-inspired computational paradigm capable of representing and implementing data structures, including associative memory models, to define a broad class of attention mechanisms catered for complex data types. In particular, we use Generalized Holographic Reduced Representations (GHRR), an implementation of a VSA, as the foundation for our proposed class of attention mechanisms. We show that GHRR is capable of implementing attention and design a GHRR Transformer encoder architecture based on the demonstrated mathematical equivalence. We propose a new kind of binding-based positional encoding based on methods used in VSAs for encoding sequential information. We extend the attention mechanism in our architecture to support graphs, inspired by techniques used in VSAs to encode graph representations. We evaluate the GHRR Transformer on language modeling, vertex classification, and graph classification tasks. Results suggest that our approach provides benefits in language modeling and graph classification tasks compared to baseline models.",

This makes the work, in principle, able to achieve some impact on the community.\n\n *  The proposed approach, surprisingly, does not imply a substantially higher parameterization and computational costs (at least according to what the Authors state in the paper, as there is no specific experimental data supporting this claim)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* The work appears rather derivative when coming down to the learning methodology. The model underlying the proposed GHRR Transformer derives largely from Yeung et al 2024, aside from the part which integrate positional encoding information in the neural representation. Overall, the proposed equivalence of GHRR to self-attention boils down to a resemblance of the matrix operations involved in self-attention, when substantial constraints are imposed to the GHRR model. There is really no deep study and assessment of the relationship between the GHRR Transformer and self-attention, and of what are the consequences of some design choices and simplifications introduced in GHRR. Without a deeper insight on the key advantages introduced by the proposed GHRR-Transformer/Self-attention equivalence, this may appear rather empty and mostly a technical exercise.  The equivalence itself hinges on quite strong simplifying assumptions, which are mentioned but whose impact is not discussed in depth.  For instance, GHRR assumes a fixed context window: if such assumption is relaxed, then the dimensions of the embedding becomes entangled, loosing the very motivation for having introduced an holographic representation in a first instance. This aspect is mentioned in the paper, but only marginally, while it seems a major limitation of the approach.\n\n* The work appears derivative also with respect to the contribution on graph processing. The encoding of graph data in the proposed GHRR Transformer is heavily based on Poduval et al, 2022. The paper is not clear about what novel insight is being provided on graph encoding by the proposed approach against the one of GraphHD. It would be helpful if the Authors could elaborate more on what are the novelties of the proposed approach agains GraphHD. The technical discussion on the properties of the GHRR Transformer against what is the state of the art in graph NNs, remain on  a shallow level. For instance, if I got this right, the disentanglement properties of the proposed Holographic embedding should allow to memorize exact information about inter-nodes relationships in the vertex encoding. This may be relevant with respect to the literature discussion about how to design graph NNs capable of capturing long range node relationships, surpassing limitations such as oversquashing. The work appears not well positioned with respect to relevant literature in this respect.\n\n * The work, at some point, relaxes the assumption on W being unitary. My understanding is that such an assumption in needed to preserve the holographic nature of the embeddings. It cannot be relaxed without a proper discussion of how this affects the properties of the model (the discussion should be both theoretical and empirical in this sense). Taking assumptions which contradict the very fundamental reasons for having introduced the holographic approach in the first instance, reduces the soundness of the contribution.\n\n * The empirical analysis is very limited in scope, depth and reproducibility. Little details are provided as concerns the experimental setup  and no reference to code is given (neither public anonimyzed nor attached to the submission as supplementary). It would be helpful if the Authors can provide additional details to facilitate reproducibility, including choice of optimizers, hyperparameters, as well as to gain a deeper insight into the computational charateristics of the approach, such as its computational costs and parameterization in the experiments.\n\n* The experiments on sequential data are too limited: only a single 2-dataset experiment with simple next token prediction tasks is provided. If the approach is put forward as an holographic equivalent of Transformers (in year 2024), then one would expect to see experiments on how the approach can be used to at least match a Transformer on proper language modeling tasks. The experiments with graph data are quite poor. There is no reference baseline model from literature (I would have expected a comparison with at least the most popular Graph Transformer models). The datasets used in the experiments are not widely recognized benchmarks by the graph NN community and this does not allow to compare the proposed model against the relevant related literature. The dataset on graph classification cannot be considered a proper graph benchmark: deciding between a fully connected and a non-fully connected graph does not require a model with the ability to capture complex structured relationships in a graph. It suffices a model which can count the number of ones in the adjacency matrix."
