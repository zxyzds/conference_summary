    "title": "AlphaMol: rigid neighborhood representation for small molecule structure prediction",
    "abstract": "Recent success of the deep learning-based approach AlphaFold2 revolutionized the field of protein structure prediction. Since AlphaFold2 development, a lot of efforts were made to shape its limitations as well as to improve it further with respect to difficult protein classes. However, structure prediction of non-protein type of molecules, such as small organic molecules, non-standard amino acids, nucleic acids, and others, is still an open problem. Inspired by the powerful AlphaFold2 neural network architecture, we developed a general framework for prediction of molecular structures of arbitrary type. Specifically, we developed novel representation of molecular structures as a collection of rigid-body neighborhoods with encoded bonds between the neighborhoods fed into neural network comprising developed Evoformer-like blocks. We tested our approach on small organic molecules, that possess much higher variability in terms of atomic composition and structural patterns compared to proteins. Namely, we applied the developed method, named AlphaMol, to the ground-state structure prediction problem of small molecules and observed superior performance metrics on the PubChemQC benchmark, compared to the existing approaches. Our results demonstrate possibility to create multi-modal molecular structure prediction methods, that operate across different molecular types. The AlphaMol source code is available in the repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AlphaMol-2EA7.",

                "value": "The primary objective of the paper is to establish a robust architecture for modeling diverse molecular types, ultimately aiming to create a generalized framework capable of managing various molecular modalities. The authors address the small molecule conformer generation challenge by conceptualizing it as a connected set of rigid bodies. They extract commonly available rigid bodies that serve as fundamental building blocks for the majority of molecules in their dataset. A  featurization scheme is introduced, incorporating aspects of chirality and symmetry, with these features subsequently processed through modified sequential Evoformer blocks to produce 2D molecular geometries."

                "value": "- **Clarity Issues**:\n    - The clarity of the manuscript is notably poor; the introduction is overly condensed into a single paragraph, and the writing is characterized by terse sentences. A comprehensive rewrite is essential to enhance clarity, including the use of shorter sentences and multiple paragraphs to delineate contributions clearly.\n    - The algorithms are inadequately formatted, rendering them challenging to read. Simplistic implementations need not be presented as formal algorithms; a descriptive narrative suffices.\n    - The manuscript lacks descriptions of adequate motivation for the addressed problem, leading to insufficient context for readers. There is a disconnection between the problem statement and the proposed solutions.\n    - Methodological explanations, particularly in Section 2, lack clarity and rigor, often employing casual language. Figure 2, in its current state, requires significant improvement to convey its intended message effectively.\n- **Comparative Analysis**:\n    - The comparisons with existing algorithms are insufficient. While the authors mention RDKit and ETKDG, there is a notable absence of comparisons with more recent methodologies, such as Torsional Diff [1].\n    - Furthermore, standard evaluation metrics such as Precision and Recall are not reported, which are routinely used in evaluation of small molecule conformer generation models.\n    - The rational for using PubChemQC as the target dataset is not convincingly justified over alternatives like GEOM-DRUGS[2], which are commonly used in this domain.\n\n[1] Jing, Bowen, et al. \"Torsional diffusion for molecular conformer generation.\"\u00a0*Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*\u00a035 (2022): 24240-24253.\n\n[2] Simon Axelrod and Rafael G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli.

Has the potential overlap with AlphaFold 3[3] been considered, as it appears to address similar objectives? Does this render the current approach somewhat redundant? Could the authors clearly articulate the main contributions and motivation of the paper under this context ? \n\n[3] Abramson, Josh, et al. \"Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3.\"\u00a0*Nature*\u00a0(2024): 1-3."

A key innovation is the factorization of molecular isomorphisms, which allows the model to handle complex, long-tail molecules like lipids with extended carbohydrate chains, an area where other methods often fall short. The authors also enhanced training stability by modifying the Evoformer block, incorporating the Reparam method, a scalarization approach for equivariance, and the Gram-Schmidt process to manage rotations, which removed the need for learning rate scheduling and running exponential averaging."
