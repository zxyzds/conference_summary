    "abstract": "Publishers who publish their content on the web act strategically, in a behavior that can be modeled within the online learning framework. \nRegret, a central concept in machine learning, serves as a canonical measure for assessing the performance of learning agents within this framework.\nWe prove that any proportional content ranking function with a concave activation function induces games in which no-regret learning dynamics converge. \nMoreover, for proportional ranking functions, we prove the equivalence of the concavity of the activation function, the social concavity of the induced games and the concavity of the induced games.\nWe also study the empirical trade-offs between publishers' and users' welfare, under different choices of the activation function, using a state-of-the-art no-regret dynamics algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of the ranking function and changes in the ecosystem structure affect these welfare measures, as well as the dynamics' convergence rate.",

                "value": "I really appreciate the author for the detailed clarification. I think your explanation about the soundness of Lemma 1 makes sense to me.\n\nIn fact, after a closer look at the proof of Lemma 2.2 in [8], I realize that I indeed missed a key point, that is, in any socially-concave game, condition A1 and A2 already imply the fact that each player's utility is concave in her own action (which is exactly what Lemma 2.2 in [8] was trying to prove). That said, I should thank the reviewer again for resolving a latent misunderstanding about the property of socially-concave games. \n\nFor the authors' justification about the significance of stability guarantee, it makes a reasonable sense to me. My criticism is mainly from a theoretical perspective, as convergence in average is a weak concept. However, in this specific application context, I agree it is meaningful. However, I'm still curious about whether under certain conditions the publisher game under no-regret dynamics could end up in cycling (i.e., the joint strategy will neither converge nor diverge, but cycles around a NE). It would be very interesting if the author could come up with an example showing that such a pattern can indeed happen. If such example is hard to construct, adding a short discussion to acknowledge the gap between a relatively weaker theoretical guarantee and a strong empirical observation would also strengthen the paper.\n\nOverall I think the author response is satisfactory and refreshes my understanding about the value of this work. I decide to increase my scores (Contribution: 1: poor -> 3: good,  and Rating: 3 -> 6 ) and lean towards acceptance."

We discuss the similarities and differences between our and theirs below, and will be happy to incorporate this discussion into the camera-ready version if the paper is accepted.\n\n[4] studies a novel model of content creation competition with GenAI, but does not allow for flexibility in the recommendation/ranking function, which plays a crucial role in our work. While they focus on particular incentive structures (exclusive/inclusive) and study the existence and characterization of NE (using the notion of monotone games), our model allows for a higher degree of flexibility in the ranking function selection, and the main result provides a characterization of those ranking function that induces a (socially-)concave game.\n\n[5] also utilizes monotone games to establish the existence of NE (under some mild conditions) in a model in which the utility of the publisher is similar to the case of $g(t) = exp(\\beta t)$ in our notations. Thereafter, they studied equilibrium welfare optimization using novel intervention mechanisms that induce structural publisher utilities different from those resulting from our PRFs. However, their model differs from ours in the way the incentives of the publishers can be controlled by the platform.\n\nPerhaps closest to us, [6] indeed study no-regret dynamics, but then again they focus on a particular structure of the exposure/rewarding mechanism of the platform, which stands in contrast to the flexibility enabled by our general definition of PRFs. Moreover, [6] do not study the existence of or convergence to NE, but rather study average welfare over time.\n\nWe view our work as complementary, as unlike those discussed, it provides a model in which the recommendation/ranking mechanism is general, in the sense that the platform can choose *any* activation $g$. We thereafter provide a closed and intuitive characterization of those activation functions for which the induced game is (socially-)concave. Indeed, monotonicity is stronger than social-concavity, and last-iterate convergence is better than average convergence. But to obtain these (important) results, [4,5,6] studied models that are less general, as they often fix certain components of the publishers\u2019 utility (such as the random-utility model, the softmax function, stronger assumptions on the distance function $d$, etc). In our view, this reflects a tradeoff between model generality and the strength of the results, both of which are crucial considerations. That being said, as we highlight in the previous point, we do believe that average convergence is a significant contribution with practical implications."

We hope that our response below helps in addressing your questions and comments.\n\n**Correctness of our theoretical results**\n\nWe believe that our theoretical result is indeed valid. First, notice that: \n\n(a) [8] proved that any socially-concave game is concave; and -\n\n(b) In our publisher games, the first condition of social-concavity (A1 in definition 1) is always satisfied (proved in the proof of Lemma 1), as we assume that $d$ is bi-convex. This means that, in our publisher games, satisfying the second condition of social-concavity (A2 in Definition 1) implies that the game is concave.\n\nThis aligns with the fact that for **concave and monotonically decreasing $g$**, the function $r_i(x_i,x_{-i})$ is indeed concave in $x_i$ for any fixed $x_{-i}$ (the monotonicity assumption of the activation function $g$ is stated in the definition of a PRF, L. 230, and its purpose is to ensure documents that are closer to the information need $x^*$ are exposed with higher probability). To see why, fix $C=\\sum_{j \\neq i} d(x_j,x^*)$, and denote:\n\n$ d(x_i) = d(x_i,x^*) $\n\n$ f(x_i) = g(d(x_i)) $\n\n$ h(t) = \\frac{t}{t+C} $\n\nThen, we want to show that the following function is concave:\n\n$ r_i(x_i,x_{-i}) = h(f(x_i)) $\n\nNow we use the fact $h$ is non-decreasing and our assumption that $g$ is decreasing (this assumption is stated in the paper and its purpose is to ensure documents that are closer to the information need get a better ranking):\n\n(a) $g$ is concave and non-increasing, and $d$ is convex, implying that $f$ is concave.\n\n(b) $h$ is concave and non-decreasing (in $R_+$, which contains the image of $f$), and $f$ is concave, implying that $r_i$ is concave.\n\n\n**Significance of our stability guarantee**\n\n While we acknoledge that last-iterate convergence is of strong interest, we would like to suggest that the average convergence guarantee also holds significant value in real-worl applications. Such a practical implication is discussed (and perhaps should be clarified) in the paragraph on *equilibrium learning strategy*.\n\nHere the story is as follows. Publisher $i$ hires an SEO agent that can engage for her in a no-regret algorithm for the first $T_i$ rounds (think of $T_i$ as determined e.g. by budget constraints). As we highlighted in the introduction, no-regret serves as a suitable framework to describe the strategic behavior employed in SEO.\n\nProposition 1 shows that, given that those stopping times are not too far from each other and sufficiently large, each agent can simply play deterministically her average (i.e., the strategy her SEO agent *learned* for her) and this process results in an approximate NE. \n\nWe find the interpretation of this story as particularly relevant, as indeed web pages owners might prefer not to engage with frequent content modifications themselves, and let an external expert do the hard work for them, under the guarantee that when the SEO agent concludes, the publisher\u2019s cannot do much better then simply following the learned strategy for all future periods. This holds, of course, under the assumption that *all* publishers use these SEO services, which we find plausible.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, we highlight that in all of the simulations we run to establish the empirical results of the paper, the dynamics also converged in the last-iteratation sense. Only when we significantly increase $\\lambda$ we are able to find instances in which dynamics converge in the average sense but diverge in the last-iterate sense. Importantly, these anecdotal and rare examples are highly non representative.  So, from a practical perspective, concave activations may induce even more robust ecosystems than guaranteed theoretically. We view both the theory and practice as fundamental in the study of stable recommendation systems design.\n\n\n[8] Even-Dar, E., Mansour, Y., & Nadav, U. (2009, May).

                "value": "**Publishers' initial documents in the simulations (Q3)**\n\nIn the simulations that appear in the main paper and appendices B1-B2 the initial documents are sampled uniformly i.d.d. In appendix B3 we provide additional simulations in which the uniformity and independence assumptions are relaxed, and we use a multivariate normal distribution to sample the initial documents and the information need, with possible correlations (see more details at the beginning of this appendix).\n\n**Equilibrium learning strategy and last-iterate convergence (Q4)**\n\n The goal of the paragraph on equilibrium learning strategy (and Proposition 1) is *not* to prove last-iterate convergence, but instead to motivate our result on average convergence. Here the story is as follows. Publisher $i$ hires an SEO agent that can engage for her in a no-regret algorithm for the first $T_i$ rounds (think of $T_i$ as determined e.g. by budget constraints). Proposition 1 shows that, given that those stopping times are not too far from each other and sufficiently large, each agent can simply play deterministically her average (i.e., the strategy her SEO agent *learned* for her) and this process results in an approximate NE. We find the interpretation of this story as particularly relevant, as indeed web pages owners might prefer not to engage with frequent content modifications themselves, and let an external expert do the hard work for them, under the guarantee that when the SEO agent concludes, the publisher\u2019s cannot do much better then simply following the learned strategy for all future periods.\n\nWhile it would indeed be ideal to also have some result on last-iterate convergence, we do not think your suggestion is sufficient to prove such a result. Even if the NE is unique, the resulting dynamics can be cyclic (i.e., the profile \u201cjumps around\u201d the equilibrium point), which means that the average convergence, but the last-iterate diverges. We also have an example for a particular game simulation in which this happens, but we also highlight that from a practical perspective, our simulations indicate that this is very rare as the vast majority of the simulations do converge in the last iteration. So, from a practical perspective, concave activation may induce even more robust ecosystems than guaranteed theoretically. We view both the theory and practice as fundamental in the study of stable recommendation systems design.\n\n\n\n**Suggestions:**\n* Thanks for noticing, this is a typo which is now resolved.\n* We appreciate your suggestion for this very interesting future direction."

We hope that our response below helps in addressing your questions and comments.\n\n**Welfare measures in equilibrium under concave activation (Q1)**\n\nWe agree that a theoretical welfare characterization is an important and technically interesting question. A necessary step in order to answer this question, as we are interested in welfare in equilibrium, is characterization of the equilibrium points. We find this characterization of independent interest. The equilibrium characterization is rather simple as it follows naturally from the concavity of the game. In a new appendix that appears in the new version of the paper we uploaded, we derive the explicit form of the equation system defining the equilibrium, and also further simplify it for the symmetric publishers\u2019 game case. As expected, the solution of these equations heavily depends on the specific activation function $g$, and understanding the effect of $g$ (as well as the other game parameters) on the welfare measures turns out to be non-trivial. We consider this a particularly relevant theoretical future direction.\n\n**Experimental setup (Q2)**\n\nWe will add experimental results with a higher number of publishers and will add these to the camera ready version (and will do our best to attach them during the discussion period). As for the comment on the demand distribution support, it is worth noting that in many real-world applications, the user population is clustered and is usually represented by a finite number of cluster centroids. In the context of recommendation systems, user clustering is useful in efficiently storing user data, or improving model performance by reducing the complexity of demand representation (for instance, [1]). In information retrieval, the assumption on discrete information needs can be seen as *subtopic retrieval* (for instance, [2]). \n\nHaving said that, we will examine the option to perform some no-regret dynamics simulations with continuous distributions in order to incorporate additional results into the camera-ready version.\nMoreover, an interesting future direction could involve distinguishing between a continuous actual population distribution and a discrete centroid distribution observed by the platform and the publishers.\n\n[1] Zarzour, H., Al-Sharif, Z., Al-Ayyoub, M., & Jararweh, Y.

As standard in the economic literature, our assumption that the publishers\u2019 utilities are linear in the exposure reflect their risk neutrality [1,2], which is a plausible assumption that was also largely adopted within the recent literature on strategic content providers. We agree that studying other structures, such as convex/concave functions of the exposure (reflecting risk seek/aversion, resp.) is indeed an interesting future direction.

                "value": "1. There might be a major technical flaw in Lemma 1. Since the socially concave game is a subclass of concave game, when one tries to verify the social-concavity of $u_i$, one should also verify that $u_i(x_i, x_{-i})$ is concave in $x_i$. However, neither the Definition 1 nor the proof of Lemma 1 considers this criterion. In fact, I think this loophole might not be easy to fix: the concavity of $g$ and convexity of $d$ are not sufficient to guarantee that a function of the form $r(x_i, x_{-i})=\\frac{g(d(x_i))}{g(d(x_i))+C}$ is concave in $x_i$ (one can easily come up with counterexamples). One possible fix is to assume that $\\lambda_i$ is sufficiently large so that even if we do not know the concavity of $\\frac{g(d(x))}{g(d(x))+C}$, $\\frac{g(d(x))}{g(d(x))+C}-\\lambda_i d(x_i)$ can still be concave due to the convexity of d(x_i). However, the dominance of the cost term in the utility model does not make much sense to me. I hope the authors explain this issue in detail in the response, otherwise, this flaw renders the main theoretical result in Theorem 2 groundless as well. \n\n2. The stability guarantee offered by the socially concave property is a weak one in my perspective and does not provide sufficient real-world implications. As the authors acknowledged in L. 168, only the average strategy sequence over time converges to the Nash equilibrium. This means it does not guarantee the last-iterate convergence (the most common convergence concept in practice) since it does not preclude the cycling pattern of strategies (which is commonly observed in many game structures, e.g., in [1], gradient dynamics can cycle in minimax zero-sum game). Such a weak notion of convergence makes me skeptical about the significance of the theoretical result.\n\n3. Insufficient related work. This paper tries to study no-regret dynamics running on a proposed SEO game which is socially concave: \n- Socially concave game is not a new concept: it is actually widely known as a criterion to verify monotone games (which is also a subclass of concave games and are extensively studied due to its provided nice convergence properties [2, 7]). The discussion of socially concave games can be found in appendix A.2 of [2], though without explicitly mentioning its name, and also [3]. I'm wondering since there are many works providing alternative dynamics that guarantee stronger last-iterate convergence in monotone (and thus socially concave) games, why the author insisted in establishing a weaker convergence result under no-regret dynamics. \n- Some related studies propose similar game structures modeling competition among content publishers, with a guarantee that the resulting game is monotone (see [4,5] and possibly more). \n- In addition, no-regret dynamics and their convergence in similar content publisher games are studied in [6]. \n\nOverall, I like the clear presentation and high-level conceptual contribution of this work. I lean towards rejection mainly due to: 1. a potential major technical flaw in the proof, and 2. the weak convergence guarantee and the insufficient discussion of related works make the contribution limited. However, I'm open to raising my score if the authors convince me there is something I have missed, or show a reasonable way to fix the first technical issue. \n\n[1] The Limit Points of (Optimistic) Gradient Descent in Min-Max Optimization, Neurips 2018\n[2] Bandit learning in concave N-person games, Neurips 2018\n[3] On existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points for concave N-person games, Econometrica 48(1) 251.\n[4] Human vs. Generative AI in Content Creation Competition: Symbiosis or Conflict?, ICML 2024\n[5] User Welfare Optimization in Recommender Systems with Competing Content Creators, KDD 2024\n[6] How Bad is Top-K Recommendation under Competing Content Creators?, ICML 2023\n[7] Doubly optimal no-regret learning in monotone games, ICML 2023"

Another practically relevant and technically interesting question is the welfare property of the learned equilibrium.

Why don't you just let the demand distribution be a continuous distribution with support being the full unit cube $[0, 1]^k$? \n\n(W2.2) Second, the number of publishers $n$ is too small (<=10). You observed that the user welfare decreases with $n$ because \"publishers adhere to their initial documents more when $n$ increases\".  However, if $n$ becomes much larger, the $n$ publishers can cover a large space in the unit cube $[0, 1]^k$, which means that the information needs of different users should be more easily satisfied.  So we might see a \"U\" curve for user welfare.  I'm afraid that your observation of \"user welfare decreasing with $n$\" is an artifact of too-small $n$ or the choice of discrete demand distribution as I said in (W2.1).\n\nIt would be nice to include some experiments with continuous distributions and a larger number of publishers."

An alternative argument to achieve this goal might be the following: Suppose the game has a unique NE $x$ (which is guaranteed under some conditions in Corollary 1).

                "value": "This paper studies the strategic behavior of content creators in an independently mediated recommendation platform from a game theoretic lens. In this setting, the goal of the any content creators is to maximize their exposure to an arriving user by the recommendation platform which uses a ranking function to map the creators\u2019 contents to a distribution over all the creators (which becomes the exposure of their content to the arriving user). The content creators strategies (i.e. the content they produce), as well as the information needs of the arriving user are modeled as vectors in the same embedding space (a common assumption in dense retrieval) endowed with some semi-metric for measuring the distance (relevance) between a creators content and the users requirement. It is further assumed that each content creator has an initial piece of content (a base vector) that they can modify to increase the exposure of this document to the arriving user by the ranking algorithm. However, it is further assumed that the creators want to maintain the integrity of their initial document - i.e. the modified document should not be too far away (in terms of the semi-metric distance) from their initial document. This is modeled by assuming that the utility of the content creator which is their exposure of their (modified) content to the user by the ranking algorithm, is further penalized (linearly) by the distance of the modified document from the original document. In this general setting, the authors aim to understand the learning dynamics of the content creators if the creators were to employ a no-regret learning algorithm for minimizing their regret (defined over their utility). \n\nIn this setting, the authors show that if the recommendation platform were to use a particular kind of a ranking function, which they term \u201cproportional ranking function\u201d, then the resultant game has several desirable properties. This proportional ranking function is a function that loosely converts the vector of distances of the content creators documents from the users information requirement into a distribution, and has a form that structurally looks like the softmax, but is more general as it allows for more general activation functions. In particular, the authors show that if the activation function within this proportional ranking function is concave, then the resultant game has a nash equilibrium, and moreover, the learning dynamics will converge to it if every player employs any regret minimization algorithm that achieves sublinear regret. \n\nThe authors validate their theoretical guarantees with simulations, experimenting with proportional ranking functions with different activation functions. They experimentally analyze the effect of several parameters within their model, such as the dimensionality of the embedding space, the penalty factor (that penalizes the distance of the modified documents from the initial document in the creators utility functions), and the number of publishers."

The exposition is very clear and it was very easy for me to follow, despite me having relatively little exposure to algorithmic game theory. I do believe this work is impactful, as it is important to understand how the content providers are going to strategize on search platforms. The way I see it, this provides some guidelines for what kind of ranking functions may be used for search ranking. That being said, this is not my primary area of research, and I will leave the judgement of novelty to other more knowledgeable reviewers."

                "value": "That biggest limitation I see with this work is the form the utility function takes: it is a linear function that is the expected exposure of the document penalized by the distance from the initial document with some penalty factor. In practice, I assume the utilities of the content creators would be some more complicated payoff structure that may not necessarily increase linearly with exposure. Do the authors have any ideas as to what the learning dynamics would look like for more general utilities that are monotone, but not necessarily linear in the exposure, or what technical barriers might be faced that might make studying this difficult?"
