    "abstract": "We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel *causal explanation formula* that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider *agent-specific effects* -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of *structure-preserving interventions* and attribute the effect to state variables based on their \"intrinsic'' contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our decomposition approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.",

However, it would be more impactful and interesting to investigate the estimands for multiple agents' actions in a multi-agent MDP, especially under varying interaction structures. Additionally, under the single-agent action setting, Theorems 3.3 and 4.2 are straightforward extensions of the causal mediation formula (Pearl, 2001) and intrinsic causal contributions (Janzing et al., 2024).\n\n**Experiment** I find the validity of conclusions such as the causal explanation formula (lines 411 and 412) questionable, given that both TCFE and tot-ASE are estimated quantities. I also find there is no experiment to demonstrate the estimation accuracy. It would be more insightful to first use simulations to assess whether the estimation algorithm accurately approximates the true values.\n\n**Assumption** The interpretation of the key assumption for identification, noise monotonicity, is unclear. A discussion on the conditions under which it is valid, and when it may not hold, would clarify its applicability. Additionally, an illustration using the sepsis example would be helpful."

The authors then decomposed the total counterfactual effect into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents\u2019 actions, called the total agent-specific effect, and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions, called the reverse state-specific effect. Building on the method of path analysis in structural causality, the authors then further decomposed the total agent-specific effect into a series of more refined agent-specific effects. Counterfactual measures based on the Shapley value are proposed to attribute the effect to each individual agent. Similarly, the authors also proposed more refined counterfactual measures, based on the notion of intrinsic causal contributions, to decompose the reverse state-specific effects. These proposed counterfactual measures could be seen as explanations evaluating the influence of underlying causal mechanisms on the difference in the observed outcome."

However, it is not clear which specific challenges of the multi-agent MDP framework are addressed that go beyond these previous works. For instance, if the primary challenge arises from the sequential decision-making nature of MDPs, it would be beneficial to further emphasize how the authors handle these complexities.\n\n2. The paper addresses the computational complexity of counterfactual effect decomposition with a large number of agents and time steps, and I appreciate the discussion in Appendix H on approximation and scalability improvements. However, the simulations in the main paper are limited to two agents. It would be informative to see how the method performs with more agents (e.g., $3$ or $5$) and how the results might differ. Additionally, has the performance of the approximation methods in Appendix H been empirically evaluated, or is it based solely on theoretical considerations? Some empirical analysis of the time-accuracy tradeoff would strengthen the discussion."

In Lines 242-250, the authors discuss connections between this work and mediation analysis in causal inference, where the total effect is typically decomposed into direct and indirect effects. In the multi-agent MDP setting, however, the total effect is expressed as a difference (rather than a sum) between the ASE and SSE. Could the authors elaborate on how this decomposition aligns with classical mediation analysis? Is the similarity primarily conceptual (i.e., decomposing into two parts), or is there a more detailed mapping between single-stage mediation analysis and the multi-agent MDP framework?\n\n2. The proposed causal explanation framework relies on counterfactual estimation under a fixed action assignment sequence, which in turn requires accurate and consistent counterfactual estimates with minimal variance. In many real-world applications involving only observational data, would it be overly challenging to apply this decomposition using off-policy evaluation methods?
