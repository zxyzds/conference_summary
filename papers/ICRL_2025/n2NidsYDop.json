    "title": "Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought",
    "abstract": "This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by \\citet{Wies23}. We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \\emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. These results rigorously show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT.",

The authors study a simple setup of k-parity problem with 1-layer Transformer and in this case provide a separation results for transformer trained without intermediate supervision and one trained with teacher forcing. They also provide positive results for the case where the transformer can generate chain-of-thought but is not explicitly supervised with the intermediate results. They show conditions which are required in this case (data augmentation and self-consistency checking)."

Through formal mathematical proofs and asymptotic complexity analysis, the authors establish three key findings: without intermediate supervision, solving k-parity with finite-precision gradient-based algorithms requires exponentially many steps, extending prior impossibility results to finite-sample settings. In contrast, with teacher forcing\u2014where ground-truth intermediate steps are provided\u2014the model efficiently learns the task in a single gradient update, underscoring the value of explicit supervision for complex reasoning. Additionally, even without teacher forcing, the model achieves accurate reasoning by employing data augmentation to validate intermediate steps, implementing a form of self-consistency check that allows for logarithmic convergence. This research emphasizes theoretical analysis through mathematical proofs and complexity analysis, offering insights into how transformers can perform chain-of-thought reasoning and task decomposition, thereby aligning with recent empirical advances in complex reasoning tasks."

The claim on the conclusion about finetuning transformer to improve multi step reasoning seems really too strong. In particular, it would be nice to show that it's easy to produce CoT data for all reasoning tasks before claiming this.
