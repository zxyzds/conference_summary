    "title": "Conformal Reasoning: Uncertainty Estimation in Interactive Environments",
    "abstract": "We introduce conformal reasoning, a principled method for models in interactive environments to reason about their uncertainty and decide whether to seek out more information or to return a prediction. The challenge with standard conformal prediction---a popular statistical framework for uncertainty estimation that constructs prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees---is that it relies on a fixed set of calibration data points. In interactive environments, however, the calibration trajectories require certain termination criteria determined a priori, introducing heuristic bias and/or circular dependency that break the assumptions needed for coverage guarantees. We address this issue by building on adaptive conformal inference techniques. On two real-world tasks on medical diagnosis and embodied question answering, we show that conformal reasoning empirically achieves its theoretical coverage guarantees---in contrast with standard conformal prediction approaches that can significantly over- or under-cover---while improving exploration efficiency by approximately 20% on both tasks.",

                "value": "(1)\nThere are fundamental and serious issues with the idea of terminating when |C| = 1, as proposed in Figure 1. To be fair, these problems appear not just in this paper, but in the prior work of Ren et al. as well. \u2028\u2028The issue is this: marginal coverage does _not_ guarantee coverage when |C|=1. The latter is a form of conditional coverage. Thus, on the termination event in Figure 1, the coverage guarantee provided by conformal prediction does _not_hold. That is, precisely on the event that the reasoning is deemed reliable (|C|=1), we cannot provide a reliability guarantee. (Formally, $\\mathbb{P}(y \\in C(x) \\mid \\|C(x)\\| = 1)$ has no guarantee.)\n\nConformal prediction methods have been developed for abstention, such as the conformal alignment algorithm of https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301, or the conformal selective classification subroutine of https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01052. Such procedures _are_ able to guarantee $\\mathbb{P}(y \\in C(x) \\mid \\|C(x)\\| = 1) \\geq 1-\\alpha$.\n\n(2)\nThe mathematical details of the paper are unclear, largely due to many typos. It is also overly formal in some sections, while being under-developed in critical parts.\n\nThe biggest issue is on page 7, where the score function is defined. We see $s(\\bar x, y) = s(x_i^{min(t_{ans},T)},y)$. But $t_{ans}$ is unknown at $t=1$; so how can we expect to construct the prediction set at time $t=1$? That is: we can obviously define any score function we would like, as a function of the whole trajectory. The harder part, at least in this multi-turn setup, is inverting the test to get a sensible prediction set. Therefore, the form of the set should be written out, as it is for the baseline at the bottom of page 5.\n\nThere are also a number of typos in the math throughout. My general suggestion would be to cut down on the amount of notation and formalism as much as possible, to reduce to the minimal amount needed to convey the ideas.\n\nMath typos:\n* Bottom of page 5, definition of sets: $C^{\\tau}$ does not seem to depend on $\\tau$ except through $x^{\\tau}$, which calls into question why it should have the second superscript.\n* in the definition of SCP on page 5, the quantile function has been defined over measures, but it takes an empirical PDF as an argument earlier (these objects are of a different type)\n* the conformal quantile isn\u2019t the 1-alpha empirical quantile, it is the$ (1-\\alpha)(1+1/n)$ empirical quantile due to the delta mass placed at infinity\n* The correct notation for a set cardinality is not $\\| \\mathcal{C} \\|$, but $|\\mathcal{C}|$ (the former is normally reserved for a norm)\n\n(3)\nThe paper could also use a more comprehensive literature review around methods for conformal prediction under feedback loops, for agents, and for decisions. There are many such papers. \n\n_______\n\nOther typos, errors, and minor suggestions:\n\n$\\|y - f(x)\\|$ is not bounded. (Conformal scores do not generally need to be bounded or non-negative.)\n\n\u201coriginally designed to handle external distribution shifts in dynamic environments\u201d not really. It was designed to handle arbitrary distribution shifts of any kind.\n\nFigure 1: right-side of the right-most panel, I think that there is an error. The algorithm shouldn\u2019t yet terminate because both A and B cross the red line, so the prediction set should be {A, B}. Maybe the bar for A should be lower.\n\n\u201cminimal prediction sets\u201d -> \u201cminimal size prediction sets\u201d\n\n\u201cWe emphasize that Theorem 1 holds for arbitrary score function\u201d typo\n\n\u201cThe main challenge of the task is for the Expert system to ask\ninformation-seeking questions to expand Kt until the the Expert system is sufficiently\u201d typo in Appendix A.\n\nOn pg. 7, why does $x_i$ appear in the definition of $s(\\bar x, y)$? This must be a typo, given the way $\\bar x$ is defined on pg 5 in terms of $x^i$.\n\nNot sure why this is called conformal reasoning. Name does not reflect the nature of the method, which can be applied to any trajectories, and does not really include reasoning as a subroutine."

To address these challenges, the authors employ adaptive conformal prediction (ACP), which dynamically adjusts the quantile value as the environment changes and relaxes the restrictive assumptions in (1). The main contribution of this paper is the application of ACP in this multi-turn context, where it demonstrates better empirical performance over SCP in the authors' experiments."
