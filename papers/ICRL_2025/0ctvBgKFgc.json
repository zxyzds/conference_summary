    "title": "ProtComposer: Compositional Protein Structure Generation with 3D Ellipsoids",
    "abstract": "We develop ProtComposer to generate protein structures conditioned on spatial protein layouts that are specified via a set of 3D ellipsoids capturing substructure shapes and semantics. At inference time, we condition on ellipsoids that are hand-constructed, extracted from existing proteins, or from a statistical model, with each option unlocking new capabilities. Hand-specifying ellipsoids enables users to control the location, size, orientation, secondary structure, and approximate shape of protein substructures. Conditioning on ellipsoids of existing proteins enables redesigning their substructure's connectivity or editing substructure properties. By conditioning on novel and diverse ellipsoid layouts from a simple statistical model, we improve protein generation with expanded Pareto frontiers between designability, novelty, and diversity. Further, this enables sampling designable proteins with a helix-fraction that matches natural proteins, unlike existing generative models that commonly oversample conceptually simple helix bundles.",

This allows the ellipsoids to be unordered set. i.e. user doesn\u2019t have to specify the order or ellipsoids; model also decides the order of ellipsoids. \n2. The formulation of ellipsoid token is effective and is easy to be extended to different conditions other than secondary structure. (such as hydrophobicity)\n3. Thorough analysis of ellipsoid consistency, including both geometric and probabilistic metrics.\n4. Fig4: The comparison on designability/diversity with baseline methods are done as comparing Pareto frontiers with varying sampling temperatures/guidances. This clearly shows the tradeoff between the methods and the performance improvement from baselines.  I found this analysis insightful and believe other papers arguing increased performance could benefit from a similar evaluation scheme.\n5. The practical use-case of the method is shown in Section4.3 flexible conditioning.\n6. The controllability is greatly improved from Chroma (Table1). Accuracy and coverage is very impressive."

Can you also present co-design designability value as in MultiFlow paper?\n\nOther than that, I did not find any major weaknesses from the paper. However, the ablation study can be improved. Most of the model ablations are based on guidance strength, but I am also curious about ablation study on (i) ellipsoid segementation cutoff (5A currently), (ii) allow residue token to update ellipsoid token or not. For (ii), explaining the reasoning behind the design choice may suffice."

Building on Multiflow\u2019s architecture, the authors address two main challenges:\n\n1. Integrating and updating ellipsoid conditioning with structure embeddings with minimal modifications: they introduced an *Invariant Cross Attention* module to update residue embeddings while preserving local SE3 invariance.\n2. Implementing an effective conditioning approach for flow-matching models: they used classifier-free guidance to interpolate flow vectors across translation, rotation, and amino acid spaces, and employ self-conditioning to refine predicted structures\n    \nExtensive experiments show that the proposed model can faithfully follow spatial conditioning, resulting in greater diversity, novelty, and improved secondary structure composition. This improves Multiflow by generating proteins with secondary structures more similar to natural proteins. \nOverall, this work presents a straightforward approach to control protein generation, enhancing Multiflow's diversity, novelty, and secondary structure accuracy."

                "value": "1. **Ellipsoid Representation**\n\n    a. Choosing the Number of Ellipsoids (k):\n    - *Training:* Is k determined by the structure of the training protein? If so, what is the distribution of k in natural proteins?\n    - *Evaluation based on the statistical model:* The authors appear to have used a fixed k=5 in the experiments. How was this number chosen? Have the authors tested other k values?\n\n    b. Number of Residues per Ellipsoid:\n    - The current representation specifies the number of residues in each ellipsoid, but the authors show that this number directly depends on ellipsoid volume. Could specifying the number of residues be redundant, and might removing this constraint provide the model more flexibility in generation? Have the authors examined the impact of residue count on amino acid (AA) prediction?\n\n2. **Invariance Cross-Attention (ICA) Layer Design**\n\n    a. The authors separately model the SE3 features (E_k) and scalar features (e_k) of ellipsoids using the proposed ICA and transformer to achieve SE3 invariance in the local frame. Has the team considered alternative approaches, such as modeling ellipsoids as \u201cpseudo frames\u201d with SE3 and scalar features and simply using IPA to update ellipsoid and residue features together?\n\n    b. In Algorithm 1:\n    - Could the authors clarify the *PosEmbed* used in line 223? Does it include distance, angles, or local coordinates?\n    - Could they also explain why the query uses un-updated $s$, while the key and value use $a$, which incorporates current ellipsoid information?\n\n3. **Results in Table 2 (natural proteins):** The model, even with the strongest guidance, tends to overestimate helices in proteins. Additionally, the authors did not present designability results, which, based on Figure 16, may be compromised with strong guidance. Could the authors elaborate on the model's performance in addressing the \u201coverrepresented helix problem,\u201d the trade-offs with other metrics, and its overall comparison to models like *RFDiffusion*?\n\n4. In self-conditioning (line 290), they propose supplying interpolated conditions to both conditional and unconditional models, suggesting this improves \u201cdesignability and ellipsoid adherence for all $\\lambda$ values.\u201d However, no ablation studies were provided to verify this claim."
