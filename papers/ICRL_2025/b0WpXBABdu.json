    "title": "Risk-Sensitive Diffusion: Robustly Optimizing Diffusion Models with Noisy Samples",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models are mainly studied on image data. However, non-image data (e.g., tabular data) are also prevalent in real applications and tend to be noisy due to some inevitable factors in the stage of data collection, degrading the generation quality of diffusion models. In this paper, we consider a novel problem setting where every collected sample is paired with a vector indicating the data quality: risk vector. This setting applies to many scenarios involving noisy data and we propose risk-sensitive SDE, a type of stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by the risk vector, to address it. With some proper coefficients, risk-sensitive SDE can minimize the negative effect of noisy samples on the optimization of diffusion models. We conduct systematic studies for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise distributions, providing analytical forms of risk-sensitive SDE. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple tabular and time-series datasets, showing that risk-sensitive SDE permits a robust optimization of diffusion models with noisy samples and significantly outperforms previous baselines.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a method called risk-sensitive SDE to improve diffusion model performance on noisy non-image data, like tabular and time-series datasets, by pairing noisy samples with risk vectors. Applying the standard diffusion process on noisy samples causes a marginal distribution shift and degrades generation quality. To mitigate this, the risk-sensitive SDE aims to minimize noise impact and improve robustness by minimizing a stability measure, termed Perturbation Instability. If perturbation stability holds\u2014which is achievable in cases where the noise distribution is Gaussian\u2014the noisy sample will have the same distribution as that of the corresponding clean sample at some iteration t in the Stability Interval and this could be used to optimize the score-based model. When this condition does not hold, the model seeks to minimize perturbation instability. The authors provide sufficient and necessary conditions for achieving perturbation stability and conduct extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of risk-sensitive SDE over baseline models in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise settings."

The effectiveness of the proposed approach heavily relies on accurate estimations of the risk vector.

The Risk-Sensitive Diffusion approach is limited to Gaussian and Cauchy noise. However, is this limitation applicable to most real world datasets?

Could you provide a brief explanation (the data being already noised, we juste use it after some noising time)\n* Lines 93 and 119 contain redundant expressions such as \u201cthe reverse process (i.e., reverse version of the diffusion process)\u201d and the entire \u201cRemark 2.1.\u201d Simplifying these would improve readability.\n* Definition 3.1: The phrase \u201cThe risk information $r$ shapes as a vector\u201d is mathematically unclear, alike the definition of the set in (4). The use of $P_{\\epsilon}$ for a family of distributions that should depend on $r$ is confusing. Furthermore, on line 172, $P_r$ is used instead of $P_{\\epsilon}$, while it still does not depend on $r$ (all isotropic centred Gaussian distributions?). This is frustrating to follow.\n* In Theorem 3.1, it would be nice to add some interpretations for the mathematics. What can we expect the stability interval to look like? Are we sure $u(t)$ or $f(t) (= u' / u)$ does not diverge at $t=0$ or on the boundary of the stability interval? What can we say about the fact that $f(r, t)$ does not depend on $r$? You can then articulate it better with Corollary 3.1, where you can focus on explaining that, essentially, a noised sample $\\Tilde{x}(0)$ can be used in the training process at the moment when the noising process would have added \"equivalent\" noise from a clean sample. Is this not a good interpretation?\n* Line 340: For non-Gaussian noise, it would be interesting to specify any required conditions on the noise distribution for the derivation of tractable expressions.\n* Experiments (Tabular Data): Given that the imputed data is noisy (lines 506-507 \"the data generated in this way will be very noisy since KNN is certainly very inaccurate.\"), it will mostly not be used to train the model, since the stability interval will be a small set around $T$. To properly assess the technique, you would need an experiment where you train a model only on the clean samples. \n* Experiments (Noisy Time Series): In the same way, we would need more information on how the interpolation is constructed, what is the kernel used for the Gaussian process, on which part of the dataset is the generative performance measured etc., so we can fully understand the performance gap. A comparison based on your customized evaluation methods, which appear designed to highlight the strengths of your approach, may not fully capture a fair performance assessment."

Generally, authors should think about/look for settings where this risk/corruption is front and center. Perhaps from vision and video domains. Or from finance - you mention applicability, but don't attempt to solve any finance-flavored problems. Perhaps volatility can proxy for noise/risk. Right now, this paper is more like a [rather elegant] solution looking for a problem it can solve."
