    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation techniques signify a pivotal advancement in creating 3D models from textual descriptions. Contemporary state-of-the-art methods utilize score distillation processes, leveraging 2D priors to generate 3D assets. However, these approaches frequently encounter instability during the initial generation phases, primarily due to an distribution divergence between the pretrained score prediction network and the nascent 3D model. Specifically, raw rendered images of an initial 3D model lie outside the distribution (OOD) of the pretrained score prediction network, which is trained on high-fidelity realistic images. To address this OOD issue, we introduce an innovative Path-Tracing Distillation (PTD) technique that refines the distillation process. Our method sequentially optimizes the 3D model using intermediate score networks that exhibit closer distributional alignment, thereby accelerating the convergence during the early stages of training. This approach not only ensures a more stable increase in CLIP similarity initially but also preserves the visual quality and diversity of the generated models. Experiments demonstrate that PTD significantly enhances both the stability and quality of text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing baselines. PTD can also be generalized to other score distillation methods.",

                "value": "This paper focuses on the enhancement of score distillation in text-to-3D generation. It begins by identifying a key limitation: images rendered from a 3D scene may diverge from the distribution learned by the pre-trained diffusion model, resulting in imprecise supervision for 3D representations. To overcome this, the paper introduces Path-Tracing Distillation, an approach that first fine-tunes the diffusion model on images rendered from a 3D scene generated by a zero-shot text-to-3D method. This fine-tuned model is then employed for score distillation. Specifically, the authors interpolate between the original and fine-tuned weights to generate intermediate score networks, ensuring a better alignment with the distribution of images rendered from partially completed 3D scenes."

                "value": "- Sections 4.1 and 4.2 appear inconsistent. The final method in Section 4.2 seems to only save the last checkpoint and interpolate parameters to generate intermediate score networks. If this is the case, the path checkpointing scheme introduced in Sec. 4.1 and Alg. 1, where checkpoints are saved at regular intervals, may be unnecessary. Additionally, it would strengthen the paper to include an experiment comparing interpolated LoRA with path checkpointing at fixed intervals.\n\n- The comparison with LucidDreamer seems not fair; currently, the proposed method benefits from initializing the 3D representation with a pre-trained generator. To ensure fairness, LucidDreamer should be evaluated using the same initialization.\n\n- The ablation studies are limited. The choice of interval score distillation is not sufficiently justified, particularly given other possible distillation methods such as SDS, VSD, and related approaches [1, 2, 3].\n\n[1] Katzir et al., Noise-free Score Distillation\n\n[2] Wang et al., SteinDreamer: Variance Reduction for Text-to-3D Score Distillation via Stein Identity\n\n[3] Wang et al., Taming Mode Collapse in Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation\n\n- Although the paper claims faster convergence in both the abstract and introduction, there is no empirical evidence provided to support this claim."

                "value": "1. In Sec. 3, the STF is considered as a more accurate score function to highlight the OOD issue with the pre-trained score network. It would be insightful to understand how incorporating rendered images from the SF3D as references in STF impacts score distillation performance.\n\n2. The motivation around addressing OOD appears to contradict prior studies [1, 2], which suggest that the pre-trained score function naturally brings OOD samples from 3D representations toward the in-domain distribution. If the diffusion model is sufficiently tuned on a well-initialized 3D structure, it may offer little effect in further improving the quality of rendered views.\n\n3. It would also be beneficial to draw a connection to VSD, where the score network is dynamically fine-tuned to align with the distribution of rendered images. Clarifying how PTD fundamentally differs from VSD would strengthen the paper. Specifically, it would be useful to explain any distinctions in methodology that set PTD apart from VSD in managing distribution shifts during score distillation.\n\n[1] Wang et al., Score Jacobian Chaining: Lifting Pretrained 2D Diffusion Models for 3D Generation\n\n[2] Katzir et al., Noise-Free Score Distillation"

SF3D is a stronger initialization, making it unclear whether the performance gain is due to the initialization or the path-tracing approach itself.\n\n- To understand the specific contribution of path-tracing, the authors should compare PTD against LucidDreamer initialized by SF3D, which would help isolate the impact of PTD from the initialization effects. \n\n- There are very few qualitative comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. More qualitative examples would provide stronger visual evidence of PTD\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Mark Boss, Zixuan Huang, Aaryaman Vasishta, and Varun Jampani.

In the first stage, a feed-forward 3D generation model initially generates the 3D content, and then rendered views are used to fine-tune the pretrained score model (diffusion).

This raises concerns about the practical significance of the proposed method. The paper lacks additional evidence, such as a user study or an anonymous demo project page, to demonstrate a clear advantage in terms of visual quality or perceptual realism.\n\n3: The rationale for using SF3D for 3D Gaussian initialization is not fully convincing. SF3D utilizes DMTet as its 3D representation, and extracting point cloud from it to initialize 3DGS seems indirect and potentially inefficient.

The quality looks similarly cartoonish as LucidDreamer and it is not clear where this is coming from. Most results look like paintings, e.g., in Fig. 1 the mouse playing a touba or the duck swimming look very oversaturated.\n- Sparse evaluation: There are only some CLIP scores provided which mainly measure text alignment from a single 2D rendered image. There are no 3D metrics used to evaluate the approach. The bare minimum is to conduct a user study as in previous works.\n- Two-stage process: Relying on a two-stage process where SF3D is used as an initialization kind of breaks the story of the paper. How does it work without that? Since the model will be mainly determined by feed-forward generation methods and now rather looks like a texture boosting method. Previous SDS methods generate assets from scratch without external models. The geometry of the final scene is basically determined by the feed-forward model SF3D, and these feed-forward models are mainly trained on synthetic data. Hence, they do not have good prompt alignment and are limited in their output which will project into this SDS line of work. The main advantage of SDS works is that they mainly use 2D priors and have much more potential for text alignment, scene complexity, and appearance quality. But this is somehow broken through using SF3D as an initialization.\n- Requirement of multiple checkpoints: In the first stage of optimization many checkpoints are saved to fit the rendered images, this provides a large overhead. I do not fully understand why this can not be done on the fly without saving a lot of model checkpoints to disk, as it also breaks continuity and introduces discretization artifacts by setting a hyperparameter of how many checkpoints are feasible to store.\n- No video results: For 3D tasks it is very important to include renderings in the form of videos for readers to judge the results. It is difficult to evaluate the method based on the paper alone."
