    "title": "G2D2: Gradient-guided Discrete Diffusion for image inverse problem solving",
    "abstract": "Recent literature has effectively utilized diffusion models trained on continuous variables as priors for solving inverse problems. Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging image-generation models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use discrete diffusion model-based priors for solving image inverse problems.",

                "value": "The authors propose a method for solving inverse problems using discrete diffusion models with gradient guidance. They utilize the Gumbel trick to relax the categorical distribution, allowing for gradient computation. Additionally, they introduce star-shaped diffusion models to address the limitations of conventional discrete diffusion models. This approach increases the probability of transitioning to the absorbing state, enabling correction of erroneous codes. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms previous continuous pixel/latent domain diffusion model-based inverse solvers in super-resolution and deblurring tasks. They also apply it to a path-following task using a generative masked motion model."

Given the availability of options to reduce computational burden, such as low-precision floating points or lighter models, the necessity of a discrete representation is not clearly justified. It would be more convincing if the proposed method demonstrated its advantages in areas where discrete representations are essential, such as language or molecular modeling. To strengthen the paper, consider the following suggestions:\n- Compare the discrete approach directly with continuous models that use low-precision or lightweight architectures.\n- Include experiments in domains where discrete representations are inherently suitable, such as text generation or molecular modeling.\n- Discuss any potential advantages of discrete representations in image domains that may not be immediately clear from the current results."

In Lines 975 to 980, the claim that the reverse transition inverts the forward process and leads to equality with $\\delta_{z_0, z_0{\\prime}}$ should be revised. While the lemma\u2019s conclusion is unaffected, replace exact equalities with equality in distribution where appropriate.\n- Line 265: $z_t \\to z_{t-1}$."

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that this is possible. Since using the usual mask-observing Markov process of discrete diffusion models makes it hard to correct for the errors arising in the earlier stages of the sampling, the authors propose to use a star-shaped diffusion, where similar to DDIM, $z_t$s are conditionally independent given $z_0$. During inference, the parameters $\\alpha$ of the variational reverse categorical distribution are optimized by balancing the prior and the likelihood, which is grounded by sound theory. Experiments are conducted on a standard FFHQ/ImageNet settings."

It would be beneficial for the authors to draw links to the continuous counterpart, especially in the construction of the sampling.\n\n4. Motion inverse problem solving is demonstrated without any comparison.\n\n5. It is discussed that G2D2 can be used with MaskGIT, which is one of the main strength of the work.
