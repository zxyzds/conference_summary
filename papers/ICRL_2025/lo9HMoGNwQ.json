    "title": "Towards Interpretable, Sequential Multiple Instance Learning: An Application to Clinical Imaging",
    "abstract": "This work introduces the Sequential Multiple Instance Learning (SMIL) framework, addressing the challenge of interpreting sequential, variable-length sequences of medical images with a single diagnostic label. Diverging from traditional MIL approaches that treat image sequences as unordered sets, SMIL systematically integrates the sequential nature of clinical imaging. We develop a bidirectional Transformer architecture, BiSMIL, that optimizes for both early and final prediction accuracies through a novel training procedure to balance diagnostic accuracy with operational efficiency. We evaluate BiSMIL on three medical image datasets to demonstrate that it simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art final accuracy and superior performance in early prediction accuracy, requiring 30-50% fewer images for a similar level of performance compared to existing models. Additionally, we introduce SMILU, an interpretable uncertainty metric that outperforms traditional metrics in identifying challenging instances.",

The assumptions behind the proposed model are not always clear, and the paper does not motivate how the sequential component of the method would work in practice.\n\n1. The Introduction is fairly vague on what the \"sequence\" actually means: \"each image study often contains multiple number of image instances\". Does this mean a longitudinal study, or a single visit with multiple images? The context and practical application of the method remain unclear until the experiments.\n\n2. The vague definition of a \"sequence\" makes it difficult to determine why the sequential structure would be better than a simple bag-of-instances approach. For the ultrasound: what does it mean for an instance to be earlier or later in the sequence? How were these scans obtained? Is there a given order in which these scans are usually made?\n\n3. The arguments seem somewhat contradictory: on the one hand the paper claims that the sequence is important (we should use a sequence-aware method), but on the other hand the paper claims that we need a bidirectional method \"to be robust to sequence reversals\". For a CT scan, if it doesn't matter if we look from top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top, doesn't this suggest the sequence might be less important?\n\n4. How does the subsequence approach work for CT scans? Isn't this very dependent on where the object of interest (i.e., the brain hemorrhage or pulmonary condition) appears in the scan? I don't really follow how the incremental prediction and uncertainty make sense here. If you only look at the subsequence without the object of interest, you'll find a completely different label.\n\n5. The paper suggests that the method can be used to \"terminate the imaging sequence\" in order to \"improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiation exposure\". How would this work in practice? I might see how this could work for ultrasound (but this could be explained better: what does the \"sequence\" mean here? do the results depend on this order?), but for CT I find this a difficult claim. Usually, we make a single scan that collects all slices at the same time: you don't scan a few slices, analyse those, then \"decide to stop or continue scanning\".\n\nFinally, the results are not compared with non-MIL methods for these datasets. Is the performance somewhat competitive? Do we really need a complex transformer for these tasks, or could we simply use a 3D convolutional network to classify these CT scans?"

                "value": "Suggestions:\n\n* Title/Text\n\n  The title and parts of the paper refer to \"clinical imaging\". Isn't \"medical imaging\" a more commonly used term?\n\n* Page #2 (Introduction):\n\n  > is able to better capture difficult-toclassify, uncertain instances better\n\n  Grammar: better ... better\n\n* Page #3 (Sequential Multiple Instance Learning):\n\n  > To further illustrate this concept, in Figure 2, we showcase the incremental prediction results\n\n  I think this is supposed to refer to Figure 1? (See also the other references to Figure 2 in this section.)\n\n* Page #4 (The BiSMIL Model and Training Process):\n\n  > This is because scanning direction is usually a preference based on a particular clinician, and therefore we design our model to be robust to sequence reversals.\n\n  What does this mean? Does this mean that the sequence of images might be presented in the reverse order, and that therefore the model should be direction invariant? If that is the case, can we trust the relative position of the scans, or is this also based on the clinician's preference?\n\n* Page #6 (Dispersion and Sequence-Based Uncertainty):\n\n  > Intuitively, if a sequence's incremental predictions quickly converge to 0 or 1, the model is more certain about that sequence. Conversely, if the predictions fluctuate significantly, the model is likely to be less certain about the predictions.\n\n  I don't fully understand how this works with the bidirectional approach. Does this mean that if a sequence \"converges\" to 1, the same sequence in the reverse direction would converge to 0?\n\n* Page #7 (Experiments):\n\n  > For all of our experiments, we designated 70% of the data for training\n\n  What does \"the data\" mean here? Samples? Scans? Images? Slices? Patients? I assume this is patients, but it would be good to make this more explicit.\n\n  (If the data is not split on the patient level, this is something that would have to be fixed.)\n\n* Page #7 (Experiments):\n> UTD Classification Dataset\n\nWhat is the nature of the sequence in these ultrasound scans? How are these scans generally made? What does it mean for an image to be early or late in the sequence?\n\n* Page #7 (Experiments):\n\n  > 50,862 brain CT slices\n\n  What is the \"sequence\" for CT scans? Considering each \"slice\" as a separate step in the sequence would not make sense for me: the number of slices in a scan is determined before the scan is made, so the slice-by-slice MIL approach seems weird. I also find it difficult to see how this would work: would you order the slices from top to bottom, or would they appear in a random order in the sequence? If the order is sequential top-to-bottom, the ideal point to stop scanning would be the point where you first observe the hemorrhage, but how would that be done in practice?\n\n* Page #8 (Final Prediction Accuracy):\n\n  > which suggests that bidirectionality provides extra information that can improve the effectiveness of the model.\n\n  In CT scans, this would mean that the slice direction is reversed. Does this cover a practical use case? Isn't the scanning direction usually given in the DICOM headers of the scan? (Or trivially determined from the image if this is not given?)\n\n* Page #8 (Subsequence Prediction Accuracy):\n\n  > To further understand the performance of our BiSMIL model, we compare the accuracy of the BiSMIL model against the three comparison models when only a subsequence of instances are revealed.\n\n  How does this experiment work? Is this a random subset of the instances? How would this work in practice? (E.g., how do you make a random subset of CT slices?) Or is this a regular subsampling of the sequence, e.g., by taking every nth slice?"

                "value": "1. Motivation of the study:\n\n1.1 The paper justifies the development of SMIL by stating, \"In many clinical imaging settings, clinicians create images sequentially to discover features of interest and often have control over the number of sequential images captured.\" However, it would strengthen the motivation if a specific clinical setting were described to show where this statement holds true and where the proposed method could be beneficial, since for many clinical protocols are predefined, with standardized imaging procedures. Applying the proposed method in such settings could be challenging, as it would require modifications to existing protocols.\n\n1.2. Similar to above, the paper motivate the value of the proposed method by saying \"as the clinician creates more images, the resulting diagnostic accuracy is likely to increase, but it comes at the expense of efficiency and patient radiation exposure.\" However, not all medical imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, involve radiation exposure. Moreover, it would be valuable to clarify the potential practical efficiency gains that reduce only a few images brings.\n\n2. Method Novelty\n\nThe use of a bidirectional architecture for modeling sequence data is a well-established technique. For example, bi-directional models, such as Bi-LSTMs, have long been employed in various contexts to model sequential information.\n\n3. The model is not really doing ``incremental'' prediction. In the inference setting, when the clinician collected a sequence m_1 = {x_1, ..., x_n}, the model generates a prediction p1, when the clinician capture one more image m_2 = {x_1, .., x_n, x_(n+1)}, the model basically treat this as brand new sequence and evaluate again to generate p2. This procedure can be applied with other Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) methods as well."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. It is fine that the author try to relax the classic MIL assumption to incorporate sequence information in real clinical practice. However, it is unclear what specific sequential information the proposed model aims to capture, particularly as the authors also noted that sequence order can sometimes depend on the clinician\u2019s or operator\u2019s preference.\n\n2. In line 194 \"the Gaussian embedding is designed to encourage robustness in the reverse sequence\". Can you elaborate on this? How does the Gaussian position encoding encourage robustness in the reverse sequence? What about for the forward sequence?\n\n3. It is unclear how the model would inform clinicians about the optimal stopping point for image collection. Given a full sequence (like those experiments in the paper), we can determine the ideal stopping point, but in a real-world setting, where an additional image has not yet been collected, we do not know if additional image would contribute valuable information.\n\n4. As the author noted, training on subsequences with the label of the full sequence may introduce noise. To address this, they use a heuristic that assigns lower weights to shorter subsequences. However, this may still introduce noise. It is unclear how effectively this approach reduces noise, and it would be helpful to understand if this training objective (e.g., removing the second part in line 244) significantly improves model performance."
