    "title": "MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging $\\textit{cross-corruption}$ scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation. The source code is provided in the supplementary materials.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach for test-time adaptation in LiDAR-based 3D object detection: Model Synergy (MOS). The proposed method dynamically selects and assembles historical checkpoints to create a composite \"super model\" that adapts to domain shifts, including cross-dataset and corruption shifts. The assembly of checkpoints is controlled by Synergy Weights (SW) module, which minimizes redundancy by leveraging output-level and feature-level similarities. The method addresses practical scenarios like cross-corruption shifts, where both dataset and environmental discrepancies occur simultaneously. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including KITTI, Waymo, and KITTI-C, demonstrate that MOS outperforms SOTA test-time adaptation methods, achieving considerable improvements in both standard and complex scenarios."

The paper demonstrates strong results (outperforms the SOTA methods) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection but does not extend its findings to other modalities or sensors. I'm interested in whether MOS can generalize to other types of data, such as inputs combining LiDAR point clouds and camera images.\n2. While the paper contains empirical results for the chosen similarity metrics, more theoretical analysis for determining the synergy weights could be more thoroughly discussed.\n3. It would be better if the authors could provide more clarity on how checkpoints are selected and what \"unique insights\" would improve understanding of the model selection process, I may not quite follow what's the insights here.\n4. The rank-based feature-level and output-level similarity functions calculate the inverse Gram matrix, this method is novel but seems to be computational heavily. The paper provides some analysis of the MOS method in the last section, but it'll be great to have more discussion on how these similarity metrics scale with larger datasets or different types of models."
