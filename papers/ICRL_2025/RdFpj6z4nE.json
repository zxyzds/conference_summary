    "title": "Neural Symbolic Regression of Complex Network Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Complex networks describe important structures in nature and society, composed of nodes and the edges that connect them. The evolution of these networks is typically described by dynamics, which are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge to derive. However, because the complex network involves noisy observations from multiple trajectories of nodes, existing symbolic regression methods are either not applicable or ineffective on its dynamics. In this paper, we propose Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics Symbolic Regression (PI-NDSR), a method based on neural networks and genetic programming to automatically learn the symbolic expression of dynamics. Our method consists of two key components: a Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics (PIND) to augment and denoise trajectories through observed trajectory interpolation; and a coordinated genetic search algorithm to derive symbolic expressions. This algorithm leverages references of node dynamics and edge dynamics from neural dynamics to avoid overfitted expressions in symbolic space. We evaluate our method on synthetic datasets generated by various dynamics and real datasets on disease spreading. The results demonstrate that PI-NDSR outperforms the existing method in terms of both recovery probability and error.",

PI-NDSR features two main innovations: (1) a neural dynamics module (PIND) that interpolates and denoises the observed data to generate dense, low-noise trajectories, thereby avoiding the instability of directly modeling derivatives; and (2) a coordinated genetic search algorithm that uses neural dynamics as a reference to guide symbolic regression of node and edge dynamics separately, preventing overfitting and improving search efficiency.

However, interpolation fundamentally relies on existing observed data, meaning that any missing information between observation points could still lead to deviations from the true dynamics. Particularly in cases of high data sparsity, interpolation methods may produce overly smooth results, potentially missing critical dynamic variations. Thus, interpolation alone may not fully resolve the information loss caused by sparsity, as its effectiveness remains dependent on the quality and density of the original data. This could be further addressed by exploring additional complementary data sources or methods that can better capture system dynamics under sparse conditions.\n\n2. **Unclear Motivation in the Paper\u2019s Methodology**\n   - The paper highlights challenges in symbolic regression for complex network dynamics, such as noise, data sparsity, and the need for decoupling node and edge dynamics. However, it does not fully explain the specific reasons and impacts of these challenges. In particular, the motivation for decoupling node and edge dynamics lacks sufficient detail, making it difficult for readers to understand why this decoupling is critical to obtaining high-quality symbolic expressions. Simply mentioning that \"traditional methods tend to lead to overfitting in symbolic space\" is somewhat vague and lacks specific examples or theoretical support. Clarifying the distinct roles of node and edge dynamics in symbolic expressions, and why decoupling is necessary for accurate representation, would enhance the paper's persuasiveness."

                "value": "1. The innovation of the method in the article is limited. First, the use of neural networks to fit data in order to enhance symbolic regression performance has been widely adopted in many works. For instance, in AI-Feynman[1], a neural network is first used to fit the data, and then the fitted data is analyzed to infer the nature of the equation, which facilitates subsequent symbolic regression. Similarly, this paper also uses a neural network to fit data to avoid inaccuracies in derivative estimation caused by sparse or noisy observational data. Essentially, both approaches leverage the generalization capability of neural networks to mitigate the negative impact of sparse data points. Second, using surrogate models for symbolic regression is also a common approach. For example, SymDL [2], like this paper, uses an MLP locally as a surrogate model for node dynamics G and edge dynamics F.  \n2. The experiments in the article are not sufficiently comprehensive; they are limited to relatively simple dynamical scenarios and have not been applied to more complex scenarios such as neuronal, genetic, social, and coupled oscillator dynamics. Moreover, the experiments are restricted to one-dimensional data, while many other works, like TP-SINDy, can handle higher-dimensional data. For example, the FHN dynamics is a higher-order network equation, and this paper does not include experimental discussion on this equation.  \n\n\nReferences:  \n[1] Silviu-Marian Udrescu, Max Tegmark ,AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression.Sci.
