    "title": "Mitigating Embedding Collapse in Diffusion Models for Categorical Data",
    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models have enabled continuous-state diffusion models to handle a variety of datasets, including categorical data. However, most methods rely on fixed pretrained embeddings, limiting the benefits of joint training with the diffusion model. While jointly learning the embedding (via reconstruction loss) and the latent diffusion model (via score matching loss) could enhance performance, our analysis shows that end-to-end training risks embedding collapse, degrading generation quality. To address this issue, we introduce CATDM, a continuous diffusion framework within the embedding space that stabilizes training. We propose a novel objective combining the joint embedding-diffusion variational lower bound with a Consistency-Matching (CM) regularizer, alongside a shifted cosine noise schedule and random dropping strategy. The CM regularizer ensures the recovery of the true data distribution. Experiments on benchmarks show that CATDM mitigates embedding collapse, yielding superior results on FFHQ, LSUN Churches, and LSUN Bedrooms. In particular, CATDM achieves an FID of 6.81 on ImageNet $256\\times256$ with 50 steps. It outperforms non-autoregressive models in machine translation and is on a par with previous methods in text generation.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a connection in continuous-space diffusion models between simultaneously optimizing  the reconstruction of discrete data embeddings and ensuring the consistency of cross entropy denoising on one hand, and optimizing the cross entropy denosing on the other.  The former two objectives are added to the usual diffusion model loss with the goal of preventing embedding collapse. To this end additional measures are taken, such as changing the noising schedule, re-weighting the three objectives in the loss and applying random dropping. Then the proposed model is applied to image generation, text generation, and machine translation."

                "value": "1) Proposition 2 (and therefore the proof of Theorem 1) appears to be incorrect. More precisely, the conclusion in line 922 (appendix) is not true. If at $z_t$ (perturbed from $emb(x)$) the model predicts the one hot encoding for a particular token $x_i$ at position $i$ of the preperturbed sequence $x$, then this prediction will be incorrect for all other sequences $y$ that generate $z_t$, and that coincide with x in all but position $i$. The true optimal model is the ground truth $p_{0|t}(x^i|z_t)$. That is, loss $L_{CE}=-E_{p(x)}E_{p(z_t|x)}\\sum_{i=1}^M \\log{p^{\\theta}_{0|t}(x^0_i=x_i|z_t)}$ is minimized when \n\n$p^\\theta_{0|t}(x_i|z_t)=p_{0|t}(x_i|z_t)$. In this case $L_{CE} = \\sum_{i=1}^M E_{p(z_t)}H(p^{\\theta}_{0|t}(x_i|z_t))>0.$ I would be grateful if the authors could discuss this.\n\n2) Assuming the correctness of proposition 2: The paper proposes only that optimizing the two objectives ($ L_{CM} $ and $L_0$,) optimizes the latter $L_{CE}$ . However, using the same arguments, the other direction should hold as well, as indeed having a perfect denoising cross entropy loss, the same arguments imply perfect reconstruction at time $t=0$, and since the model predicts the correct unperturbed token (for each position) at each time point, then such predictions will be constant (consistent). As such it is difficult to see why one should use these two more convoluted objectives instead of just using denoising cross entropy which itself mitigates embedding collapse. In addition, then $\\mathcal{L}_{DM}$ is added which theoretically is not necessary (according to Theorem 1), and in practice introduces the issue of embedding collapse with its $L_2$ loss. So my question is why not simply use the denoising cross entropy alone as in Dieleman et al. 2022? It is essential to compare the proposed method against the pure denosing cross entropy loss on the same task using the same model. \n\n3) The paper applies the method mostly to inherently continuous data (which is quantized), while the title and premise of the paper imply improving the modeling of categorical data. It would have been better to focus more on text or protein design. However, the experiments on text are very limited, testing only on text8 at character level, where they underperform in comparison to categorical diffusion models. On machine translation the results are better but the paper does not provide results for SEDD of Lou et al 2023 in this case. \n\n4) Benchmark models for continuous data are not recent. Most recent models have FIDs under 2, but the proposed model shows a FID of 6.81.\n\n**Minor Issues**\n\nIn line 108, shouldn't it be *backward* process?\n\nLine 124: it is a bit confusing stating element $i$, as this normally means dimension $i$ of a vector. However in this context we are referring to the embedding at position $i$ in the sequence embedding.\n\nExpression in 240, does not really coincide with consistency models of Song et al 2023. Their models are discrete in time, the continuous version has a different form (see Remark 10 in the appendix of their paper). In their loss only times $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$ appear, and not non-neighbor times."

How is it implemented in practice? A detailed algorithm would be very helpful.\n\nAssuming the correctness of proposition 2: My main question is why use $ L_{CM} $ and $L_0$, instead of  $L_{CE}$ alone? Then why also add  $L_{DM}$? I understand that the paper starts from diffusion models, but once $ L_{CM} $ and $L_0$ are added, theoretically (as it is shown in Theorem 1) they should be enough to learn the paths without adding $L_{DM}$. I would be grateful if authors could add another row in Table 1, where only $ L_{CM} $ + $L_0$ is used."

You mentioned that all results, except for Difformer and CATDM, were taken from previous studies. However, for example, according to [1], SeqDiffuSeq's BLEU scores for WMT14 EN-DE and IWSLT14 DE-EN are significantly higher than the ones you reported, for WMT14 EN-DE, it is 19.76(ScareBLEU)/24.24(Tokenized BLEU) in [1] vs. 14.37 that you reported. Could you clarify the reason for this discrepancy?\n3)\tIn your paper, you did not include comparisons with other relevant diffusion-based models. For example, [2] achieved 24.62 SacreBLEU on WMT14 EN-DE and 31.44 SacreBLEU on IWSLT14 DE-EN without using knowledge distillation (with Length Beam=10, MBR=5).\n4)\tCould you specify which type of BLEU score you are reporting\u2014whether it is tokenized BLEU or SacreBLEU? Additionally, please clarify the decoding parameters used in your experiments (e.g., beam size, minimal Bayes risk, etc., if applicable). How were these parameters chosen for the baselines you compared against?

If possible, please provide precise references (for example, indicating specific tables or sections in the paper). Currently, this information is missing, making it challenging to verify the claims made in the paper.\n6)\tBased on the current results, we find that the overall performance of CATDM appears relatively weak compared to other works, both in machine translation and Text8 benchmarks. Even if knowledge distillation was not used, it seems inaccurate to claim that CATDM achieves the best results among non-autoregressive models considering models like CMLM or many other models.\n7)\tThe presentation of results for DE-EN and EN-DE in the figures and tables could be improved for clarity. Although they are labeled below the figures, it might still give the impression that these are two translation directions for the same dataset, which could confuse readers.
