    "title": "Instance-level Consistent Graph With Unsupervised Human Parts for Person Re-identification",
    "abstract": "The representation of human parts plays a crucial role in person re-identification (re-ID) by offering discriminative cues, yet it presents challenges such as misalignment, occlusion, and extreme illumination. Previous methods have primarily focused on achieving strict part-level consistency. However, individual part features change inevitably under harsh conditions, hindering consistent representation. In this article, we propose an Instance-level Consistent Graph (ICG) framework to address this issue, which extracts structural information by introducing graph modeling atop unsupervised human parts. Firstly, we introduce an attention-based foreground separation to suppress non-instance noise. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering method is designed to segment pixel-wise human parts within the foreground, enabling fine-grained part representations. We propose a flexible structure graph that derives instance-level structure from part features, treating each part feature as a node in a graph convolutional network. In essence, ICG mitigates incompleteness through feature flow among nodes, broadening the matching condition from strict part-level consistency to robust instance-level consistency. Extensive experiments on three popular person re-ID datasets demonstrate that ICG surpasses most state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting remarkable improvements over the baseline.",

While the integration of these components is practical, it does not present significant methodological advancement. \n\n2 The use of basic K-means clustering and standard GCN architecture appears dated compared to recent developments in self-attention mechanisms, advanced clustering techniques, and modern graph learning approaches. The paper would benefit substantially from incorporating more contemporary methodologies and providing stronger theoretical justification for the chosen approach.\n\n3 The paper lacks comprehensive analysis in several crucial aspects. The absence of detailed ablation studies makes it difficult to understand the relative importance of each component. The computational complexity and runtime performance considerations are not adequately addressed, which are crucial factors for practical deployment. The robustness of the clustering approach to different parameters and varying environmental conditions needs more thorough investigation."

While the paper demonstrates strong performance on the three major datasets, it lacks a discussion on the generalizability of the ICG framework to other datasets or scenarios with different characteristics. Adding experiments on more diverse datasets could strengthen the paper's claims. The computational complexity of the ICG framework is not discussed.\n\n2. The paper could improve by providing a more in-depth discussion on the limitations of the ICG framework. For instance, are there specific scenarios or types of occlusion where the method underperforms? \n\n3. The paper could address potential ethical considerations and biases in the proposed system, especially since person re-identification has implications for privacy and surveillance. Discussing how the model handles different demographic groups and mitigating bias would be an important addition.\n\n4. The typesetting of this paper seems unreasonable, and the content is not rich enough. For example, Figure 2 is placed at the bottom of the page, while Table 1 exceeds the width of the page. Also, this paper seems like it should further discuss additional experiments and ethical issues in an appendix, but it does not provide one.\n\n5. Based on the current version of the paper, it seems that the paper is difficult to replicate due to a lack of sufficient detail.\n\nIn summary, while the paper makes some contributions to the field of person re-identification, there are areas where it could be improved. Addressing these weaknesses would not only strengthen the paper's claims but also provide a clearer path for future research and practical implementation."
