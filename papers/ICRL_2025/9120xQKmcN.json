    "title": "Improving Antibody Design with Force-Guided Sampling in Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Antibodies, crucial for immune defense, primarily rely on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to bind and neutralize antigens, such as viruses. The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.",

Improving this process can have important implications in drug discovery. The main original contribution of the paper is DiffForce - an model and algorithm which allows for guidance of the generation process with differentiable implementation of force field thus potentially allowing to skew the samples towards more physically plausible conformations."

The paper has strong and general claims on \"improving antibody design\" and offering \"enhanced quality of produced antibody sequences\" but the results focus mostly on improvements of binding energies (estimated with the orthogonal, non-differentiable Rosetta force field). Sequence recovery and RMSD metrics are valuable metrics too but their interpretation is not as straightforward as higher / lower, respectively, equals better."

                "value": "In all, I believe that the manuscript is a strong starting point and an interesting contribution but authors should showcase more relevant benchmarks on the properties of generated sequences. Force fields have their own limitations, as authors correctly identify in the paper, and skewing the generation towards low energy samples can exploit their weaknesses and collapse into generating spurious examples of low quality. The results presented in Fig 3 and Fig 5 are to some extent anecdotal beyond improvement in estimated energies. With the low number of samples and even with the trained structural eye it is impossible to assess the extent of improvement.\nThe relevant literature contains multiple examples of benchmarking that could strengthen the conclusions shown in manuscript. In particular, I would welcome the orthogonal benchmarks including comparison of scores like structural fit analysis (e.g. through packing scores implemented in Rosetta), relevant properties of generated structures / sequences (like hydrophobicity, charge distributions which can assess whether model collapses to unrealistic, deteriorated samples), repeated patterns in sequences, likelihood of samples according to the LM etc."

In table 1, it would be helpful to include standard deviation for each metric, to understand the statistical significance of these results, especially as numbers are given to 2 or 3 decimal points.\nThough the incorporation of force field is very interesting, it is not completely novel and the experiments shown in this article are not completely convincing that this leads to significant and robust improvements in output quality."

                "value": "The authors focus on improvement to the binding affinity of generated antibodies, but the guiding force field is optimising for stability and overall energy rather than purely binding. Could the authors comment on how much the total energy of the protein/antibody improves when sampling with their guiding strategy, and whether this has other desirable properties, such as reducing the need for post-processing/relaxation?\n\nIn Algorithm 1, two hyperparameters are introduced that control the magnitude of the force applied during sampling. In the following section 4.2 and 4.3, a specific value is taken for both of these parameters, without a discussion of the tradeoff or impact of taking higher or lower coefficients. Could a discussion be added to expand on how table 1 would change for different parameter choices? There is a brief discussion in Appendix G, but it would be useful to provide a more qualitative understanding.\n\nIn Figure 4, it seems that the choice of when to apply the force field (at 70% in their experiments) plays an important role in changes to the output quality. Would starting the force field earlier in the sampling, or with a higher coefficient, substantially modify the results shown in this figure?"
