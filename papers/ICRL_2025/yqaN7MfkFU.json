    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a variable selection method based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to effectively identify important variables that contribute to distributional differences between two samples. We begin by assigning weights to each variable and then optimizing these weights within a regularized MMD framework. The optimized weights serve as an importance measure for each variable and can be leveraged for variable selection. Additionally, using the optimized weights, we design two algorithms aimed at enhancing test power and improving classification accuracy for two-sample tests and classification problems. Our method is model-free and makes no assumptions about the underlying structure of the data. Moreover, we propose an acceleration method to improve computational efficiency.\nWe also provide theoretical guarantees, including the consistency of the estimated weights and the convergence of our acceleration algorithms. Through numerical simulations and real-world datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method to comparing methods."

                "value": "The proposed method finds the importance levels of variables by optimizing a weighted version of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). The objective function to minimize is negative weighted MMD plus a regularization term that imposes all variable weights to be $1$ when its parameter $\\lambda$ is set to be infinitely large. The regularization parameter $\\lambda$ is chosen through optimizing the performance of the task - two-sample test or classification. An approximate version of this method is presented to reduce the computational cost, obtained through a first-order Taylor expansion of the objective function. Consistency and convergence results are given for the solution of the approximate method. Experiments on two synthetic data sets and one gene expression data set show the advantage of the proposed method over the unweighted MMD for two-sample test, and the variable selection method by Lasso for classification."

Traditionally, people calculate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between two distributions, and then perform test using MMD, namely reject the hypothesis that two distributions are identical if MMD exceeds a critical value. The authors observe that, unimportant variables may even hurt the performance of this MMD test. Therefore they proposed the weighted MMD, namely assign a weight to each variable. The optimal weights are chosen so that the weighted MMD is maximized. Variable selection can be done using these weights, facilitating the downstream two-sample test or binary classification. The authors also provide an optimization method with theoretical guarantee. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

So why does the author prefer $\\ell_2$ instead of $\\ell_1$ regularization?\n2. For the evaluation of $\\ell(\\lambda)$ in Eq.(4) or Eq. (5), it involves the sample estimate of certain objective. So which type of data is utilized? The training data $\\mathfrak{X}^{Tr}$ or testing data $\\mathfrak{X}^{Te}$, or we need to perform training-validation split on $\\mathfrak{X}^{Tr}$ and then utilize train-train data?\n3. In the Algorithm the authors proposed to solve the optimization problem (3), which is unfortunately a non-convx problem in weight $\\textbf{w}$. Then the authors resort to solve approximation optimization problem (6). What is the optimality gap between these? It is difficult for me to convince the effectiveness of this approximation algorithm.\n4.
