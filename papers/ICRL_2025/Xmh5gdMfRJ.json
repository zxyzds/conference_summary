    "title": "TSC-Net: Predict Pedestrian Trajectory by Trajectory-Scene-Cell Classification",
    "abstract": "To predict future trajectories of pedestrians, scene is as important as the history trajectory since i) scene reflects the position of possible goals of the pedestrian ii) trajectories are affected by the semantic information of the scene. It requires the model to capture scene information and learn the relation between scenes and trajectories. However, existing methods either apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to summarize the scene to a feature vector, which raises the feature misalignment issue, or convert trajectory to heatmaps to align with the scene map, which ignores the interactions among different pedestrians. In this work, we introduce the trajectory-scene-cell feature to represent both trajectories and scenes in one feature space. By decoupling the trajectory in temporal domain and the scene in spatial domain, trajectory feature and scene feature are re-organized in different types of cell feature, which well aligns trajectory and scene, and allows the framework to model both human-human and human-scene interactions. Moreover, the Trajectory-Scene-Cell Network (TSC-Net) with new trajectory prediction manner is proposed, where both goal and intermediate positions of the trajectory are predict by cell classification and offset regression. Comparative experiments show that TSC-Net achieves the SOTA performance on several datasets with most of the metrics. Especially for the goal estimation, TSC-Net is demonstrated better on predicting goals for trajectories with irregular speed.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel framework, TSC-Net, with an innovative Trajectory-Scene-Cell (TSC) feature representation designed for pedestrian trajectory prediction.  In particular, it effectively captures both individual pedestrian behavior and the contextual scene information. By decoupling trajectory data in the temporal domain and scene information in the spatial domain, the model effectively captures both human-human interactions and human-scene dynamics, leading to improved prediction accuracy compared to existing methods. The experiments conducted on various datasets seem to validate the efficacy of the proposed method."

Such a joint feature allows for better modeling of both human-human and human-scene interactions.\n\n+ The authors reformulate the trajectory prediction task as a classification problem by estimating the likelihood of each cell containing the goal or the next steps, which distinguish the proposed methods from the existing regression-based trajectory prediction.\n\n+ Extensive experimentation across multiple datasets, i.e., SDD and ETH-UCY, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of TSC-Net. Such a clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods strongly demonstrate the model's efficacy."

It would be beneficial to include more recent papers.\n* If the authors claim that the ETH-UCY dataset only contains binary-level semantics, why not experiment with vehicle trajectory datasets instead? Vehicle datasets offer richer semantic scene information, such as lanes, road edges, and traffic lights, so it seems more convincing to conduct experiments on vehicle datasets for claiming effective use of scene information. Moreover, numerous methods already proposed how to effectively utilize these scene information:\n    - HiVT (CVPR, 2022): It proposes an integrated hierarchical transformer structure using both scene and trajectory vectors.\n    - Leveraging Future Relationship Reasoning for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (ICLR, 2023): It models agent interactions using vectorized scene information.\n    - Apart from these vectorized methods, many models also use image features. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in vehicle scenarios by leveraging scene information would be more convincing.\n* The CVAE-based trajectory decoder for goal prediction does not seem new. The sequential prediction of goals and trajectories has been widely explored. For instance, Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Conditioned on Lane-Graph Traversals (CoRL, 2022) presents a more sophisticated approach with predictions conditioned on traversals.\n* The ablation study sounds insufficient. It is hard to verify the effectiveness of the proposed TSC. There is only one ablation experiments, but it is hard to see where the performance gain came from (from the proposed methods or finetuning hyperprameters). For example, it is necessary to observe how prediction performance changes when certain features ($z_{i,t}^{(sc)}$ or $a_{i,t,j,k}^{(step)}$) are excluded.\n* There are other methods with better performance on the ETH-UCY dataset, making it difficult to claim state-of-the-art performance based on average metrics.\n    - View Vertically (ECCV, 2022): 0.18/0.28"
