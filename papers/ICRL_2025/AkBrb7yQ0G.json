    "title": "Periodic Materials Generation using Text-Guided Joint Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "Equivariant diffusion models have emerged as the prevailing approach for generating novel crystal materials due to their ability to leverage the physical symmetries of periodic material structures. However, current models do not effectively learn the joint distribution of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters of the crystal material in a cohesive end-to-end diffusion framework. Also, none of these models work under realistic setups, where users specify the desired characteristics that the generated structures must match. In this work, we introduce TGDMat, a novel text-guided diffusion model designed for 3D periodic material generation. Our approach integrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each denoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice parameters using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network. Through extensive experiments with popular datasets on benchmark tasks, we first demonstrate that integrating textual knowledge significantly improves the material generation capabilities of existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we show that TGDMat surpasses text-guided variants of existing baseline methods by a substantial margin, highlighting the effectiveness of our joint diffusion paradigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall training and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative performance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.",

                "value": "This paper presents TGDMat, a novel text-guided diffusion model for generating periodic crystal materials. TDGMat jointly models the generation of atom types, coordinates, and lattices of materials using separate diffusion processes. Specifically, it uses a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for lattice modeling, and uses a discrete diffusion model D3PM for modeling atom types. As for atom coordinate modeling, the authors mainly follow DiffCSP and use a score matching objective. Note that, they apply diffusion on fractional coordinates, instead of Cartisian coordinates, which cannot reflect the periodicity of crystal materials. To ensure geometric symmetry, TGDMat uses the CSPNet proposed by DiffCSP, which ensures periodic E(3) invariance for periodic crystals.\n\nFor the text-guided component, material descriptions are generated using Robocrystallographer software. Text embeddings, produced by a language model, are then concatenated with node embeddings to guide material generation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Motivation should be clarified: (a) Providing guidance in diffusion models for improved generation is important, but it is unclear why text must be used to incorporate such guidance. The guidance information in line 70 could also be modeled as feature vectors, reducing the need for text embedding models, which may not always provide accurate text-based embeddings. Additionally, text-based models may struggle to capture subtle numerical differences. Is there any prior work on using feature vectors for guidance? What are the advantages of using text rather than directly using numerical values or feature vectors? (b) The idea of studying joint diffusion over all three components of crystal structures: the lattices, atom types, and coordinates, by employing a periodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, kind of the same as the DiffCSP. Though exploring both crystal structure prediction (CSP) and random generation task (Gen), the text guided denoising network seems to be straightforward by further considering the CSP model architecture. It is not clear how much of this part of work is based on previous research and what is new. \n\n- Method design should have rationales: The authors applied the diffusion process independently to three variables: lattice (line 210), atom types (line 248), and atom coordinates (line 272). However, in the reverse process, the denoising models use all variables with conditions for noise estimation (line 289). Given that lattice noise is independent of atom types/coordinates and vice versa, is there a reason for not simply using the lattice variable (plus $C_p$) for lattice denoising?\n\n- Experiments should be improved: The paper lacks an evaluation of whether the generated materials meet the text descriptions. Coverage may reflect this to some extent, but it is too general and lacks details on specific properties mentioned in the descriptions. Property statistics are at the distribution level between two sets and lack point-to-point comparisons. Also, the paper lacks the ablation study for the denoising model to demonstrate the individual importance of each component (or the authors could highlight the part if I missed it)."

Also, are the diffusion and reverse processes in Figure 2 are correct?\n- The paper conducts joint diffusion on lattices, atom types, and coordinates, is there any ablation study for the separately and jointly learning of crystal geometry?\n- The CDVAE employs SE(3) equivariant GNNs adapted with periodicity to ensure the invariance of materials.
