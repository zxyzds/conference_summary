    "title": "Causal Graph Transformer for Treatment Effect Estimation Under Unknown Interference",
    "abstract": "Networked interference, also known as the peer effect in social science and spillover effect in economics, has drawn increasing interest across various domains. This phenomenon arises when a unit\u2019s treatment and outcome are influenced by the actions of its peers, posing significant challenges to causal inference, particularly in treatment assignment and effect estimation in real applications, due to the violation of the SUTVA assumption. While extensive graph models have been developed to identify treatment effects, these models often rely on structural assumptions about networked interference, assuming it to be identical to the social network, which can lead to misspecification issues in real applications. To address these challenges, we propose an Interference-Agnostic Causal Graph Transformer (CauGramer), which aggregates peers information via $L$-order Graph Transformer and employs cross-attention to infer aggregation function for learning interference representations. By integrating confounder balancing and minimax moment constraints, CauGramer fully incorporates peer information, enabling robust treatment effect estimation. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CauGramer.",

                "value": "The paper addresses causal inference in situations involving interference, where both the interference graph and the summary function are unknown (note that the interference graph is distinct from a social network). The authors assume that interference occurs within an \nL-order neighbor network, where peer information can be aggregated using a graph transformer. They utilize a cross-attention mechanism to capture complex sequential interference representations. Additionally, they apply techniques such as regularization to balance the distribution of confounders across control and treatment groups, and they leverage moment conditions to account for confounding and mitigate model misspecification."

However, if the approach is limited to neighboring nodes only, it risks undermining this motivation. On the other hand, if this limitation is not imposed, the computational complexity becomes quadratic in the number of nodes when using transformers, which poses feasibility issues for large graphs.\n\nAdditionally, a category of related work on non-iid data, particularly doubly robust estimators, IPW, and representation-based methods, appears to be missing from the review. Including this literature [1, 2, 3] could provide a more comprehensive view of the field.\n\nSince doubly robust estimators represent the state-of-the-art for causal parameter inference and have advantages over IPW-based methods, adding at least one of these approaches as a baseline would further strengthen the comparisons [1, 2, 3].\n\n\nrefs:\n[1] Ogburn, Elizabeth L., et al. \u201cCausal inference for social network data.\u201d Journal of the American Statistical Association 119.545 (2024): 597-611.\n[2] Khatami, Seyedeh Baharan, et al. \u201cGraph Neural Network based Double Machine Learning Estimator of Network Causal Effects.\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.11332 (2024)\n[3] Leung, Michael P., and Pantelis Loupos. \u201cUnconfoundedness with network interference.\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.07823 6 (2022)."
