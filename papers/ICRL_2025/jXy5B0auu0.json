    "title": "MoDiff: a Protein Diffusion Model for Multi-motif Scaffolding Problem",
    "abstract": "The motif scaffolding problem, crucial in drug and enzyme design, involves creating a scaffold to support one or more specified motifs. Existing methods employ the paradigm of inpainting, thereby limiting their applicability to scenarios where only a single motif is present or the positions between multiple motifs are known. However, in many significant scenarios, the positions between motifs are unknown, leaving the multi-motif scaffolding problem open. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a protein diffusion model called MoDiff. During the diffusion process, MoDiff implicitly assigns motifs to the protein backbone, thereby achieving the automatic design of relative positions among motifs. Our experiments demonstrate that MoDiff can: 1) solve the multi-motif scaffolding problem even when the positions between motifs are unknown, and 2) generate diverse scaffolds based on multiple given motifs. This indicates that MoDiff is a potential general solution to the multi-motif scaffolding problem.",

The Implicit Matching Module is an interesting implementation to encourage the model to learn the matching between motifs and the protein.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "One major concern with this paper is the lack of comparisons with other models. While MoDiff is designed to tackle a novel and more general task, it is crucial to compare MoDiff with other models on previously reported tasks (which are subtasks of the problem at hand) to provide a better understanding of model performance. For example,\n- How well is MoDiff capturing the underlying protein structure space, which forms the basis for the success of multi-motif scaffolding? \n- How does MoDiff perform in scaffolding a single motif (or the test set $M^{exist}$) compared to RFDiffusion? Though it might not be a completely fair comparison since the relative sequence and structure positions are unknown to MoDiff, it is helpful to understand if this additional flexibility helps with motif scaffolding (since the model could now optimize for motif positions).\n- Recent work of Genie 2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15489) also attempts to tackle the problem of multi-motif scaffolding, though it maintains the relative position between motif sequences. It would be helpful to compare MoDiff to Genie 2 on the same set of multi-motif scaffolding tasks."

                "value": "- Motif sequence is crucial for the functionality of a motif. Is the motif sequence fixed in this design setting? Is the motif sequence information passed into the model? Is the motif sequence fixed in the ProteinMPNN sequence design?\n- Figure 2A: It looks like a motif is defined as a continuous sequence of residues. Can a motif consist of multiple segments (with fixed relative positions between segments in the motif)? Does MoDiff support scaffolding with multiple motifs, where one or more of these motifs consist of multiple segments? This is important since residues involved in a functional motif could be close in the structural space but distant in the sequence (resulting in discontinuous segments in a motif).\n- It would be helpful if the authors would provide a summary of VFN architecture in the Appendix and highlight the key differences between VFN and other frame-based architectures like IPA in AF2. What is the key motivation for the use of VFN and does it demonstrate better performance compared to other architectures? In addition, what is the architecture of SeqTrans? Is it a standard attention-based transformer?\n- What is the rationale of using scTM > 0.5 as the designability metric instead of scRMSD < 2 that is more stringent and commonly used in recent motif scaffolding diffusion work like RFDiffusion?\n- Section 5.2: What criteria are used for excluding PROSITE motifs present in the training dataset? How many motifs are there after this filtering process? Given that $M^{exist}$ and $M^{unknown}$ have a size of 20 and 6 respectively, what is the variation in both cases? How would the model perform for a different set of motif problems or for a larger set of motif problems?\n- Section 5.3: When assessing novelty, does the PDB dataset contain PDB files from $M^{exist}$ and $M^{unknown}$?"

In the introduction, the explanation of existing methods (inpainting methods) for the multi-motif scaffolding problem is somewhat limited, and the inefficiency of traditional cross-attention methods is not fully explained. Additionally, some contributions could be better clarified.\n-  Although the authors describe showcasing the promising prospects of deep learning approaches in the contribution, it feels somewhat awkward, as the introduction does not compare deep learning with traditional computational methods. It might be more natural to explain why deep learning is needed for this task or highlight the challenges of the multi-motif scaffolding problem and the importance of addressing it.\n\n- The description of MoDiff\u2019s model, core keywords, and advantages is somewhat unclear. A more precise explanation would help in highlighting the strengths of the method.\n\n2. IMM is proposed to capture the motif correspondence (\u03c0_1,\u03c0_2), but based on the provided equations (10) and (11), it appears to compute and learn attention for each motif (M_1, M_2) separately in relation to the protein backbone representation. This approach doesn\u2019t seem to directly address the relationship between M_1 and M_2. A more effective approach might involve jointly considering the attention for M_1 and M_2.\n\n3. In section 5.3 \"More motifs\" part, MoDiff is described as the \"first method,\" but FADiff [1] already addresses this problem. This claim may need rephrasing, and it would also be helpful to check if a comparative analysis with FADiff is possible.\n\n4. The code has not yet been released, which, if provided, would enhance reproducibility and facilitate a better understanding of the method."

A more detailed explanation in the introduction would also help clarify this key strength of the method.\n2. In the methods section on p5, there is a symbol \"??\". It seems to be a latex mapping error, please check this.\n3.  In section 4.2.2 (\"The protein backbone branch\"), it says that parameters are not shared across iterations. Does this mean a different model is used for each iteration? If so, could you explain why this approach was chosen?\n4. (W3) In Table 2, it seems VFN-Miff was evaluated on M^exist. Are there other baselines available for comparison? Additionally, FADiff [1] is also reported to address the multi-motif scaffolding problem. Could you consider including performance comparisons with this model?\n5. In section 5.4, it is mentioned that L_MR and IMM improved success rates by 10% and 14%, respectively. Could you clarify which results were used for this comparison? Does this mean that the experiments leveraging both L_MR and IMM achieved approximately 10% and 14% higher success rates than experiments where each component was tested individually?\n\n[1] Liu et al.

It is not clear from Section 5.4 whether the ablation of IMM replaces it with cross attention, or removes the conditioning entirely - a much easier baseline to beat. For this reason I am recommending rejection, but the paper could be improved by demonstrating the insufficiency of cross attention more clearly.\n\nThe paper uses VFN-Diff, but it would be interesting to see if the ideas improve performance on other SE(3) diffusion models. Although qualitative results are given for 3+ motifs, the paper could be improved by benchmarking the model on tasks with more motifs. The more in-depth analyses within this paper could also be repeated for the ablated methods.\n\nMinor comment: line 239 refers to a section that does not exist."

Experimental results indicate that MoDiff can generate scaffolds containing multiple specified motifs and shows reasonable success in protein design tasks.

There are few comparative methods and experimental results, and the paper lacks evaluations using the most basic motif-scaffolding benchmark provided by RFdiffusion.\n3. The presentation is mediocre.

If the relative orientations and positions between motifs are known, how is this information utilized and how is their relative positioning preserved during generation?\n3. For single-motif scaffolding tasks, how does the performance compare to RFdiffusion on the benchmark?\n4. Generally, the function of a motif is highly dependent on both its structure and its side-chain sequence. Therefore, most studies retain the motif sequence. Why is this aspect not considered here?\n5. How can it be verified that injecting motifs in the latent space is superior in terms of direct physical meaning compared to using a 2D distogram as a template (e.g., RFdiffusion for VHH, GENIE2)?"
