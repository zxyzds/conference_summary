    "title": "QMP: Q-switch Mixture of Policies for Multi-Task Behavior Sharing",
    "abstract": "Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to learn several tasks simultaneously for better sample efficiency than learning them separately. Traditional methods achieve this by sharing parameters or relabeling data between tasks.  In this work, we introduce a new framework for sharing behavioral policies across tasks, which can be used in addition to existing MTRL methods. The key idea is to improve each task's off-policy data collection by employing behaviors from other task policies. Selectively sharing helpful behaviors acquired in one task to collect training data for another task can lead to higher-quality trajectories, leading to more sample-efficient MTRL. Thus, we introduce a simple and principled framework called Q-switch mixture of policies (QMP) that selectively shares behavior between different task policies by using the task's Q-function to evaluate and select useful shareable behaviors.  We theoretically analyze how QMP improves the sample efficiency of the underlying RL algorithm.  Our experiments show that QMP's behavioral policy sharing provides complementary gains over many popular MTRL algorithms and outperforms alternative ways to share behaviors in various manipulation, locomotion, and navigation environments.

While parallelization helps, this still leads to significant computational costs, especially for large task sets as evidenced by the 7+ days runtime in MT50 experiments.\n2. The method heavily relies on accurate Q-function estimation to select appropriate behaviors. This dependency may lead to suboptimal behavior selection during early training or in tasks with sparse rewards where Q-function learning is unstable.\n\n3. The method requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as manually setting 70% task-specific policy usage in Meta-World MT10. This tuning requirement may limit practical applicability.\n\n4. The method's effectiveness heavily depends on the existence of shareable behaviors between tasks. Performance gains might be limited for completely unrelated or highly conflicting task sets.\n\n5. The convergence analysis primarily focuses on tabular MDPs. The theoretical guarantees may not fully extend to continuous state-action spaces with function approximation."

The approach enables an agent to leverage useful behaviors from other tasks during off-policy data collection, guided by the Q-function of the current task to identify beneficial actions. Unlike traditional MTRL methods that rely on uniform sharing or regularization, QMP avoids biasing policy objectives by only sharing behaviors during data collection rather than directly influencing policy updates. Experimental results across various environments, including manipulation and locomotion tasks, demonstrate QMP's capability to accelerate training and improve performance when integrated with existing MTRL frameworks."

However, on the other hand, it's not intuitively clear why QMP works as well as it does. The proposed method is quite simple: it uses the current $Q_i$ function to select the argmax policy $\\pi_j^{mix}$. Then, $\\pi_j^{mix}$ (rather than $\\pi_i$) is used to generate one-step data for training. I have some concerns about the approach of naively taking the maximum over per-task Q-functions\u2014this may not be suitable in general settings, such as more stochastic environments, as it could lead to issues like switching tasks at every step or favoring certain tasks while neglecting others, which is undesirable. If this paper is accepted, it might be perceived as presenting a general framework for MTRL, but I have serious doubts about this claim.\n\nIn the introduction section of the paper, it mentions 'These tasks share many similar behaviors, like approaching the tabletop or grasping the object handle.' Therefore, I think 'behavior' refers to an action sequence or subtask that continues for a period of time. However, Algorithm 1 (one-step action sharing) appears to be misaligned with the paper's title and motivation, which emphasizes behavior (action sequence) sharing. The paper's motivation requires significant revision to address this discrepancy."
