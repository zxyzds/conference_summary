    "title": "Hydra-SGG: Hybrid Relation Assignment for One-stage Scene Graph Generation",
    "abstract": "DETR introduces a simplified one-stage framework for scene graph generation (SGG) but faces challenges of sparse supervision and false negative samples. The former occurs because each image typically contains fewer than 10 relation annotations, while DETR-based SGG models employ over 100 relation queries. Each ground truth relation is assigned to only one query during training. The latter arises when one ground truth relation may have multiple queries with similar matching scores, leading to suboptimally matched queries being treated as negative samples. To address these, we propose Hydra-SGG, a one-stage SGG method featuring a Hybrid Relation Assignment. This approach combines a One-to-One Relation Assignment with an IoU-based One-to-Many Relation Assignment, increasing positive training samples and mitigating sparse supervision. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that removing self-attention between relation queries leads to duplicate predictions, which actually benefits the proposed One-to-Many Relation Assignment. With this insight, we introduce Hydra Branch, an auxiliary decoder without self-attention layers, to further enhance One-to-Many Relation Assignment by promoting different queries to make the same relation prediction. Hydra-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including VG150 (16.0 mR@50), Open Images V6 (50.1 weighted score), and GQA (12.7 mR@50). Our code and pre-trained models will be released.",

The One-to-One Assignment, One-to-Many Assignment, and HydraBranch are each discussed with sufficient detail, making it easier for readers to follow the technical contributions. Furthermore, the inclusion of pseudocode and diagrams helps clarify how each component interacts within the framework.\n\n**2.Comprehensive Experimental Validation:** The paper provides extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets, Visual Genome, OpenImage, GQA, and demonstrates that Hydra-SGG, consistently outperforms existing baselines. The authors also conduct detailed ablation studies, examining the impact of various components (Threshold T, Training Epoch, Number of Relation Queries). The results substantiate the claim that the framework is a substantial improvement over current model."

                "value": "**1.Lack of Novelty:** The motivation and methodology of this work closely resemble those presented in [3], raising questions about its originality and distinct contributions. In particular, [3] introduced the one-to-many relation query matching technique, known as Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment, which enhances training efficiency by allowing a single ground truth (GT) to correspond to multiple sufficiently close predictions or queries. While this work makes a slight modification by removing self-attention among relation queries, this adjustment alone does not constitute a significant advancement in one-stage SGG research. As a result, it is difficult to regard this work as a notably innovative contribution. Further discussion is warranted to clarify how this work differentiates itself from existing approaches.\n**2.Perverse Experimental Results:** The rationale for assigning ground truth (GT) to multiple sub-optimal queries is based on label softening and knowledge distillation. However, applying this approach to scene graph datasets with long-tailed distributions (e.g., Visual Genome, OpenImage, PSG) introduces significant challenges. This method tends to overemphasize common relationships (e.g., on, of, has) in the annotations, which can lead to model overfitting on these frequent relationships. Consequently, this emphasis on common relationships undermines the model\u2019s ability to accurately capture rare relationships (e.g., standing on, walking on, lying on), ultimately lowering average recall performance. Given these limitations, a decline in mRecall performance would be expected for such datasets. Surprisingly, however, the experimental results in Table 1 show the opposite. Since this study does not incorporate any specific solutions to address data imbalance, the observed improvement in mRecall is unexpected. This outcome appears to contradict the foundational assumptions of the proposed Hydra-SGG approach, indicating a need for further analysis.\n\n**3.Inadequate Model Performance:** Despite showing a substantially lower R@100 score than the DSGG method [6], the Hydra-SGG model demonstrates a corresponding improvement in the mR@100 metric. Based on prior research [5], incorporating the F-Recall metric would provide a more comprehensive assessment of Hydra-SGG\u2019s effectiveness relative to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with other relevant studies [2].\n\n**Ref:**\n\n[1] Pair then Relation: Pair-Net for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation.
