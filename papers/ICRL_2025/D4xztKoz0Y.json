    "title": "Learning Shape-Independent Transformation via Spherical Representations for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation",
    "abstract": "Category-level object pose estimation aims to determine the pose and size of novel objects in specific categories. Existing correspondence-based approaches typically adopt point-based representations to establish the correspondences between primitive observed points and normalized object coordinates. However, due to the inherent shape-dependence of canonical coordinates, these methods suffer from semantic incoherence across diverse object shapes. To resolve this issue, we innovatively leverage the sphere as a shared proxy shape of objects to learn shape-independent transformation via spherical representations. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel architecture called SpherePose, which yields precise correspondence prediction through three core designs. Firstly, We endow the point-wise feature extraction with $\\mathrm{SO(3)$-invariance, which facilitates robust mapping between camera coordinate space and object coordinate space regardless of rotation transformation. Secondly, the spherical attention mechanism is designed to propagate and integrate features among spherical anchors from a comprehensive perspective, thus mitigating the interference of noise and incomplete point cloud. Lastly, a hyperbolic correspondence loss function is designed to distinguish subtle distinctions, which can promote the precision of correspondence prediction. Experimental results on CAMERA25, REAL275 and HouseCat6D benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, verifying the effectiveness of spherical representations and architectural innovations.",

                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of object pose estimation in 3D space, specifically overcoming the limitations of existing methods that rely heavily on 3D model shapes. It proposes an approach called SpherePose, which utilizes spherical representations to create shape-independent transformations, thereby improving correspondence prediction accuracy. The method incorporates three core innovations: SO(3)-invariant feature extraction, spherical feature interaction using attention mechanisms, and a hyperbolic correspondence loss function for precise supervision. This paper mainly introduces a new proxy shape for objects and a robust architecture for category-level pose estimation. Empirical validation shows superior performance against state-of-the-art methods."

The spherical feature construction on the SO(3) HEALPix grid, combined with a hyperbolic correspondence loss, significantly improves pose estimation performance.

While the paper adopts the spherical representation, a more thorough explanation of the choice of spherical shapes would be helpful.\n\n2. Size Estimation Despite Normalization:\u2028Section 3.1 mentions that the point cloud utilizes normalized coordinates, yet the method predicts the size parameter \u201cs\u201d.  How is accurate size estimation achieved despite normalization? Clarification on this aspect is necessary.\n\n3. Focus on SO(3) Over SE(3):\u2028The method predicts rotation \u201cR\u201d and translation \u201ct\u201d, focusing on SO(3) invariance. Why is roto-translation-invariance (SE(3)) not considered? (and scale-invariance) This oversight could limit the method\u2019s robustness in varying spatial contexts.\n\n4. SO(3)-Invariant Features and Rotation Discrimination:\nIn Section 3.1, if point-wise features are SO(3)-invariant, how does the method differentiate between different rotations? Wouldn't rotation-\u201cinvariant\u201d features cause the model to lose rotational information? An explanation on how SO(3)-equivariant features are maintained would be insightful.\n\n5. Shape-Independence and HEALPix Projection:\nIn section 3.1. HEALPix Spherical projection, does that anchor-based projection guarantee to preserve shape-independence? Even if the spherical projection is already proposed in VI-Net (Lin et al., 2023), ensuring its effectiveness in preserving shape-independence is critical in this framework.\n\n6. Correspondence-Based Loss in Linear Space:\nIn lines 357-358, the paper claims that learning correspondence-based loss is easier in linear space. Why is this the easier case? Would direct regression provide a better supervisory signal? Providing supporting evidence would strengthen this claim.\n\n7. HEALPix vs. Other Grids:\u2028It is convinced that the choice of the HEALPix grid over random rectangular SO(3) grids is explained by the drawbacks of equirectangular grids near the poles. \nHowever, could a random SO(3) grid serve as a viable alternative? \nAdditionally, in Table 7, evaluating other SO(3) spherical grids, such as SuperFibonacci spirals [A], would provide a comprehensive comparison, given its fast construction properties.\n\n[A] Super-Fibonacci Spirals: Fast, Low-Discrepancy Sampling of SO(3) (Marc Alexa, CVPR 2022)\n\n8.
