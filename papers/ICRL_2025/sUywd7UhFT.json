    "title": "Unifying All Species: LLM-based Hyper-Heuristics for Multi-objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "Optimization problems are fundamental across various fields, including logistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics, where challenges are often characterized by complexity, high dimensionality. Modeling the interplay among multiple objectives is beneficial for optimization. However, existing Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches show limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency, primarily focusing on single-objective optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Objective Hierarchical Reflective Evolution (MHRE), for optimizing and generating heuristics algorithms for a broad range of optimization problems. Specifically, we extend the optimization space of the conventional hyper-heuristic methodologies, which allows us to unify similarity algorithms. We successfully construct Generalized Evolutionary Metaheuristic Algorithm (GEMA) for unifying metaheuristic algorithms. Yielding improved performance in experimental results. To show the performance of our method, we further applied the MHRE framework to optimize the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art results on random TSP problems and the TSPLib benchmark datasets. Our findings illustrate that the MLHH framework offers a robust and innovative solution for tackling complex optimization challenges, paving the way for future research in this area.\nFor better reproducibility, we open source the code at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MHRE-BB53}.",

                "value": "This paper introduces an approach, which uses LLMs to construct hyper-heuristics for optimization tasks. The heuristic is then assessed on traveling salesperson problems (TSP) and continuous single-objective optimization problems. For the TSP, the heuristic provides an alternative approach to ant-colony optimization (ACO) and is benchmarked on 26 small- to medium-sized instances of the TSPlib with instance sizes ranging between 48 and 1655 nodes. For continuous optimization, the heuristic is benchmarked against five algorithms from the infamous EC bestiary (https://github.com/fcampelo/EC-Bestiary)."

In contrast, especially the algorithms that were considered in the continuous optimization problems are known to be part of the EC bestiary and should absolutely be avoided (see ref. [1, 2] listed below).\n- For the TSP studies, the authors focussed on ACO. However, ACO is not a competitive TSP heuristic anymore. In fact, modern TSP approaches (e.g., refined versions of EAX and LKH) easily find the optimal tours for the TSP instances considered in Table 4.\n- The first sentence of both the abstract and the introduction are identical, except for some missing words at the end of the sentence in the abstract.\n\n\n[1] Camacho\u2010Villal\u00f3n, Christian L., Marco Dorigo, and Thomas St\u00fctzle. \"Exposing the grey wolf, moth\u2010flame, whale, firefly, bat, and antlion algorithms: six misleading optimization techniques inspired by bestial metaphors.\" International Transactions in Operational Research 30.6 (2023): 2945-2971.\nDOI: 10.1111/itor.13176\n\n[2] Aranha, Claus, Christian L.

There exist various tools and platforms, which allow to benchmark single-objective optimization heuristics across multiple benchmark functions, such as COCO, IOHprofiler, Nevergrad, etc.\n- How many runs were performed for each algorithm per problem? And what was the termination criterion per algorithm (stagnation, fixed number of function evaluations, CPU time, ...)?\n- There exist various heuristic approaches that are capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple optimization domains (including TSP and single-objective optimization). I suggest, the authors have a look at topics such as automated algorithm selection, automated algorithm configuration, and automated algorithm design.\n- To assess the (reproducibility of the) results, I would encourage the authors to share their code."
