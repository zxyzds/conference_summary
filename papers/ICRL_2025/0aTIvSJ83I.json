    "title": "Agnostic Sharpness-Aware Minimization",
    "abstract": "Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has been instrumental in improving deep neural network training by minimizing both the training loss and the sharpness of the loss landscape, leading the model into flatter minima that are associated with better generalization properties. In another aspect, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a framework designed to improve the adaptability of models. MAML optimizes a set of meta-models that are specifically tailored for quick adaptation to multiple tasks with minimal fine-tuning steps and can generalize well with limited data. In this work, we explore the connection between SAM and MAML in enhancing model generalization. We introduce Agnostic-SAM, a novel approach that combines the principles of both SAM and MAML. Agnostic-SAM adapts the core idea of SAM by optimizing the model toward wider local minima using training data, while concurrently maintaining low loss values on validation data. By doing so, it seeks flatter minima that are not only robust to small perturbations but also less vulnerable to data distributional shift problems. Our experimental results demonstrate that Agnostic-SAM significantly improves generalization over baselines across a range of datasets and under challenging conditions such as noisy labels or data limitation.",

The authors mention this paper, but don't bother to explain the similarities or differences. The method here looks **eerily similar** to the two-year old prior work, which is arguably better written and presented and a lot more richer. Except for little bits of analysis on congruence between gradients, I can't spot much of a methodological difference. \n\n- Supervised learning experiments: In departure to their motivation, the authors start presenting results on supervised learning. I understand that this can be simulated in the meta-learning setup as well, but it comes across as confusing. Then their method involves 4 gradient computations per step, while SGD and SAM will involve 1 and 2 gradient computations respectively. So for a fairer comparison, the authors should have reported results with letting the baselines have more compute. Thus, given the excessive runtime, the method does not seem worth the effort of obtaining marginal gains. \n\n- Ablation studies on the relevance for SAM in inner/outer stages of meta-learning would have been insightful: Which part benefits more from SAM? Can the authors run an ablation study?\n\n- Momentum hyperparameter and it's ablation: The Table 8 would suggest that having no momentum results in better performance, but it is bizarre that the authors continue to keep using a momentum in all their results, despite of that. Especially when the improvements they report are not infrequently of the similar range."

They are two of many potential ways to improve generalization performance, but without clearly justifying why these two, the paper simply combine the two approaches and end up providing experimental results. This diminishes the technical contributions and novelty.\n- The authors also claim that it is a \"framework\", but with it being the simple combination of SAM and MAML, it has not been rigorously evaluated to be a framework as to whether this can serve as a general scheme so it remains as an initial idea. There have been many advancements since the original SAM and MAML, but the paper only takes a proof-of-concept approach, limiting its potential.\n- This idea requires additional computations (validation set, additional forward-backward, hyperparameter tuning) but it is unclear whether this is worth, in particular, compared to other potential ways to improve generalization.\n\nExperiments\n- The experiments are also a bit bland without being tailored to specifically analyze any aspect of SAM and MAML simply evaluating the final performances, lacking novelty and interesting insights.\n- The proposed scheme is only compared to naive baselines, and it is seen that the improvements are very marginal across many experiments. It is a bit critical in the sense that Agnostic-SAM makes use of the additional validation set and more computations to get validation gradients, which leaves a question that whether Agnostic-SAM is really the best possible choice for generalization."

However, in practice, the training set is used as the validation set, which diverges from the theoretical framework.

In the experiments, SAM is compared by allowing SGD to run for double the iterations for fair comparison [1]. It would be fairer to allow SAM and ASAM to run for twice the iterations of Agnostic-SAM in the experiment.\n\n[1] Foret, P., Kleiner, A., Mobahi, H., and Neyshabur, B.

                "value": "**Comparison to Baselines**\n\nAt its core, Agnostic-SAM changes the perturbation step of SAM by adding an additional perturbation based on gradients from a separate, smaller data batch, and the authors claim improved generalization performance. However, several methods have proposed adjustments to SAM\u2019s perturbation model with improved generalization performance. Most similar to Agnostic-SAM, [1] adds random perturbations to the gradient-based perturbation, while [2] and [3] perform multi-step perturbations. Many more methods exist ([6,7,8,...]), but none of those appear as baselines in the experiments. The only other standard baselines are in Table 2 (ASAM), and in Table 5 (ASAM and FSAM). In the MAML experiment (Tables 6 and 7) the authors report improved performance over [9]. However, they only show the Sharp-MAML-low version from [9], even though other versions exist. In particular, the Sharp-MAML-both variant from [9] outperforms Agnostic-SAM in three out of the four reported cases. It is unclear why this is not reported or explained. \n\n\n**Training time**\n\nThe proposed method requires two additional forward-backward passes on the validation batch, which leads to increased computational cost compared to SAM (roughly 27\\% wall clock time according to Table 9). While the authors briefly mention this in the conclusion, a more thorough discussion and evaluation is needed, as this affects the fairness of comparisons in the main paper.\n\n\n**Hyperparameters and train settings**\n\nThe authors report some baseline values from the original papers, and others are reproduced with the $\\rho$ values from those papers. For instance, for WRN28-10 on CIFAR100 the SGD number is taken from the SAM paper [5], and the SAM number is reproduced with the same $\\rho$ value, but is lower than the number from the SAM paper (83.0\\% vs 83.5\\% in the SAM paper, which would outperform the reported Agnostic-SAM number). Similar observations hold for ASAM, and CIFAR100. Lower reproduced numbers can be due to different training settings and are not a problem per se if the comparison is fair, but here I have certain doubts because the optimal $\\rho$ value can be sensitive to the training settings and was taken from the reference papers. Further, some choices, like e.g. $\\rho=0.05$ for SAM in ImageNet transfer learning while $\\rho=0.1$ for ImageNet training from scratch look just arbitrary. Some $\\rho$ tuning must have taken place, since the authors even claim that _accuracies tend to decrease when reducing $\\rho$_. Further, it is unclear how exactly the authors came up with the choice $\\rho_{1}=2\\rho_{2}$ and if it is based on the ablation in A2, purely by intuition or additional experiments and tuning. Finally, the scope of the experiments is somewhat limited. In particular, there are no experiments with VisionTransfomers, no experiments on text data, and the only larger-scale experiments (ImageNet) are with fairly weak models (at most ResNet-34 for training from scratch).\n\n\n**Theorem 1**\n\nThe authors present Theorem 1 as a central motivation for their method. However, this theorem is nearly identical to Theorem 1 and its proof in the original SAM paper [5], with minimal modification. As with [5], this theorem would theoretically motivate a version of SAM based on average-case rather than worst-case perturbations. The presented generalization bound implies an average-case sharpness bound, which is only subsequently upper-bounded by a worst-case sharpness bound. This limitation was already present in [5] and has since been highlighted, for example, in [4]. Furthermore, the conclusions from this theorem, i.e. why exactly it would motivate equation (3) and the final algorithm, are not understandable to me.  \n\n\n**Clarity**\n\nApart from the disconnect between Theorem 1 and the method, it is not well justified why exactly the alignment of the gradients of the perturbed points from train and validation batches would be beneficial for generalization, especially since in the experiments both batches are from the train set. Overall, the MAML perspective is unclear to me, since in the practical algorithm, train and validation batches are both sampled from the train set, and there is only one task to solve in almost all experiments. Additional confusion arises from unclear terminology  (e.g. the notation $\\theta^{*}(\\theta)$ wasn\u2019t introduced, the Taylor expansion in (7) is presented as an exact equality, etc.)\n\n\n\n[1] Yong Liu, Siqi Mai, Minhao Cheng, Xiangning Chen, Cho-Jui Hsieh, & Yang You (2022).
