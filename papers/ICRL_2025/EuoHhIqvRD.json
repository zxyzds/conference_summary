    "abstract": "This paper extensively investigates the effectiveness of synthetic training data to improve the capabilities of vision-and-language models for grounding textual descriptions to image regions. We explore various strategies to best generate image-text pairs and image-text-box triplets using a series of pretrained models under different settings and varying degrees of reliance on real data. Through comparative analyses with synthetic, real, and web-crawled data, we identify factors that contribute to performance differences, and propose SynGround, an effective pipeline for generating useful synthetic data for visual grounding. Our findings show that SynGround can improve the localization capabilities of off-the-shelf vision-and-language models and offers the potential for infinite data generation. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game accuracy of pretrained ALBEF and BLIP models by 4.81% and 17.11% absolute percentage points, respectively, across the RefCOCO+ and the Flickr30k benchmarks.",

                "value": "We thank all the reviewers for their time and comments. We are withdrawing the paper from consideration and will address weaknesses in our next revision.\n\nHere are some issues we are currently addressing including clarifications and experiments.\n\n**Zero-Shot Out-of-the-Distribution Visual Grounding.** This paper adopts the zero-shot training setting that trains the visual grounding methods on collected image-text-boxes and evaluates it on task-specific benchmarks, such as RefCOCO+. The leaderboard and models such as \u201cOFA\u201d mentioned by the reviewers are finetuned on the in-domain training set (e.g., RefCOCO+ training split) and evaluated on its testing split. The in-domain training should achieve better performance, but we posit that the out-of-distribution data is more accessible and can examine the generalization ability of methods.\n\n**Pointing Game Accuracy with Heatmaps vs. Accuracy with Boxes.** There are two standard settings for visual grounding, and they have different advantages. Heatmap visualizes the model\u2019s attention, making grounding theoretically more closely where the models look. Not only is it more explainable, but it is more flexible compared to bounding boxes in terms of multiple objects or background regions. However, comparing the absolute value of pointing game accuracy with the Accuracy\\@0.5 is unfeasible.\n\n**Why AMC (ALBEF)?**  To the best of our knowledge,  AMC [CVPR 2023], which adopts ALBEF as the backbone model, is still the state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding method under the pointing game accuracy and without finetuning on the training split for individual downstream datasets. We provide several other backbones to verify the effectiveness of our synthetic data and the generalization of analysis. Additionally, we want to generate effective synthetic data for both unsupervised (image-text pairs) and supervised (image-text-box triplets) learning. It is non-trivial to select a backbone that can be used for both supervised and unsupervised training (See Appendix B).\n\n**Finetuning SotA Box-based Acc\\@0.5 Model (OFA).** Our synthetic data can improve both heatmap-based and box-based grounding methods. The Acc\\@0.5 SotA at RefCOCO+, OFA, mentioned by the reviewers, was trained on the RefCOCO+ training split and tested on the RefCOCO+ testing split. Here, we evaluated the zero-shot grounding performance on RefCOCO+ and finetuned it for out-of-distribution zero-shot performance. The off-the-shelf OFA-Base without finetuning on RefCOCO+ is much lower than the in-domain (row 1) training-testing result. However, our synthetic data improves OFA dramatically and comes close to VG finetuning.\n\n|  | Finetuning Data | RefCOCO+ Val   | RefCOCO+ Test A | RefCOCO+ Test B |\n|-----------------|----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| OFA_Base        | RefCOCO+ | 81.39 | 87.15  | 74.29  |\n| OFA_Base        | -        | 29.78 | 31.24  | 27.82  |\n| OFA_Base        | VG       | 54.29 | 59.52  | 48.19  |\n| OFA_Base        | SynGround| 49.53 | 52.31  | 45.37  |\n\n**LLaVA for Visual Grounding.** LLaVA does not provide a downstream application for visual grounding, and there is no straightforward approach to using LLaVA for this purpose. Unlike VLMs that use image-text matching or contrastive loss for attention map extraction, LLaVA is trained with an autoregressive loss, making it unclear how to extract a GradCAM explanation. Adapting LLaVA for visual grounding would require significant modifications, such as integrating an additional box decoder or adding location tokens during training, which are beyond the scope of our research on data synthesis. \n\nNotably, the LLaVA model adopts the CLIP image encoder, the same as ALBEF, BLIP, and METER. By experimenting with ALBEF, BLIP, and METER, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic data through extensive experiments, potentially indicating that grounding improvements could be achieved for LLaVA if its structure is modified to suit the grounding task.\n\n\n**Computation Costs.** The data scale of our synthetic data is at approximately 100K images and 1M text-box pairs. Below are the computation speeds tested on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. The entire image-text-box synthesis takes 501 hours = 20.88 days on a single card.\n- Image caption generation (LLaVA): 5.71s/it *100K = 158 GPU hours. \n- Image synthesis (Stable diffusion): 4.85s/it * 100K = 135 GPU hours. \n- Text synthesis (LLM): 0.52s/it * 1M = 144 GPU hours. \n- Box synthesis (GLIP): 0.23s/it * 1M = 64 GPU hours. \n\nQuote from VG paper [3]: The dataset was curated with contributions from over 33,000 unique workers over six months, following 15 months of experimentation and refinement of data representation. \n\n**Effectiveness at the Same Efforts: Synthetic Data vs. Real Data.** Compared to the image-text pairs, image-text-box triplets are more laborious to curate. The scale for the existing image-text-box dataset is much smaller than the image-text datasets (e.g., LAION5B). \nWithin the same data curation (collection & annotation) time period, SynGround\u2019s 20.88 GPU days are 1/9 of VG\u2019s data curation time from 33,000 unique workers. Below, we provide comparisons between our synthetic data and 1/9 VG data. Their performance is on par. Plus, the scaling up observed in Sec. 3.8. Except for the analysis and findings from the data synthesis in our paper, SynGround provides a potentially feasible way to curate image-text-boxes at scale. \n\n |          | Data  | RefCOCO+ Test A | RefCOCO+ Test B |  Flickr30k |  Avg \u0394|\n|--------------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Off-the-Shelf| -        | 69.35     | 53.77 | 79.38  | -      |\n| SynGround    | Synthetic| 73.70     | 56.35 | 86.89  | +4.81  |\n| 1/9 VG       | Real     | 76.96     | 59.07 | 85.01  | +6.18  |"

One concern is that ALBEF is a much smaller model (BERT based LM), while the pipeline used to generate synthetic data leverage larger and more capable models such as LLaVA. I would be more convinced if the authors can apply their approach to improve a similar sized model. This would also alleviate concerns that this method is simply distilling a stronger ALBEF model from LLaVA generated data.\n- The gains over the baselines are not really substantial enough at the moment to warrant running this (rather convoluted) synthetic generation pipeline. Even with the synthetic data, the relative improvements are worse than using real data (Table 2) and only marginally better when combined with real data (Table 3). In Figure 5, the improvement with introducing synthetic data also seems marginal, and within the error bounds of using less data (which does not bode well for scaling).\n- The paper is rather difficult to read, and I found it structured in quite a confusing way. Figure 1 could be replaced with an overview of the full SynGround pipeline, including captioning, bounding box generation, image generation components, as well as the training objectives detailed in Sec 3.1.\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Wang, Peng, et al. \"Ofa: Unifying architectures, tasks, and modalities through a simple sequence-to-sequence learning framework.\" International conference on machine learning.
