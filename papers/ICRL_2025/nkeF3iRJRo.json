    "title": "SCISplat: 3D Gaussian Splatting from a Snapshot Compressive Image",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) for efficiently recovering 3D scenes from a single temporally compressed image. SCI offers a cost-effective approach using a series of 2D masks to compress video data into a single image captured by 2D imaging sensors. However, traditional SCI reconstruction methods face challenges with generalization and maintaining multi-view consistency. Recent advances have introduced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to estimate 3D scenes from SCI images, but NeRF\u2019s implicit representation struggles to capture fine details and support fast training and rendering. To address these issues, we propose SCISplat, a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based framework for decoding SCI images and achieving high-quality scene reconstruction from a single SCI image. First, we design an initialization protocol that robustly estimates the initial point cloud and camera poses from an SCI image, leveraging a learning-based Structure-from-Motion method. Second, we integrate the SCI image formation model into the 3D Gaussian training process and jointly optimize the Gaussians and camera poses to enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that SCISplat surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 2.3 dB improvement in reconstruction quality and a 10\u00d7 faster training speed. Furthermore, results on real-world datasets show that our approach produces cleaner and sharper details, underscoring its practical value.",

The experimental results indicate the performance of pose estimation, but the specifics of how these poses are optimized during training remain unclear.\n2. Given that the learned method (VGGSfm) offers improved initialization of camera poses, how do you anticipate other methods, such as SCINeRF, would perform if initialized with the same parameters? Would there be a notable difference in their results? \n3. To my understanding, 3DGS can effectively operate with randomly initialized point clouds. Is this also applicable to SCI data? Additionally, could you provide some visualizations demonstrating the initialization process of VGGSfM?"

In order to do so, the authors design an initialization with a point cloud for the initial 3D Gaussian means and camera poses estimated by an existing learning-based SfM pipeline (VGGSfM) that is robust enough to be applied to degraded frames decoded from the Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) measurement. After initialization, both Gaussians and camera poses are optimized jointly to fit the SCI image. An evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in image reconstruction quality while being fast to train and render."

Besides mentioning it in the related work, a reference to [1] in the description of that part of the proposed method would help avoiding misunderstandings.\n- Limited evaluation setup:\n  - The evaluation is limited to image reconstruction only, while the main baseline SCINeRF [1] additionally evaluates novel view synthesis results on views not included in the SCI measurement.\n  - Similar to [1], a comparison across different compression rates would be interesting.\n  - The evaluation on real data is limited to qualitative comparisons only. If possible, quantitative results would be helpful.\n- Some lack of contextualization w.r.t. baselines (please see questions):\n  - It is unclear how flexible previous generalizable approaches are compared to per scene optimization approaches (SCINeRF [1] and the proposed method) w.r.t.:\n    - static vs dynamic scenes\n    - camera trajectories and scene coverage\n  - The comparison of training time with EfficientSCI [5] as one example of a deep learning-based approach seems to be unfair, as the proposed method has to be optimized per 3D scene, whereas this class of baselines should generalize to unseen scenes after training.\n\nMinor comment:\n- In section 3.1.2, the modulation masks are said to be binary, while in section 3.2 thresholding is used to binarize them.

We expect the authors to provide more experimental results for scenes with different trajectory complexities or detailed theoretical analyses to further illustrate the mechanism of this paper's method in handling different types of trajectories.\n\n- Combining Fig 3 and 4, the proposed method performs more prominently on real datasets than synthetic data, especially in comparison with the SCINeRF method. It is recommended to supplement the ablation experiments on synthetic and real datasets concerning the framework or the threshold value in order to verify the relative importance of the impact of framework choices and threshold settings on performance.\n\n- As shown in Table 5, different down-sampling has different effects on different scenarios, how to choose a more general sampling strategy for more scenarios?"

Let\u2019s return to the initialization stage. Firstly, the initialization itself is introduced by 3DGS, so it\u2019s hard to attribute this module as a novel contribution\u2014it\u2019s more of a necessary design when utilizing 3DGS. Secondly, this part of the design isn\u2019t irreplaceable; at the very least, I believe that images obtained using traditional SCI recovery methods could be used for SfM calibration, even if their 3D consistency isn\u2019t perfect, as the precision required for the initial point cloud is not very high.
