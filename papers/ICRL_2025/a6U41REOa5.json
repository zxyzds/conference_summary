    "title": "Retrieval Augmented Diffusion Model for Structure-informed Antibody Design and Optimization",
    "abstract": "Antibodies are essential proteins responsible for immune responses in organisms, capable of specifically recognizing antigen molecules of pathogens. Recent advances in generative models have significantly enhanced rational antibody design. However, existing methods mainly create antibodies from scratch without template constraints, leading to model optimization challenges and unnatural sequences. To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, termed RADAb, for efficient antibody design. Our method leverages a set of structural homologous motifs that align with query structural constraints to guide the generative model in inversely optimizing antibodies according to desired design criteria. Specifically, we introduce a structure-informed retrieval mechanism that integrates these exemplar motifs with the input backbone through a novel dual-branch denoising module, utilizing both structural and evolutionary information. Additionally, we develop a conditional diffusion model that iteratively refines the optimization process by incorporating both global context and local evolutionary conditions. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple antibody inverse folding and optimization tasks, offering a new perspective on biomolecular generative models.",

This is a rather harsh critique and I would like such sentences to be backed either by citations or experiments directly showing that. It is true that the proposed approach did generally better than baselines in the chosen experiments, but the difference to DiffAb was marginal and there can be a multitude of reasons for that difference.\n\nIn the energy optimization experiment authors say that authors use structures \"folded from the original antibody sequences\" to evaluate the energy. Folding can be arbitrarilly bad in determining the loop strucutres (esp. CDR H3). So this might very much end up measuring just the agreement between the folding method and the method being tested (how common the folding method finds the sequence to be) instead of how good the energy trully would be. If sequence recovery is reasonably high, one could use grafting and MD to get higher quality/more plausable complexes. Actually, what is the RMSD to original crystal structure, of the reference structure your approach produces (RMSD of original co-crystal vs folding original Ab and runing Rosetta fast relax)?\n\nWhile in general I like the idea of data mining the PDB for similar loops and using them as reference. I find that the paper is a marginal improvement on existing literature and is of somewhat limited scope for a ICLR paper (only doing inverse folding, while say DiffAb can also do complete loop sequence + structure redesign, and having only two experiments, one of which is not fully convincing to me)."

This would expand the scope of the paper.\n\nWhen you ablate the numberk of reference loop sequences fed to the model (Figure 4), you show that the optimal number of sequences to use is 15 \"But when k exceeds 15, the additional information instead introduces noise to the model, leading to performance degradation.\". Do you have any motivation why this would be the case? I'd imagine that as long as the mined loops satisfy some RMSD/quality threshold, they should always be beneficial to the model."
