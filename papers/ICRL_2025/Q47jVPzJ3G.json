    "abstract": "Communication is a prerequisite for collaboration.\nWhen scaling networks of AI-powered agents, communication must be versatile, efficient, and portable.\nThese requisites, which we refer to as the Agent Communication Trilemma, are hard to achieve in large networks of agents.\nWe introduce Agora, a meta protocol that leverages existing communication standards to make LLM-powered agents solve complex problems efficiently.\nIn Agora, agents typically use standardised routines for frequent communications, natural language for rare communications, and LLM-written routines for everything in between. \nAgora sidesteps the Agent Communication Trilemma and robustly handles changes in interfaces and members, allowing unprecedented scalability with full decentralisation and minimal involvement of human beings. \nOn large Agora networks, we observe the emergence of self-organising, fully automated protocols that achieve complex goals without human intervention.",

                "value": "The present work introduces Agora, a meta protocol designed to facilitate communication among heterogeneous LLM agents. It addresses the Agent Communication Trilemma, which posits that scalable communication must be versatile, efficient, and portable. The authors argue that traditional communication paradigms struggle to meet these demands, particularly in networks of LLMs due to their inherent diversity, general-purpose nature, and high computational costs. The proposed Agora aims to integrate standardized routines for frequent communication and natural language for rare interactions."

The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the errors encountered during the demos and how these errors were resolved.\n\n\n3. In this paper, the models includes are Llama-3-405B which is powerful and has a high-level of instruction-following cability. \n\n\ta. How about the models with smaller sizes? How about the agents with varying instruction-following ability?  It is critical to assess the robustness of the Agora protocol across a wider spectrum of model complexities.\n\n\tb. Following this inquiry, it remains unclear how the protocol addresses instances where certain LLM models fail to adhere to instructions. Furthermore, the potential for error propagation during communication remains unexamined, which is an important consideration for the protocol\u2019s reliability and efficacy."

These protocols are established through negotiations between agents. \n\nThe authors then evaluate Agora in two examples, a network with 2 agents and with 100 agents, and highlight the cost savings of Agora with the 100 agents when compared to only using natural language."

Is it still stable with 1\u2019000 or 10\u2019000 agents?\n\nWhat is the long-term cost of Agora vs. other methods?\n- Generally, missing a comparison to baseline solutions. For instance, a network where the agents can only use protocols, and the other methods the authors mention. \n- What is the cost when starting with a partially filled-out database of protocols? Does this save time or only cost?\n\nThe paper does not discuss how to handle failures. Natural language can lead to misunderstandings, and the models can make errors when creating the protocols. What happens if there are malicious agents in the system? Can they contaminate the protocol databases? \n\nMissing a measurement of the time complexity of these networks\n\nUnclear of the cost of establishing the protocols is part of the costs\n\nUnclear if the cost only measures the LLM calls. Other APIs\n\nUnclear how/when the agents decide to create a protocol\n\nA lot of the paper is used on the trilemma (and in general text), while the paper is lacking some results in the main paper\n\nI'm generally still quite puzzled how Agora actually works. There must be tons of cases where the agents don't agree on the short hand, or misunderstand each other, etc. All this needs to be discussed in my opinion\n\nI'm willing to raise my grade if I understand better what is actually going on, and what the weaknesses are"
