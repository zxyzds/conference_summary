    "title": "Expected Sliced Transport Plans",
    "abstract": "The optimal transport (OT) problem has gained significant traction in modern machine learning for its ability to: (1) provide versatile metrics, such as Wasserstein distances and their variants, and (2) determine optimal couplings between probability measures. To reduce the computational complexity of OT solvers, methods like entropic regularization and sliced optimal transport have been proposed. The sliced OT framework improves efficiency by comparing one-dimensional projections (slices) of high-dimensional distributions. However, despite their computational efficiency, sliced-Wasserstein approaches lack a transportation plan between the input measures, limiting their use in scenarios requiring explicit coupling. In this paper, we address two key questions: Can a transportation plan be constructed between two probability measures using the sliced transport framework? If so, can this plan be used to define a metric between the measures? We propose a \u2018lifting\u2019 operation to extend one-dimensional optimal transport plans back to the original space of the measures. By computing the expectation of these lifted plans, we derive a new transportation plan, termed expected sliced transport (EST) plans. We further prove that using the EST plan to weight the sum of the individual Euclidean costs $\\|x - y\\|^p$ for moving from $x$ to $y$ results in a valid metric between the input discrete probability measures. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between our approach and the recently proposed min-SWGG, along with illustrative numerical examples that support our theoretical findings.",

The discussion starting at Line 432 should be the only part referring to the computational complexities, but I believe that this is insufficient. Their claim is that the computational complexities of the proposed method does not change w.r.t. the temperature parameter $\\tau$ while that of the entropic OT changes w.r.t. the regularization parameter $\\lambda$. What the author(s) should compare here is not the complexities **within** the algorithms but those **between** the algorithms."

Furthermore, the authors compute the expectation of the lifted transportation plan and plug the expectation into the original transportation problem. They finally proved that this transportation cost induced by their expected lift plan defines a metric. The authors later show empirical evidence for convergence of their new plan and distance with toy data and their metric properties with a MNIST variant."

The intent of the paper came into sharper focus for me well after the start of the technical section. Currently the introduction is relatively abstract in motivating the approach. I wonder whether the authors wouldn't be better served by more concrete motivations earlier. Often this is done by having a figure to illustrate the approach. Maybe figure 1 could be this if it were earlier? However, that figure would benefit from more explanation. \n- The introduction focuses on computational efficiency; however, I don't see any empirical results demonstrating this point. Because the datasets being used here aren't huge by machine learning standards, it seems important to be precise about what is meant by this claim. \n\nMinor confusions / questions that arise while I was reading: \n- \"Traditional models scale cubically\" What methods are being invoked here? \n- \"However, the number of iterations required for convergence typically increases as the regularization parameter decreases, which can offset the computational benefits of these methods.\" I don't understand this critique. \n- Around line 46: I see the citation to Cuturi there, but the discussion is inadequate: \"Various approaches have been 046 developed to address this challenge, including entropic regularization (Cuturi, 2013),\" \n- Why are we introducing transport maps in equation 5?"
