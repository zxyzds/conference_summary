    "title": "Uncertainty-aware Human Mobility Modeling and Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Given the GPS coordinates of a large collection of human agents over time, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly detection (e.g. for bad-actor or malicious behavior detection) without any labeled data?\nHuman mobility and trajectory modeling have been studied extensively with varying capacity to handle complex input, and performance-efficiency trade-offs. With the arrival of more expressive models in machine learning, we attempt to model GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each with a set of characterizing spatiotemporal features, and leverage modern sequence models such as Transformers for un/self-supervised training and inference. Notably, driven by the inherent stochasticity of certain individuals' behavior, we equip our model with aleatoric/data uncertainty estimation. In addition, to handle data sparsity of a large variety of behaviors, we incorporate epistemic/model uncertainty into our model. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty enable a robust loss and training dynamics, as well as uncertainty-aware decision making in anomaly scoring. Experiments on large expert-simulated datasets with tens of thousands of agents demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against both forecasting and anomaly detection baselines.

Lack of Novelty in Uncertainty Quantification: The techniques for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, including Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, have been widely used in other domains. The absence of a discussion on related works, specifically evidential deep learning methods, limits the novelty of the approach. Incorporating such references and discussions could strengthen the contribution of this paper.\n2. There is insufficient detail about the SimLA dataset, particularly whether it is open-source or publicly available. Clarifying this point would improve transparency and reproducibility.\n3. The decision to mask only one event per sequence in validation and testing phases is restrictive and may not reflect the full potential of the model in real-world scenarios where multiple events may be missing.\n4. The use of MC Dropout for epistemic uncertainty estimation limits the exploration of alternative methods. Testing more methods, such as deep ensembles or evidential neural networks, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of uncertainty estimation in this context."

Why was Monte Carlo Dropout chosen for epistemic uncertainty estimation, and are there plans to experiment with other methods like deep ensembles or evidential neural networks?\n4.

Using two simulated human activity datasets, the authors show that the proposed approach outperforms simpler baselines in modelling human mobility sequences and in detecting anomalous behaviors, especially showcasing and highlighting the contribution of modelling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to the results."

It is of significance for the urban mobility domain.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) Although the specific combination of existing ideas in the proposed approach is new from the application point of view, from a methodological point of view, the **low novelty** is a concern, especially **for the broader ICLR audience**. Since the contribution is of significance mostly for a transportation audience, I would encourage the authors to consider targeting a transportation journal instead since I believe this work would have more visibility and more impact there. Otherwise, for ICLR, the authors should motivate better the broader applicability of their work and their insights beyond the concrete application considered. For example, could the uncertainty-aware approach be applied to other sequence modeling tasks in different domains? Could you give some examples? \n2) The **motivation for the application considered should be improved**. Why would one want to detect abnormal mobility behaviours? The authors briefly mention that they can \"indicate security threats or spread of infectious disease\", but these use cases need to be better explained and backed up by related works where having such predictions of abnormal mobility behaviours would be relevant. This is the critical basis for the proposed work, so it needs to be articulated in a more convincing way. \n3) The **baselines considered in the paper are very naive**. However, modelling sequences of human activities is a very well-studied problem in the transportation field, and the literature is vast on different deep learning approaches, including approaches based on transformers. I encourage the authors to consider including stronger baselines from the state-of-the-art for modelling human activity sequences - i.e., at least for the predictive part (RQ1); although the extension of some of these for score-based anomaly detection is also trivial, and therefore can also be potentially considered as additional baselines for RQ2. \n4) The **soundness of the experimental setup is a concern**, given that the datasets used for validating the proposed approach are themselves simulated based on deep learning models that were trained on real-world data to generate synthetic sequences. The authors are essentially fitting a deep learning model to the output of another deep learning model. This raises at least three important questions: i) is the output of the deep generative model good enough to generate realistic synthetic sequences that capture well the data distribution, including the \"long-tails\" such that abnormal behaviors are captured? and ii) why not simply use the deep generative model that was used to generate the data to detect abnormal behaviors? What are the advantages of using the proposed transformer architecture instead? iii) why haven't the authors considered using real data to demonstrate their approach (of course, despite a quantitative evaluation being difficult/impossible)? I would suggest the authors discuss these concerns and discuss their rationale for using simulated data and the potential limitations or advantages of this approach in the paper, as well as discuss the challenges and potential approaches for evaluating real-world data.  \n5) There are several aspects of the proposed approach that are either **not properly motivated or unclear**. For example, eq. 7 is presented as \"the average predicted logits\"; however, looking at eq. 7, it seems to be the average of the exponentiated logits (i.e., likelihoods), and then the authors take the logarithm. This should be clarified and properly motivated. Also, the authors have multiple passes T for the categorical loss in eq. 7, but not for the numerical features loss in Section 3.3.2. What is the reasoning behind this distinction in approaches? Similarly, what is the reasoning for the +1 in eq. 10? I would suggest the authors provide a more detailed explanation or derivation for equation 7, and explicitly state their reasoning for the different approaches used for categorical and numerical features, as well as the addition of 1 in equation 10. \n6) Lastly, there are **several inconsistencies** in the paper. For example, it is written that \"MAPE for SD from 51.95% to 21.93%\", however these numbers don't match the values in Table 1. Similarly, it is mentioned that \"UIFORMER delivers the best performance across both datasets and for all features compared with the baselines.\". However, the MAPE of UIFORMER for ST is significantly worse than a simple transformer. These aspects should be clarified in the paper. It is also written that \"AU remains almost constant as training data size increases\"; however, looking at the table there are several significant exceptions that should be considered and discussed. I suggest that the authors carefully review their results and claims for accuracy, and provide a more nuanced discussion of their findings, particularly where the results don't align perfectly with their general claims."
