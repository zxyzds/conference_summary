    "title": "Zero-Shot Generalization of GNNs over Distinct Attribute Domains",
    "abstract": "Inductive GNNs are able to generalize across graphs with the same set of node attributes. However, zero-shot generalization across attributed graphs with disparate node attribute domains remains a fundamental challenge in graph machine learning. Existing methods are unable to effectively make use of node attributes when transferring to unseen attribute domains, frequently performing no better than models that ignore attributes entirely. This limitation stems from the fact that models trained on one set of attributes (e.g., biographical data in social networks) fail to capture relational dependencies that extend to new attributes in unseen test graphs (e.g., TV and movies preferences). Here, we introduce STAGE, a method that learns representations of _statistical dependencies_ between attributes rather than the attribute values themselves, which can then be applied to completely unseen test-time attributes, generalizing by identifying analogous dependencies between features in test. STAGE leverages the theoretical link between maximal invariants and measures of statistical dependencies, enabling it to provably generalize to unseen feature domains for a family of domain shifts. Our empirical results show that when STAGE is pretrained on multiple graph datasets with unrelated feature spaces (distinct feature types and dimensions) and evaluated zero-shot on graphs with yet new feature types and dimensions, it achieves a relative improvement in Hits@1 between 40% to 103% for link prediction, and an 11% improvement in node classification against state-of-the-art baselines.",

The authors didn't analyze why their proposed method can address the limitations they mentioned before, so it's hard to understand the intrinsic research thinking.\n4. The experiments are a little weak. For example, I believe the 4.2 and 4.3 belong to the same type of experiment, they didn't analyze the complexity and the ablation study, and they didn't include the limited research papers they mentioned in the introduction into baselines,  which weakens the convincing.\n5. I noticed this paper was submitted to ICML workshop so there is authors' information leakage. Both papers present STAGE for zero-shot generalization of GNNs across different attribute domains, and this paper just extends some real-world testing datasets. \n6. The authors didn't release their code although this is not compulsory, which may limit their reproducibility."
