    "title": "PostCast: Generalizable Postprocessing for Precipitation Nowcasting via Unsupervised Blurriness Modeling",
    "abstract": "Precipitation nowcasting plays a pivotal role in socioeconomic sectors, especially in severe convective weather warnings. Although notable progress has been achieved by approaches mining the spatiotemporal correlations with deep learning, these methods still suffer severe blurriness as the lead time increases, which hampers accurate predictions for extreme precipitation. To alleviate blurriness, researchers explore generative methods conditioned on blurry predictions. However, the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth need to be given in advance, making the training pipeline cumbersome and limiting the generality of generative models within blurry modes that appear in training data. By rethinking the blurriness in precipitation nowcasting as a blur kernel acting on predictions, we propose an unsupervised postprocessing method to eliminate the blurriness without the requirement of training with the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth. Specifically, we utilize blurry predictions to guide the generation process of a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to obtain high-fidelity predictions with eliminated blurriness. A zero-shot blur kernel estimation mechanism and an auto-scale denoise guidance strategy are introduced to adapt the unconditional DDPM to any blurriness modes varying from datasets and lead times in precipitation nowcasting. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 precipitation radar datasets, demonstrating the generality and superiority of our method.",

                "value": "The paper proposed a universal post-processing method, PostCast, designed for precipitation nowcasting. This method achieves denoising of convolution based prediction models using unconditinal DDPM through two key innovative points: zero shot blur estimation mechanism and auto scale gradient guidance strategy. The model was trained on a combination of five different datasets and prediction results generated by different models, and outperforms other conditional denoising models in terms of CSI metrics."

The paper proposes a novel approach to estimating blurriness by utilizing the gradient of metric respect to kernel parameters, which serves as a guide for the sampling of x_ {t-1}.\n2. The paper introduces an auto-scale gradient guidance strategy that automatically calculates the guidance scale corresponding to different forecast time periods, models, and datasets. This strategy enables the model to adaptively denoise the prediction results."

                "value": "1. CasCast and DiffCast are both designed for **predicting precipitation**, but not **postprocessing tasks**. It is crucial for the authors to compare with other generative models such as GAN. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of PostCast's performance against a wider range of methodologies.\n2. The authors have compared PostCast with CasCast and DiffCast only in **out-of-distribution datasets** but did not compare them on HKO7, SEVIR, etc.\n3. Relying on CSI as the only metric may not sufficiently judge the quality of precipitation prediction. The average intensity of the precipitation predictions can significantly impact CSI. For instance, using simple histogram matching on predictions can also significantly improve CSI. The authors should clarify whether the CSI improvement is due to **increased intensity** from the model or other factors to provide a more accurate assessment of the model's performance."
