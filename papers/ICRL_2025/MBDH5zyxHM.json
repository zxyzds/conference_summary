    "abstract": "Aligning diffusion models for downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or costly inference-time solutions (e.g., gradient-based guidance) to allow sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple and low-cost inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called conditional controlled denoising (C-Code), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. C-Code is a block-wise sampling method with adjustable conditioning on a reference image applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for efficient alignment with downstream rewards. Experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, C-Code offers a balanced trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

                "value": "The paper presents a new inference-time method for generating images with guidance from a reward function -- i.e., the target distribution is P_pretrained(x) * exp(lambda * r(x)), where lambda is the scale of the KL regularization term in the standard soft RL formulation. Specifically, the paper leverages the fact that reward of x0 predicted from xt (in terms of sampling with diffusion models) is a lower bound of the value function. With this, the authors propose CoDE to do a beam-search-style inference: starting from some xt, it samples a batch of sub-trajectories till time t-tau and pick the one with the greatest value V(x_{t-tau}). In cases when the reward deviates greatly from the pretrained diffusion model, the authors propose a variance dubbed C-CoDe, to denoise the image from a slightly noised version of a reference image, instead of from a Gaussian noise (as in standard diffusion sampling). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several tasks, mostly those with a reward that aims to match the generated images with a reference image (using CLIP or some similar feature extractor)."

                "value": "The paper proposes two algorithms: CoDe that works with generic rewards and C-CoDe that only works with a reference image. I feel that the paper is written in a way that blurs the boundary between these two settings. For instance, the abstract reads \"...we explore...C-CoDe, that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning\", yet the baseline methods it implies, like DDPO, deal with generic settings, not the setting with a reference target. The appropriate way to describe the method, I believe, is to say that **for this specific setting** the authors figure out C-CoDe with advantages blah blah.\n\nThe paper does mention many methods for reward finetuning, like DDPO [1] (PPO for diffusion finetuning) and ReFL [2] (direct stochastic reward optimization). ReFL and similarly methods like DRaFT [3] /AlignProp [4] indeed converge at a reasonable speed (probably less than 100 updates). Yet, the paper does not compare their method against these baselines.\n\nRegarding tuning-free methods, I also feel it is nice to cite some from the probabilistic method literature, for instance those with twisted SMC (e.g., [5]), as I found them very similar to the approach here.\n\n\n[1] Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning.

Since the same objective can be found in learning-based approaches, the paper does not state the main advantages of using the guidance compared to fine-tuning the downstream tasks. The comparison between guidance and learning-based approaches is necessary since, after fine-tuning, the fine-tuned models' sampling processes require much less computation than the proposed method. \n2. The proposed method is actually a special version of BoN; the main difference is it cuts the sampling process into B blocks. Although it can be understood that this scheme helps to reduce the accumulated errors, it can also be interpreted as a \"greedy\" scheme, which will result in a \"local minimum\". \n3. The connection between CoDe and the improved trade-off between alignment and divergence is not clearly explained. \n4.  The sampling time of CoDe will be much more significant than BoN. \n5. The motivation for introducing C-CoDe is not clear in terms of description or experimental results. Most of the results show that C-Code offers a lower running time but is much poorer in quality. The description says adding conditions will help to achieve a lower $N$ value, but the reason is not well described. \n6. Figure 2 might be not clearly explained. What does it mean by \"lowest divergence with lower N\"? Why lower $N$ is important for CoDe since CoDe has the total sampling steps of $N \\times B$ not only $N$ like BoN? How to understand the \"lowest divergence\" in this case?"

Specifically, the approach samples $N$ images and selects the one that best meets the objective of the guidance function. For more precise control with smaller values of $N$, the method introduces CoDe, which denoises each sample incrementally in blocks of $B$ steps rather than fully to $x_0$.

While simplicity can be a strength, this algorithm is rather trivial, consisting mainly of repeated sampling (BoN) and an effective initialization (SDEdit). Simple methods that aim to provide a strong baseline should convincingly outperform more complex alternatives, but this paper falls short, delivering weak results with key baseline comparisons omitted.\n\nThe experimental results, as shown in Figures 4, 5, 6, and Table 1, suggest that C-CoDe is a critical component. However, C-CoDe merely involves running SDEdit prior to CoDe. Consequently, SDEdit should serve as a primary baseline. A single qualitative comparison to SDEdit appears on the last page of the appendix (Appendix E, Figure 13), where SDEdit arguably performs slightly better. I believe SDEdit should be presented as a standalone baseline in every table and figure. Additionally, a C-BoN baseline (SDEdit + BoN) would provide an essential comparison, similar to C-CoDe.\n\nRegarding results, while C-CoDe occasionally produces relevant outputs (e.g., Figure 4 rows 1\u20132 and Figure 6), these are likely due to the influence of SDEdit. The quantitative results are also unconvincing, with C-CoDe ranking near the bottom for FID and T-CLIP. Although it scores well on I-GRAM, this is difficult to interpret without an SDEdit baseline, and the remaining I-GRAM scores fall within expected noise levels. Furthermore, SDEdit is likely faster than C-CoDe.\n\nFor these reasons, I recommend rejecting the paper from ICLR."

The ablation in Fig. 7 suggests it should perform similar to C-CoDe in terms of I-Gram but this is not the case depicted in Figs. 4,5,6."

These are also closely related to the objective explored in this paper (theorem 3.1). The authors should discuss the main differences and trade offs.\n- It is not clear to me why eq (11) should generally be true. Can you elucidate?\n- How does the unreliability of estimating r(x_0) for x_0 estimated at high temperatures affect sampling?\n- There are several questions with the C-CoDe variant. For example, at times we might have a posterior which deviates significantly from the prior (given the condition), and no reference image to use, only a reward. There does not seem to be a principled way to take advantage of the tails of the distribution in the prior model.\n- The Case study in 5.1 is much too simplistic to showcase what has been proposed. The gaussians are close to each other and the energy is simple to approximate. It is also hard to observe phenomena like mode collapse. It would be worthwhile to have a simple, yet multimodal, distribution (e.g. a posterior based on a Gaussian mixture model prior with very separate Gaussians), to at least test some coverage.\n- Figure 2: The results are generally not very compelling. It would be good to have some idea of the statistical significance of these improvements. Upper figures are missing the x-tick labels.\n- Figure 3, ticks/labels are too small to read\n- Figure 4 and 5 and 6: the truthfulness of the sentiment in the caption is very subjective. The results in Table 1 do not overall support this claim. For example, C-CoDe achieves highest I-gram but is far from performing well in terms of FID. Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the appendices show similar trends. It would be worthwhile to know how the baselines were run. How was FID computed? How was the std computed, and why are the FID values missing it?\n- DPS is sensitive to the scale, and would typically achieve very high rewards (likely at the expense of FID or other similar metrics); how was the scale tuned for the experiments?\n\n\\[1\\] Venkatraman, S., Jain, M., Scimeca, L., Kim, M., Sendera, M., Hasan, M., Rowe, L., Mittal, S., Lemos, P., Bengio, E. and Adam, A., 2024.
