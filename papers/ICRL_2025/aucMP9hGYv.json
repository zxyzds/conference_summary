    "title": "RecDreamer: Consistent Text-to-3D Generation via Uniform Score Distillation",
    "abstract": "Current text-to-3D generation methods based on score distillation often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, leading to repeated patterns across different poses of 3D assets. This issue, known as the Multi-Face Janus problem, arises because existing methods struggle to maintain consistency across varying poses and are biased toward a canonical pose. While recent work has improved pose control and approximation, these efforts are still limited by this inherent bias, which skews the guidance during generation.\nTo address this, we propose a solution called RecDreamer, which reshapes the underlying data distribution to achieve more consistent pose representation. The core idea behind our method is to rectify the prior distribution, ensuring that pose variation is uniformly distributed rather than biased toward a canonical form. By modifying the prescribed distribution through an auxiliary function, we can reconstruct the density of the distribution to ensure compliance with specific marginal constraints. In particular, we ensure that the marginal distribution of poses follows a uniform distribution, thereby eliminating the biases introduced by the prior knowledge.\nWe incorporate this rectified data distribution into existing score distillation algorithms, a process we refer to as uniform score distillation. To efficiently compute the posterior distribution required for the auxiliary function, RecDreamer introduces a training-free classifier that estimates pose categories in a plug-and-play manner. Additionally, we utilize various approximation techniques for noisy states, significantly improving system performance.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that RecDreamer effectively mitigates the Multi-Face Janus problem, leading to more consistent 3D asset generation across different poses.",

To achieve this, they develop an auxiliary function derived from the joint distribution expression of the data x and camera pose c. A key component of this auxiliary function is a well-designed, lightweight pose classifier capable of calculating p_t(c|x_0). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RecDreamer in eliminating the Janus problem."

Initially, all experiments are only tested on 22 prompts from the original DreamFusion gallery, while previous works typically use over 40.

Furthermore, the absence of recent open-sourced baseline methods that focus on addressing the Janus problem, such as ESD1 and JointDreamer2, is notable.\n2)\tThe authors introduce the concept of the \"joint distribution expression of the data and camera pose,\" but provide limited explanation of the practical meaning of such a distribution. Also, the use of a rather discrete 4-views to represent the camera pose distribution does not appear to be meaningful. More ablation studies should be conducted.\n3)\tThe authors state that the image templates are \"user-provided\" in line 317 of the main manuscript, which seems unusual.

                "value": "This paper tackles the Janus problem with score distillation-based text-to-3D generation via debiasing the camera pose distribution of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, the authors derive an auxiliary function that rectifies the pose distribution induced by the original image distribution to a targeted distribution (e.g. uniform). Consequently, the score distillation rule yielded from the debiased image distribution, termed uniform score distillation (USD), is derived as a combination of the variational score distillation plus the \u201cscore\u201d of the auxiliary function. The auxiliary rectifier can be computed with a pose classifier and a running estimator of the pose distribution over the Gaussian perturbed image distribution."

                "value": "+ This paper offers a distinctive approach to addressing the Janus problem in score distillation-based text-to-3D generation. Its central argument asserts that the pre-trained image distribution is intrinsically biased toward canonical views, causing the resulting 3D content to exhibit this same bias\u2014manifesting as the Janus problem in practical applications. This perspective contrasts with most existing score distillation methods, which often assume that the 2D pre-trained distribution is ideal and strive to align the view distribution with it more closely.\n+ The proposed method is both novel and theoretically grounded, offering a unified and principled approach to debiasing that integrates seamlessly into current score distillation frameworks. The debiasing mechanism is based on solid theoretical underpinnings yet is surprisingly straightforward to implement. All derivations appear correct. The proposed estimation for the otherwise intractable auxiliary rectifier term is thoughtfully designed, with each step justified through theoretical insight.\n+ The paper is dense and well-written, with thorough engineering details, including but not limited to an efficient pose classifier, a running estimator of the pose distribution, and improved training techniques. The results are extensive: beyond fundamental qualitative outcomes, the paper includes numerous validation experiments in the appendix, demonstrating the efficacy of each design element."

                "value": "- The quantitative results in this paper are somewhat limited. While I recognize the lack of a standard metric for evaluating generated 3D results, a few commonly used measures, such as the CLIP score demonstrated in SDS [1], could still be applied. Given the high degree of randomness often seen in score-distilled outputs, it would also be beneficial to assess the method using human evaluation, specifically by measuring the success rate of Janus-free results [2].\n\n- Another limitation is that the proposed USD appears to require reference images from various view angles, which may be impractical when the prompt is abstract or imaginary and lacks similar images on the shelf. The authors may wish to discuss potential solutions to this constraint.\n\n- The paper also overlooks several related works in the text-to-3D generation literature. While the field is vast, I suggest including a more comprehensive review. Some key omissions in the current version include: [3,4,5,6]\n\n- Many state-of-the-art approaches currently rely on training or fine-tuning generative models on 3D data. It would be interesting to show whether score distillation with the rectified distribution could largely match the performance of the distribution fine-tuned with extra data. I\u2019d also suggest demonstrate whether the proposed USD can even enhance these training-based methods.\n\n\n[1] Poole et al., DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion\n\n[2] Wang et al., Taming Mode Collapse in Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation\n\n[3] Yu et al., Text-to-3D with Classifier Score Distillation\n\n[4] Katzir et al., Noise-free Score Distillation\n\n[5] Wang et al., SteinDreamer: Variance Reduction for Text-to-3D Score Distillation via Stein Identity\n\n[6] Shi et al., MVDream: Multi-view Diffusion for 3D Generation"
