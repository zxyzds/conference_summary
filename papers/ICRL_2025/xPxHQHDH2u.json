    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has experienced significant advancements owing to increasingly capable NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.",

                "value": "Though powerful in novel view synthesis, vanilla 3DGS encounters challenges in extending to physically-based rendering or modeling inter-reflection due to lack of deterministic geometry. This work introduces a novel approach Ref-Gaussian, which achieves real-time high-quality rendering of reflective objects while also modeling inter-reflection effects.\n\nThe paper proposes several key techniques:\n(a) Geometry enhanced technique: employing 2DGS to bridge deterministic geometry with Gaussian splatting and enhancing the geometry by the novel material-aware normal propagation.\n(b) PBR optimization framework for 3DGS-based methods: using per-Gaussian PBR initialization followed with physically-based deferred rendering.\n(c) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection: applying real-time ray-tracing to the extracted mesh from 2DGS.\n\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques and that the proposed method outperforms several baselines significantly."

Experimental results showcase its SOTA performance in novel view synthesis and decomposition on reflective cases.\n2. Instead of per-Gaussian PBR (like Relightable 3DGS or Gaussian Shader), The proposed method employs an effective PBR deferred rendering to achieve better PBR performance (similar to 3DGS-DR). Further ablation study demonstrates the superiority of such a deferred rendering technique over the per-Gaussian solutions.\n3. The proposed method employs a material-aware normal propagation. This enhances normal estimation by periodically increasing the scale of 2D Gaussians with high metallic and low roughness, which demonstrates interesting material-normal interaction in 3DGS-based PBR."

The ablation study in table 3 only takes PSNR changes into account, while the influences on geometry may need further demonstration (e.g. normal MAE or qualitative illustration), in order to provide stronger evidence for effectiveness of each techniques."

                "value": "- The contribution of this paper may lack novelty. For the deferred shading part of the pipeline, I think many previous 3DGS-based inverse rendering methods[1][2][3] have adopted these techniques and [2][3] also use split-sum approximation to handle the intractable rendering equation. Further more, assigning each Gaussian with a new attribute to model the indirect lighting has also been proposed in previous methods[4]. The innovation of this method lies in the new visibility modeling scheme and optimization techniques. Unlike previous methods that use baked volume or Gaussian-based ray-tracing to model occlusion, the proposed method attempts to first extract the mesh using TSDF and then use mesh-based ray-tracing to obtain occlusion.\n\n- To determine the visibility, this method consider the occlusion at the reflected direction $\\boldsymbol{R}=2\\left(w_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{N}\\right) \\boldsymbol{N}-w_i$. This means that this method only considers the indirect lighting of the specular surface. For glossy or diffuse surfaces, this estimation may not be not accurate enough, and such objects do exist in the dataset. For example, for the Potion in figure.5, The lid of the bottle is obviously a rough diffuse surface. Since the proposed method focuses on the reconstruction of the reflective object, this does not seem to be a serious problem, but I would like to know if there is a way to improve this.\n\n- In addition, since the visibility only considers the reflected direction, I am a little confused about the integral in equation 9. Because this method does not calculate the integral over the entire hemisphere $\\Omega$. So I want to know how the rendering equation is finally calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] DeferredGS: Decoupled and Editable Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Shading https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09412 \n\n[2] GS-IR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liang_GS-IR_3D_Gaussian_Splatting_for_Inverse_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf\n\n[3] 3DGaussian Splatting with Deferred Reflection https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3641519.3657456\n\n[4] Relightable 3D Gaussians: Realistic Point Cloud\n Relighting with BRDF Decomposition and Ray\n Tracing https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/06121.pdf"

                "value": "- In ablation study, the normal of 2DGS is much better than 3DGS. Since accurate normals are very important for PBR, does this mean that the performance gain of the proposed method over other methods comes largely from the better geometry reconstruction quality of 2DGS? This is important for evaluating the technical contribution of this paper. I hope the author can give quantitative data (**use 3DGS as representation and keep the rest of the pipeline unchanged to evaluate the rendered results**) to show how much performance improvement can be achieved by using 2DGS representation compared to 3DGS.\n- Since indirect lighting is modeled as an attribute of each Gaussian, which represents the inter-reflection under the lighting conditions corresponding to the training stage. Is it possible to build indirect lighting when relighting?"

Limitation of Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection: In Eq. (8), it is clear that the direct lighting part can capture rough specular effect. But in Eq. (10), the method only traces a single reflected ray to compute the indirect reflection, which will introduce errors for rough surfaces. This should be added as a limitation.\n5. Experiments. The method leverages the extracted mesh to compute visibility, so I think the author should also show (at least qualitative) results of the extracted mesh in the experiment section.\n\nI may consider increasing the rating if my concerns and questions are addressed in the rebuttal."
