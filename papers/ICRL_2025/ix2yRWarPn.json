    "title": "Building Interactable Replicas of Complex Articulated Objects via Gaussian Splatting",
    "abstract": "Building interactable replicas of articulated objects is a key challenge in computer vision. Existing methods often fail to effectively integrate information across different object states, limiting the accuracy of part-mesh reconstruction and part dynamics modeling, particularly for complex multi-part articulated objects. We introduce ArtGS, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussians as a flexible and efficient representation to address these issues. Our method incorporates canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization and updates for aligning articulated part information across different object states, and employs a skinning-inspired part dynamics modeling module to improve both part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a new benchmark for complex multi-part objects, demonstrate that ArtGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction. Our approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and efficiency, especially for multi-part articulated objects. Additionally, we provide comprehensive analyses of our design choices, validating the effectiveness of each component to highlight potential areas for future improvement.",

The method reconstructs the shape and articulation from two states of multi-view RGB-D images with a coarse-to-fine Gaussian initialization. A skinning-related center-based part modeling is designed to automatically assign Gaussians to statics and movable parts. The articulation type is learned through self-guided parameter learning."

Center-based part modeling and assignment allow the model to assign Gaussian to different movable and static parts. The use of part centers allows multi-movable parts compared to PARIS and does not require prior part segmentation knowledge compared to DTA. \n\n4. The self-guided motion priors with part dual-quaternions improve articulation learning with a further heuristic joint type prediction.\n\n5. The experiments and ablation studies are extensive."

This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's applicability and accuracy across diverse objects.\n\nMoreover, I have some doubts regarding the main contributions and novelty of this work. The success of this method may largely derive from elements such as the coarse-to-fine training strategy, joint optimization of static shape and articulation, the use of Gaussians instead of NeRF, and super-part rigging\u2014all of which have been explored in previous research but are integrated here for this specific task. I would appreciate if the authors could further clarify their unique contributions.\n\nLastly, there is a lack of video examples to visually demonstrate the interaction of dynamic parts. Including video results would significantly help in understanding the method's advantages in complex dynamic scenarios."

However, I am not sure what is the argument for using 3DGS compared to NeRF and MVS point clouds.  \n- The authors only compare the method with DTA for visualization and with DTA and PARIS on DETA-Multi and ArtGS-Multi. Is it possible to compare with more methods? For example, some NeRF-based methods.

I think these visualizations are vital for multi-stage methods. \n- I am not sure why perception-based metrics are not reported for evaluations, e.g., PNSR and LPIPS for 3DGS evaluation. \n- Though the paper is motivated by interactive articulation objects, I did not see related evaluation and applications for it. \n- I did not see discuss about failure cases and limitations."
