    "title": "Uncertainty Aware Column Generation for Crew Pairing Optimization Using Survival Analysis",
    "abstract": "The crew pairing problem (CPP) is central to optimal planning and scheduling of operations in the airline industry, where the objective is to assign crews to cover a flight schedule at minimal cost while adhering to various logistical, personnel, and policy constraints. Despite the implementation of optimized schedules, operations are frequently disrupted by unforeseen events. This vulnerability stems from the deterministic nature of the CPP's base formulation, which fails to account for the uncertainties inherent in real-world operations. Existing solutions either aim to safeguard against a specified level of uncertainty or focus on worst-case scenarios. To this end, we propose a reliability-centric CPP formulation amenable to solution by column-generation (CG)  SurvCG, that leverages survival analysis for dynamic quantification of uncertainty using the operation patterns in historical data. Applied to CPP, SurvCG forecasts and incorporates flight connection reliability into the optimization process. Through rigorous experiments on a large-scale first-of-its-kind real-world instance under regular and irregular operating conditions, we demonstrate that SurvCG achieves unprecedented improvements (up to 61%) over baseline in terms of total propagated delays, establishing SurvCG as the first data-driven solution for uncertainty-aware reliable scheduling.",

In particular, it proposes to add a penalty term to flight connections that relates to the risk of missing the connection in the pricing subproblem of a column generation-based approach to solving the crew pairing problem. The penalty term is computed based on a prediction that is made by a survival analysis model that is trained on historical flight dely data.\n\nIn a set of computational experiments with one instance, first the cost structure of the solution obtained with the proposed (reliable) model is compared to a those obtained with a nominal model. Then, the results from simulations that propagate the delay are compared for both solutions under variouse levels of irregularity. It turns out that the solutions obtained with the reliable model show a much smaller total progagated delay, in particular under heavily irregular conditions."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The authors do not describe their crew pairing problem very well. The crew pairing problem is a very characterized by both a very complex set of regulations (e.g. rules related to total block time per day, total work time per day, rest requirements between duties) and rules and by a very complex cost structure, both of which are at least in parts very airline-specific. The authors neither describe which rules and regulations they consider. Regarding the cost of a pairing, it appears that the costs of a pairing additively depends on the time of the flights and on the (weighted) connection times. This is a relatively simplistic assumption since in the real world, the cost structure of a pairing is much more complex, see e.g. the paper (Atnunes et al. 2019) that was cited in the manuscript, where the cost relates to the maximum of three different values, including the guaranteed crew pay per duty.\n\nThe authors write that they use a column-generation-based solver to solve a set covering formulation of the CPP. Column generation, however, can only be used to solve the LP relaxation of this formulation. In order to solve the problem to optimality (as claimed in the paper), they need use a so-called branch-and-price algorithm which involves a lot of design decisions, and also the use of commercial LP and/or MIP solvers. This aspect, however, is not even mentioned in the paper. Also, in the experimental results section, this is not discussed, which means that the results are not reproducible at all. The paper does not even mention how long it takes to solve the problem. \n\nThe authors vaguely write that the subproblem they solve is a shortest path problem. Without further details, one would assume that we deal with a standard shortest path problem that is easy to solve. In realistic crew pairing settings, however, the subproblem is an NP-hard resource-constrained shortest path problem. Again, this aspect should be clarified.\n\nIt is not described in detail how the value r_ij enters the optimization process. While Fig. 1 would let us assume that the prediction model is only queried when needed, that does not make too much sense to me since it should be possible to compute all r_ij values for connections in advance.\n\nThe paper seems to completely ignore the fact that the minimum connection time for crews between two flights depends on the question whether the crew remains on the same aircraft or not. Usually, if the crew stays on the same aircraft, there is no minimum connection time at all. In particular, if a flight is delayed and the crew stays on the same aircraft, there is no risk of missing the connection (which is why airlines tend to disencourage aircraft changes of crews during a duty). This aspect should be definitely be discussed in the paper, since neglecting this aspect renders the whole analysis much less useful.\n\nThe paper only focuses on flight delays, and when solving the column generation subproblem, delay propagation is not considered at all. In addition, the paper neglects complex interactions between delays and crew regulations (e.g. a large total delay may render a duty invalid) and costs (which may involve so-called time away from base). For an example how a data-driven approach to crew pairing can account for these aspects, see e.g. the Transportation Science paper (Schaefer et. al. 2005)  \"Airline Crew Scheduling Under Uncertainty\".\n\nRegarding the experiments, all results are given for a single instance, and even that instance is not described very well. Only from the text I can try to infer that it deals with 243 flights, which, for real-world crew pairing is a  small-to-medium-sized problem. As mentioned above, other important aspects such as the cost structure of a pairing are not discussed.\n\nI find that the choice of alpha=2 for the \"nominal problem\" is somewhat arbitrary since choosing alpha>1 means that short (and thus non-robust) connections are favored. In practice, most airlines will use some way of penalizing high-risk connections, either relying on simple rules (that are certainly more complex that just a simple factor of the connection time), or on some data-driven quantitative model. If would have been interesting to see how the survival-based approach compares to a more standard ML approach for determining delay risk."

What is the algorithm you use for solving the pricing subproblem?\n\nPlease provide a more detailed description of the solution approach you use. How does the branch and price work?\nIn the experimental results, please tell us more about the hardware you run the experiments on, the solvers you use (if any), and regarding the solution time required; also if applicable the optimality gaps.\n\nIs there any reason to query the delay model during the solution of the CG subproblem instead of computing all r_ij values a priori?\n\nHow does your model account for (or could be extended to account for) different connection time requirements based on whether the crew changes aircraft?\n\nPlease provide a more detailed description of the instance: How many flights does it involve? Do you consider only a single crew base? \n\nI encourage you to run experiments with more instances to strengthen the evaluation of your approach.\n\nIn the appendix, you perform a sensitivity analysis regarding the total cost depending on alpha. For me, it would be very interesting to see how the total propagated delay in the simulation looks like for nominal solutions computed with different values of alpha.\n\nAlso, I would like to encourage you to test your approach against additional baselines, in particular to other approaches for choosing penality costs for risky connections."

The method is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset from Endeavor Air's 2019 operations under various scenarios, including regular and irregular operating conditions with varying levels of delay severity.

The paper does not explore how errors or uncertainties in reliability predictions might impact the overall optimization results and whether the method remains robust under less accurate predictions.\n- The simulation of delays may not capture the full complexity of delay propagation in airline networks, such as cascading effects and interactions between flights. This simplification could affect the validity of the simulation results and the observed performance improvements.\n- The paper does not report computational times or discuss the scalability of SurvCG in terms of solution time compared to the nominal approach.

Discuss any additional overhead introduced by the proposed approach and whether this overhead is acceptable in practical settings.\n- To demonstrate the generalizability of SurvCG, it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on datasets from multiple airlines, different regions, or more recent time periods.
