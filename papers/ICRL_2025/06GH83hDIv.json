    "title": "Auction-Based Regulation for Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "In an era of \"moving fast and breaking things\", regulators have moved slowly to pick up the safety, bias, and legal pieces left in the wake of broken Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment. Since AI models, such as large language models, are able to push misinformation and stoke division within our society, it is imperative for regulators to employ a framework that mitigates these dangers and ensures user safety. While there is much-warranted discussion about how to address the safety, bias, and legal woes of state-of-the-art AI models, the number of rigorous and realistic mathematical frameworks to regulate AI safety is lacking. We take on this challenge, proposing an auction-based regulatory mechanism that provably incentivizes model-building agents (i) to deploy safer models and (ii) to participate in the regulation process. We provably guarantee, via derived Nash Equilibria, that each participating agent's best strategy is to submit a model safer than a prescribed minimum-safety threshold. Empirical results show that our regulatory auction boosts safety and participation rates by 20% and 15% respectively, outperforming simple regulatory frameworks that merely enforce minimum safety standards.",

                "value": "Thank you to all the reviewers for their reviewing service and paper feedback. We are happy to see that the reviewers agree that we are working on an important research problem, that our paper is well-written, and that our theory-based approach is novel and promising.\n\nBelow, we provide additional empirical results that affirm our stated relationship between safety and cost on real-world data.\n\n## Ablation Study\n\n---\n\n- We conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that in realistic settings, safety is mapped to cost in a monotonically increasing way (as detailed in Assumption 2). \n \nWhile there are many factors to consider when gauging safe AI deployment, we analyze model fairness, via equalized odds, for image classification in this study. Equalized odds measures if different groups have similar true positive rates and false positive rates (lower is better).\n\n- We train VGG-16 models on the Fairface dataset [K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen 2019] for 50 epochs (repeated ten times with different random seeds), and consider a gender classification task with race as the sensitive attribute. \n\nModels with the largest validation classification accuracy during training are selected for testing. \n\n- Many types of costs exist for training safer models, such as extensive architecture and hyper-parameter search. In this study, we consider the cost of an agent acquiring more minority class data. \n\nThis leads to a larger and more balanced dataset. We simulate various mixtures of training data, starting from a 95:5 skew and scaling up to fully balanced training data with respect to the sensitive attribute. In our study, we gauge equalized odds performance on well-balanced test data for the models trained on various mixtures of data. Below we tabulate our results. \n\n| Minority Class % | Mean Equalized Odds Score | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| 5%     | 22.55     | \n| 10%     | 22.31     | \n| 15%     | 18.97     | \n| 20%     | 17.46     | \n| 25%     | 15.78    | \n| 30%     | 15.44     | \n| 35%     | 13.09     | \n| 40%     | 11.01     | \n| 45%     | 9.83     | \n| 50%     | 9.38     | \n\n- The equalized odds score decreases (the model becomes safer) when collecting more minority class data (increased cost). \n \nTo adjust equalized odds to fit into the setting where $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, one can invert and normalize the equalized odds score. We will upload a new version of our paper that includes this ablation study (with a scatter plot of the relationship between safety and cost shown in the table above). \n\n1.

The deployment and usage of AI models is often unchecked. Lax regulation of AI deployment has led to, and may further accelerate in the future, the proliferation of misinformation and harmful effects on society. We believe that our paper takes a big step towards a valuable societal goal of establishing an effective and mathematically-backed regulatory framework that governing bodies can implement. In summary, our paper contributes a novel mechanism to the area of AI regulation that:\n\n1. Formulates the regulatory process realistically as an auction, where there is one regulating body and many model-building agents.\n2. Leverages auction theory to derive equilibria such that rational agents are incentivized to both participate in the regulatory process and submit safer models.\n3. Empirically improves model safety by over 20% and participation rates by 15% compared to baseline regulatory mechanisms."

                "value": "Thank you, Reviewer Ft8N, for your insightful review of our paper. We appreciate that you found our work well-written, well-supported, and can help \"enhance the current AI regulatory work with a well-formulated framework and has a potential to have some significance in this domain\". Below, we address all questions you raised.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 1:** While the paper is well-supported in the mathematical formulation and proofs, it perhaps could have provided more evidence on the experiments and empirical data.\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:**\n- We have provided an additional ablation study within our Global Response that affirms the increasing relationship between safety and cost.\n\n\n> **Weakness 2:** More description of how this framework can be applied in AI regulatory or in practice might help ground it further and make it relevant to a wider group of audiences.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\n\n- The goal of this paper is to introduce a mathematically-based regulatory framework for incentivizing safer AI model deployment and detail (prove) its theoretical guarantees.\n- We dive into certain practical applications within Appendix D, namely extending SIRA to repeated regulatory auctions (which is realistic in practice).\n- We are working on a follow-up report that details how our framework can be applied in practice. \n\nWe believe, as the reviewer mentions, that our paper will be a launchpad to begin to \"explore and create safer and more robust AI regulatory\" frameworks. As a first step, we aimed to provide the theoretical backing of such a framework. In parallel, we are working on a policy-based report to implement an AI regulatory framework such as our own in practice. This report will focus more on the specific details surrounding implementation and less about the mathematical guarantees of SIRA.\n\n## Questions\n\n---\n\n> **Question 1:** What is the rationale of choosing the Beta and Uniform distribution (beyond what is described in line 323-324). Are there any related works that you could cite to support this choice of distributions?\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\n- Uniform distributions are commonly utilized to analyze all-pay auctions (as detailed in Lines 299-301) [Amann 1996; Bhaskar 2018; Tardos 2017].\n- We were interested in analyzing more than just a Uniform distribution (which is the usual choice for all-pay analysis), and the Beta distribution seems like a realistic choice in certain settings (as detailed in Lines 323-324).\n\n\n> **Question 2:** What is the scaling of complexity and cost (such as evaluation and communication) as the number of the agents increase? Are there any risks of agents colluding to achieve a suboptimal safety level?\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\n- Complexity and cost depends upon the size and bandwidth of the regulator.\n\nThere are examples of regulatory bodies that regulate a large number of products in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the FDA oversees approximately 2.1 Trillion dollars worth of food, tobacco, and medical products ([per its own numbers](https://www.fda.gov/media/168049/download)). Furthermore, the FDA has four approaches to speed-up the regulatory process for drug approval: Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Fast Track. That being said, budget cuts and a lack of resources can limit the number of products reviewed, and increase the review process length.\n\n- SIRA scales linearly if there are enough resources. \n\nAs long as there are enough people and resources to review submitted models, each submitted model can be analyzed by one regulatory agent."

                "value": "> **Weakness 4:** This issue could be exacerbated by the presence of open-source models like LLaMA, which may further incentivize the \"gaming\" of the regulatory system. Agents could enter the competition with low-cost variants of open-source models that prioritize safety at the expense of quality, primarily to secure the regulator\u2019s compensation. Put it in a different way, low-quality models (which are safe but not useful) could flood the regulatory system, making it easier to claim compensation without delivering valuable AI products. This could distort incentives, where participants optimize for regulatory approval rather than producing high-quality, well-rounded models.\n\n**Response to Weakness 4:**\n\nWe believe that our response to Weakness 3 clarifies our definition of safety and provides an answer to this Weakness.\n\n\n> **Weakness 5:** For the mechanism itself, a minor concern include the use of randomization, which introduces envy into the mechanism. With development costs potentially huge, this might lead to issues and discontent and distrust with the mechanism after the outcome is realized.\n\n**Response to Weakness 5:**\n\n- Performing the randomization process multiple times reduces the likelihood of unfair outcomes. \n\nIn practice, to avoid the possible unfair scenarios as detailed in the reviewer's question, we can repeat the randomization process $x$ times. For this to work, the regulator will store the number of times each agent has the higher safety bid $n_i$. Then, the regulator will award premium rewards to agents having value $n_i / x$ in the top half of all agents.\n\n\n## Questions\n\n---\n\n> **Question 1:** The framework assumes that the cost $M$ is the same across agents. This assumption seems unrealistic in practice, given that different agents may have varying models, training procedures, and resources, which makes the cost of aligning the safety levels different. If $M$ differs across agents, is there a way to adapt the framework to accommodate heterogeneous costs while maintaining its theoretical properties?\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\n- The motivation behind Assumption 2 is to generalize the relationship between safety and cost within the domain of AI regulation. \n\nIn general, safer models cost more to develop. We agree that there may be some slight discrepancies between agents regarding this relationship in certain settings. \n\n- As the first paper proposing a mathematically-based regulatory framework to incentivize safer model deployment within the AI regulatory domain, we believe that cost function discrepancies are secondary to the primary concern of developing frameworks to tackle AI safety regulation. \n \nAllowing personalized $M_i$ functions is an active line of research we are conducting for follow-up work.\n\n> **Question 2:** The paper didn't mention incentive compatibility, a key issue in auction literature. Is truthful report of $b_i$ guaranteed?\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\n\n- Truthfulness of $b_i$ is not a major issue within our mechanism since it is verified by the regulator (auctioneer) itself. \n- Each agent must provide the regulator access to its model in order to verify its safety level."

                "value": "Thank you, Reviewer F4Wy, for your insightful review of our paper. We appreciate that you found our line of work novel, theoretically sound, and well-written. Below, we address all questions you raised.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 1:** (Minor) The authors assume a fixed safety threshold, denoted as $\\epsilon$, for model development. While this may hold in domains such as drug approvals or medical equipment (as illustrated by the authors' N95 mask example), applying a similar framework to AI models is more challenging and complex.\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:**\n\n- Various safety metrics exist that can already be applied to gauge AI model safety (*e.g.,* F1 Score, human-annotated error rate, win rate, or attack success rate for LLMs).\n\n\nWhile complex and challenging, quantifying the safety of AI models is still feasible and necessary. Using current safety evaluation metrics is better than the alternative: zero safety regulation on deployed AI models. Furthermore, our framework is general enough such that when an improved method for evaluating AI model safety arises, it can immediately be used for the model evaluation process. \n\n\n> **Weakness 2:** (Minor) The model assumes that the test set used by regulators is drawn from the same distribution as the agent\u2019s evaluation data. However, in the specific context of language models, techniques such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can easily improve performance metrics if the evaluation distribution remains consistent. This weakens the argument that a single scalar value would sufficiently capture the intricacies of regulatory inspection.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\n\n- Techniques such as fine-tuning and RLHF add to agent costs (due to the need to collect more human/AI feedback and update the billions of parameters).\n\n\nWe agree that fine-tuning and RLHF can improve performance metrics. However, performing fine-tuning and RLHF incurs added cost. This is exactly what we model within our paper: increased safety necessitates increased cost. We believe that there may be some confusion surrounding the safety-metric function $\ud835\udc46$ and its application in model evaluation. The inputs of $S$ are the model parameters $w$ and evaluation data $x$. \n\n- In the example provided by the reviewer, fine-tuning or RLHF would result in a new set of parameters $w'$ such that $S(w';x) = \\epsilon' > S(w;x) = \\epsilon$.\n- There is added cost for an agent to find $w'$ via fine-tuning or RLHF: $M(\\epsilon') = p_{\\epsilon'} > M(\\epsilon) = p_{\\epsilon}$.\n\n\n> **Weakness 3:** The authors propose a strictly increasing relationship between safety and cost, arguing that \"safer models cost more to develop.\" However, they do not explicitly account for the trade-off between safety and the model's quality or usefulness in their framework. This omission raises questions, particularly since existing alignment approaches (e.g., RLHF) are often designed to balance helpfulness and harmlessness. In practice, a model could be made extremely safe (e.g., by providing only generic responses), but this could significantly reduce its usefulness without necessarily increasing development costs. In fact, under the authors' framework, one could submit a trivial model (e.g., one that always responds with \"Thank you for your input\"), bid the highest possible value, and meet the safety threshold  to claim the regulator's compensation. This suggests that achieving safety in some cases may not necessarily be costly unless the model\u2019s quality or usefulness is held constant.\n\n**Response to Weakness 3:**\n\n- Our regulatory framework holds for all AI models and not just LLMs.\n- Our definition of safety is much more general than determining if the output of the model is \"harmless\" or not.\n\nThe definition of safety that we use takes into account the usefulness of a model's output. For example, one may want to evaluate the F1 score of a model in order to ensure that it is minimizing the number of false positive and negative predictions (especially since false negative predictions can be very dangerous in healthcare settings). For LLMs, one may want to evaluate the attack success rate against submitted models on a benchmark such as [JailbreakBench](https://jailbreakbench.github.io) and/or assess the factuality of responses via human evaluation. As a result, an LLM that always responds \"Thank you for your input\" may be harmless, but it will fail to provide accurate responses and would be flagged for providing incorrect and unfactual responses by human evaluation. The evaluation metrics used to quantify safety are domain-specific and must incorporate evaluation of model quality. An active line of future research we are pursuing is determining which evaluations metrics are most effective across a variety of domains."

                "value": "## Questions\n\n---\n\n> **Question 1:** What is the technical challenge in the considered auction problem for AI models, compared to classic auction problems?\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\nWe answer this question in Weakness 2 above.\n\n> **Question 2:** Practical AI models are often very large. How can the safety of these model be evaluated? Given that the auction is done in a one shot setting, probably it is fine even if the model is large.\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\nWe answer this question in Weakness 1 above.\n\n> **Question 3:** I am more concerned about the compensation $v_i^p$, which needs to be provided by a regulator to implement the proposed auction algorithm. Why is this practical for existing AI models? How large does the compensation need to be? According to bidding equilibrium in Theorem 2, $v_i^p$ needs to be large for safer models. How could this be made up to compensate what the commercial AI models could achieve?\n\n**Response to Question 3:**\n- If a regulatory body and framework are established, all existing models would have to pass through them before continued use.\n\nAny existing models that do not meet the safety threshold would be barred from deployment (with the threat of governmental action). \n\n- Premium rewards provide incentive for agents that have existing models to make their model safer. \n\nFor example, if the premium reward is a tax credit coupled with fast-tracked model deployment, Google, for example, may try to bid such a safe model that it is cleared to be deployed faster than one of its rivals, say OpenAI. In this way, the premium rewards still provide incentive for the agents of existing models to train them to be even safer.\n\n- The size of the premium reward depends upon the monetary limits of the regulator.\n\nThe reviewer is correct that larger premium reward values $v_i^p$ correspond to the safer models submitted to the regulator (Theorem 2). As a result, the regulator should try to increase the value of its premium reward to be as large as possible. However, there is a limit to what regulators can offer agents. For example, regulators are not able to offer millions of dollars to each agent that builds a safe model. Thus, the value $v_i^p$ depends upon the monetary limits of the regulator."

Below, we address all questions you raised.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 1:** The way used by the paper to model the safety may not be realistic. It is assumed to be some safety level $s_i$ of a model $w_i$, which is expected to be less than $\\epsilon$. How is the safety measured for AI models using the metric mapping $S$ in practice? For common foundation models and LLMs, it might be hard to evaluate $S$ for $w_i$, especially given the size of $w_i$. What if a model provider take advantage of the inaccuracy of the safety evaluation to benefit itself?\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:**\n\n- The function $S$ is simply any metric that a regulator uses to gauge the safety performance $s_i$ of a model, represented by its parameters $w_i$ (*e.g.,* analyzing attack success rate on [JailbreakBench](https://jailbreakbench.github.io) for LLMs).\n\nWe believe there may be some confusion regarding the function $\ud835\udc46$ and its application in model evaluation.  In SIRA, agents will send their models to the regulator, who will gauge their safety levels using $S$.\n\n- $S$ determines the safety level $s_i$ of a model $w_i$, but does not relate safety to cost.\n\nConfusion may have arisen within the relationship between safety levels $s_i$ and agent costs. Within our paper, we assume that safety level $s_i$ is related to cost, via function $M$, in an increasing manner (*i.e.,* a larger safety level comes with an increasingly large cost). Thus, agents that desire a larger safety level $s_i$, determined by $S$, will have to pay more to attain it.\n\n> **Weakness 2:** The proposed auction algorithm, together with the theoretical results and analysis seem quite standard. How does it differ from the classic all-pay auction results (for instance, Amann et al. 1996) in the setting for AI models? It is worth highlighting the technical novelty and emphasize why the proposed method is needed for AI models, given that it is claimed in Line 398-399 that \"To the best of our knowledge there are no other comparable mechanisms for safety regulation in AI.\"\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\n\n- SIRA is specifically designed to mathematically formulate the AI regulation problem.\n- SIRA incorporates a reserve price (minimum safety bid required to win the deployment reward).\n- SIRA allocates multiple rewards to many ($n >> 2$) agents.\n- The derived agent utility (Equation 6) and derived equilibria in SIRA are novel and different than previous auction literature.\n\nWe want to thank the reviewer for allowing us to clarify, and more clearly detail within our paper, the technical novelty of SIRA compared to other all-pay auction works. The setting of our paper versus previous all-pay auction literature is starkly different. In previous literature (Amann 1996 for instance), the equilibrium of a two-player asymmetric all-pay auction is determined. There is only one winner and one reward, and there is no floor that the players must bid over in order to win their reward. In contrast, SIRA is the first to formulate the AI regulatory process as an auction. Thus, SIRA must account for **(i)** many more agents, **(ii)** a required safety level for model deployment, and **(iii)** multiple rewards available to the participating agents. As a result, the agent utility function in SIRA is much different than those in previous all-pay auction literature. Therefore, our theoretical analysis in deriving an equilibrium given this new utility is novel. Finally, we prove that SIRA spurs increased bids compared to other baselines in this domain that we ourselves formulated (Reserve Thresholding, Section 4)."

                "value": "> **Weakness 3:** Performance at high thresholds. As highlighted in the experiments, SIRA demonstrates limited advantages when safety thresholds approach the upper range (e.g., above 0.8), where its performance is similar to that of simpler reserve threshold models.\n\n**Response to Weakness 3:**\n\n- Reserve Thresholding (RT) is also a novel mechanism that we propose within our paper.\n- SIRA provably outperforms RT for bidding size and participation rate across *all* $\\epsilon$ ranges.\n- SIRA is a more realistic and robust framework, as it can be used across various settings where the $\\epsilon$ threshold can be vastly different.\n\n While SIRA empirically demonstrates limited advantages at the upper range of safety thresholds versus RT, it still provably improves the bidding size compared to RT (albeit small). Below, we compare the participation rate and bidding size between SIRA and RT (in the Uniform setting).\n\n| $\\epsilon$ Range | SIRA Participation | SIRA Bid | RT Participation | RT Bid  |\n| -------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | --------| \n| (0, 0.2)     | **86.273%**     |  **0.145**    | 85.352% | 0.105|\n| (0.2, 0.4)     | **61.788%**     | **0.358**  | 57.640%  | 0.305 |\n| (0.4, 0.6)     | **38.414%**     | **0.567**     | 30.402% |  0.505|\n| (0.6, 0.8)     | **15.514%**     | **0.753**     | 10.297% | 0.705 |\n| (0.8, 1.0)     | **1.633%**     | **0.903**     | 1.424% | 0.900 |\n\nAs expected from the results of our theory (Section 5), SIRA outperforms RT in participation rate and bid size across all $\\epsilon$ ranges. \n\n## Questions\n\n---\n\n> **Question 1:** Is there a reasonable mechanism for estimating the market value ($v_i^d$) of a model before it is submitted to the regulator or even before the training phase begins?\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\n- In Auction literature [Amann 1996; Bhaskar 2018; Tardos 2017], agent valuations are private and arise from nature; no mechanism estimates model deployment value. \n- It is realistic for many companies to place a market value on its own intellectual property and products.\n\nIn practice, these valuations are determined in house. For example, Google may perform market research to determine the value (revenue generation) of a model, like Gemini, before it is released. \n\n> **Question 2:** Considering that SIRA\u2019s performance deteriorates at high safety thresholds, would a simple increase in the threshold serve as a better incentive in such cases, as it may more directly encourage safer model development?\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\n\n- Increasing the threshold only discourages agents with lower total value $V_i$ from participating.\n\nAs one can see in Figures 2 & 3, raising the threshold results in lower participation (while the bids increase in size).\n\n- A straightforward method to incentivize safer model deployment would be to increase the premium reward.\n\nIncreasing the premium reward would shift the probability mass of total value $V_i$ towards 1 for agents. Consequently, more agents would have values closer to 1, which results in more agents willing to train a model that is able to clear the higher safety threshold.\n\n> **Question 3:** The authors mention that safety evaluations rely on IID assumptions for both agent and regulator data. How would the proposed mechanism adapt to non-IID settings, where the agent's training data might be maliciously poisoned, or where the regulator's evaluation data is collected through other means?\n\n**Response to Question 3:**\n- As detailed in our Future Work (Section 7), one possible solution is the requirement that data must be shared (in a private and anonymous manner) between each agent and the regulator. \n- Another possible solution would be the regulator collecting more data on its own (with possible assistance from agents). \n- The regulator can employ various defenses to mitigate malicious attacks (see response to Weakness 2).\n\n> **Question 4:** Is the random comparison fair for all competitive agents? For example, if we have utility values such that $u_A > u_B > u_C > u_D$, and A and B are grouped together while C and D are grouped together, then B and D cannot receive the policy bonus. However, since $u_B > u_C$, this situation could be considered unfair to B.\n\n**Response to Question 4:**\n\n- Performing the randomization process multiple times reduces the likelihood of unfair outcomes. \n\nIn practice, to avoid the possible unfair scenarios as detailed in the reviewer's question, we can repeat the randomization process $x$ times. For this to work, the regulator will store the number of times each agent has the higher safety bid $n_i$. Then, the regulator will award premium rewards to agents having value $n_i / x$ in the top half of all agents."

Below, we address all questions you raised.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 1:** Rationality of the auction framework. Considering the regulation process as an all-pay auction is not reasonable, at least in my opinion. Intuitively, safety-driven regulation establishes a minimum cost for the model-building agent. Every model-building agent must incur this cost, regardless of whether it can successfully meet the regulatory requirements. This represents an unavoidable exploration process within the model space. Even if we assume that all competitive agents know how to train their models to meet the safety threshold, accurately estimating the value of deployment remains a challenge. Thus, the framework may be overly simplistic in its approach to \"safety\" regulation.\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:**\n\n- We believe it is rational that there exists a minimum cost incurred by each model-building agent in order to have its model deployed. \n\nThis cost arises from placing effort into searching the model space for safe models. Simply put, **if a model is not safe enough to deploy, regardless of the cost incurred by the agent who built it, it should not be deployed.** As eloquently written in [Bengio et al. 2024]: \"Safety cases are politically viable even when people disagree on how advanced AI will become, since it is easier to demonstrate a system is safe when its capabilities are limited. Governments are not passive recipients of safety cases: they set risk thresholds, codify best practices, employ experts and thirdparty auditors to assess safety cases and conduct independent model evaluations, and hold developers liable if their safety claims are later falsified.\"\n\n- Our proposed regulatory framework provides a guide for a regulatory body to incentivize safe model development and deployment.\n\nIt is out of the scope of our work to detail how model-building agents incur the cost of safety training. In the case of LLMs, methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and fine-tuning allow agents to make their models safer. \n\n1. Yoshua Bengio et. al. Managing extreme AI risks amid rapid progress, 2024.\n\n> **Weakness 2:** Feasibility of Assumptions 1 and 2. Assumption 1 fails when a model-building agent maliciously injects backdoor triggers into the model by altering the training dataset. Assumption 2 is also not straightforward. More cost (e.g., computational resources) does not necessarily equate to better safety. Safety also depends on other factors, such as the learning paradigm, model architecture, loss function design, and hyperparameter selection.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\n\n- The regulator can use various defenses [Goldblum 2022; Zhao 2024; Gao 2020] to mitigate a wide variety of attacks, including backdoor attacks.\n- Defending against malicious attacks falls out of the scope of our proposed framework.\n\n**Remark:** The goal of our paper is to provide the first mathematically-based regulatory framework to incentivize safer model deployment within the AI regulatory domain. Defending against maliciously-submitted models is an interesting and important future line of work.\n\n- There is a cost associated with exploring various design factors, including the learning paradigm, model architecture, loss function design, and hyperparameter selection.\n\nIn the examples provided by the reviewer, we agree that the learning paradigm, model architecture, loss function design, and hyperparameter selection do affect safety. However, there is a cost to investigate each of these provided examples. As a result, these all fall under \"cost\". Determining a relationship between cost and each one of these factors requires a detailed analysis that falls out of the scope of the paper.\n\n2. Goldblum, Micah, et al.

In this framework, agents submit their models to a regulator, and those that meet or exceed a specified safety level become eligible for deployment and may also receive additional rewards based on the randomized pair comparison result. The authors theoretically prove that under some assumptions and when all agents adopt a certain strategy, the system reaches a Nash Equilibrium. Empirical results indicate that when safety threshold prices are in the middle (0.2~0.8), SIRA enhances safety compliance and agent participation by 20% and 15%, respectively compared with the basic regulatory method."

While this may hold in domains such as drug approvals or medical equipment (as illustrated by the authors' N95 mask example), applying a similar framework to AI models is more challenging and complex.\n- (Minor) The model assumes that the test set used by regulators is drawn from the same distribution as the agent\u2019s evaluation data. However, in the specific context of language models, techniques such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can easily improve performance metrics if the evaluation distribution remains consistent. This weakens the argument that a single scalar value would sufficiently capture the intricacies of regulatory inspection.\n- The authors propose a strictly increasing relationship between safety and cost, arguing that \"safer models cost more to develop.\" However, they do not explicitly account for the trade-off between safety and the model's quality or usefulness in their framework. This omission raises questions, particularly since existing alignment approaches (e.g., RLHF) are often designed to balance helpfulness and harmlessness. In practice, a model could be made extremely safe (e.g., by providing only generic responses), but this could significantly reduce its usefulness without necessarily increasing development costs. In fact, under the authors' framework, one could submit a trivial model (e.g., one that always responds with \"Thank you for your input\"), bid the highest possible value, and meet the safety threshold $\\epsilon$ to claim the regulator's compensation. This suggests that achieving safety in some cases may not necessarily be costly unless the model\u2019s quality or usefulness is held constant.\n- This issue could be exacerbated by the presence of open-source models like LLaMA, which may further incentivize the \"gaming\" of the regulatory system. Agents could enter the competition with low-cost variants of open-source models that prioritize safety at the expense of quality, primarily to secure the regulator\u2019s compensation. Put it in a different way, low-quality models (which are safe but not useful) could flood the regulatory system, making it easier to claim compensation without delivering valuable AI products. This could distort incentives, where participants optimize for regulatory approval rather than producing high-quality, well-rounded models.\n\nFor the mechanism itself, a minor concern include the use of randomization, which introduces envy into the mechanism. With development costs potentially huge, this might lead to issues and discontent and distrust with the mechanism after the outcome is realized."
