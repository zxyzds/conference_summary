    "abstract": "We explore brokerage between traders in an online learning framework.\nAt any round $t$, two traders meet to exchange an asset, provided the exchange is mutually beneficial.\nThe broker proposes a trading price, and each trader tries to sell their asset or buy the asset from the other party, depending on whether the price is higher or lower than their private valuations.\nA trade happens if one trader is willing to sell and the other is willing to buy at the proposed price.\nPrevious work provided guidance to a broker aiming at enhancing traders' total earnings by maximizing the _gain from trade_, defined as the sum of the traders' net utilities after each interaction.\nThis classical notion of reward can be highly unfair to traders with small profit margins, and far from the real-life utility of the broker.\nFor these reasons, we investigate how the broker should behave to maximize the trading volume, i.e., the _total number of trades_.\nWe model the traders' valuations as an i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution.\nIf the traders' valuations are revealed after each interaction (full-feedback), and the traders' valuations cumulative distribution function (cdf) is continuous, we provide an algorithm achieving logarithmic regret and show its optimality up to constants.\nIf only their willingness to sell or buy at the proposed price is revealed after each interaction ($2$-bit feedback), we provide an algorithm achieving poly-logarithmic regret when the traders' valuations cdf is Lipschitz and show its near-optimality.\nWe complement our results by analyzing the implications of dropping the regularity assumptions on the unknown traders' valuations cdf. \nIf we drop the continuous cdf assumption, the regret rate degrades to $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ in the full-feedback case, where $T$ is the time horizon. \nIf we drop the Lipschitz cdf assumption, learning becomes impossible in the $2$-bit feedback case.",

                "value": "The paper studies a online learning problem for the brokerage who aims to maximize the total trading volume by posting a single price to two sequentially arriving traders. In particular, at each round $t$, there are two traders arriving with their private valuations $V_{2t-1}$ and $V_{2t}$. The broker then posts a price $P_t$ for this round, and if this price $P_t$ is between $V_{2t-1} \\vee V_{2t}$ and $V_{2t-1} \\wedge V_{2t}$, then the trade happens. \nInstead of optimizing the total gain from trade discussed in previous works, the goal of the brokerage of this work is to maximizing the total trading volume \u2014 i.e., the total expected trading probability. \n\nThe paper assumes that the two valuations of both traders are all independently and identically realized from an unknown distribution. The paper considers two feedback structure. One is full feedback where the brokerage can observe both traders\u2019 valuations $V_{2t-1}, V_{2t}$, another is the 2-bit feedback where the brokerage can only observe indicators $\\mathbb{I}\\{V_{2t-1}\\le P_t\\}$ and $\\mathbb{I}\\{V_{2t}\\le P_t\\}$.\n\nThe paper first shows that in the full-feedback case, if the distribution of the traders\u2019 valuations has a continuous cdf, then an $O(\\ln T)$-regret algorithm exists and this is tight. They also show that if we dropthe continuous cdf assumption, then the regret degrades to $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$, and they also provide an algorithm for this regret bound. \n\nIn the 2-bit feedback case, if the cdf of the traders\u2019 valuations is M -Lipschitz, they show that  $O(\\ln(MT)\\lnT)$-regret algorithm exists and also provide a near-matching lower bound $O(\\ln(MT))$. The problem becomes becomes unlearnable if one drop the Lipschitzness assumption."

The new metric measures the expected probability of a successful trade which is motivated by a fairness concern: ``trading-volume maximization gives the same dignity to all traders, granting everybody the same opportunity to trade, independently of their buying power\u2019\u2019. I think taking a step to study the fairness issue in bilateral trade has solid motivation. The paper also provides complete results for this problem (though making some simplifying assumptions)."

How does metric compared to the metric that is related trader\u2019s welfare? I think more discussions here may be helpful to better motivate the current metric. \n\nMeanwhile, I think the current results are bit restricted given that they assume both traders\u2019 valuations are all realized from a same distribution. This assumption seems to be a bit unpractical in real-world. Would current results/algorithms generalize to this setting?"

                "value": "The paper studies trade volume maximization in brokerages through an online learning perspective. It considers bilateral trades where in each round two traders participate. The brokerage sets a price $p_t$, and the traders independently sample a private valuation from a fixed distribution. The trade happens if the brokerage price is between the two traders' sampled valuations, that is one trader values it below the price and is willing to sell it at this price, and one trader values it more than the price and is willing to buy at the price.\n\nPrevious works consider regret minimization aiming to maximize total profits, but this paper introduces a new objective where the goal of the brokerage is to maximize the number of trades. \n\nThe authors motivate the objective by showing an example where profit maximization can lead to low trade volumes.  \n\nThey consider full feedback setting and partial feedback setting. \n\nFor the full feedback setting, they show that having continuous CDF is enough to get $O(\\ln T)$ regret upper bound. In contrast, for the profit maximization setting, prior work has shown that Lipschitzness of the CDF is required to achieve even $\\tilde{O}(T)$ upper bounds. They also show a matching lower bound. For the non-continuous case, they show a $O(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bound and give an algorithm that achieves a matching upper bound. \n\nFor the partial feedback, the brokerage only learns if the valuations were lower or higher than the price. Under $M$ Lipschitzness of the CDF, the authors give an algorithm with $O(\\ln(MT) \\ln T)$ upper bound and show an $ \\Omega( \\ln(MT))$ lower bound. They also show that Lipschitzness is required to obtain sublinear regret in the partial feedback case."

Even though the authors motivate the trading volume objective, I would also benefit from some discussion on the potential drawbacks of aiming for trading volume maximization.

Most insights and algorithms are based on the fact that trade volume is maximized at the median in the i.i.d. setting where buyers and sellers have the same valuation distribution. Thus, the techniques may not translate to the generally studied i.i.d setting where the buyer and seller have different and possibly correlated distributions. The authors mention it as a possible future work, but maybe they can motivate the i.i.d setting more."

Specifically, the authors consider a setting where, at each time step, a buyer and a seller arrive, and the algorithm, acting as the broker, needs to decide on a price for the trade. The trade is successful if the buyer's value is higher than the price, and the seller's value is lower than the price. Unlike prior works on bilateral trade that focused on optimizing **gain from trade**, the authors study the problem under a new measure of performance: **total number of trades**. The buyer's and the seller's values are drawn from an unknown distribution i.i.d. at each time step. The authors study two models of the algorithm's observation: after each time step, it observes either both players' values or their willingness to sell or buy at each time step. Under both models, and under different assumptions on the distribution of the values, the authors provide algorithms with guarantees on their regret and lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm. In most cases, the regret guarantees and lower bounds match each other asymptotically."
