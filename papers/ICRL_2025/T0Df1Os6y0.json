    "title": "LossAgent: Towards Any Optimization Objectives for Image Processing with LLM Agents",
    "abstract": "We present the first embodied loss agent, dubbed LossAgent, for low-level image processing tasks, e.g., image super-resolution and restoration, intending to achieve any customized optimization objectives of low-level image processing in different practical applications. Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss. which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the embodied loss agent, where the rich textual understanding prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent.",

                "value": "In this work, an LLM-Agent-like mechanism is proposed to determine optimal weights of multiple differentiable loss functions for low-level image processing tasks. Specifically, the authors first set up a set of differentiable loss functions. Afterwards, they introduce a well-crafted prompt that consists of a system prompt, external feedback, and customized needs. By passing this structured prompt through an LLM, the system outputs optimal loss weights, effectively integrating both differentiable and non-differentiable information into the optimization process. Experiments are mainly conducted on three low-level image processing tasks with three common losses."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "However, there are several weaknesses as follows:\n\n1. The scope of this work is limited to only three low-level image processing tasks with just three common losses. Furthermore, the losses are combined using a simple weighted approach. To enhance the contribution of this work, it would be beneficial to explore the LossAgent's performance on a broader range of tasks with a more diverse set of loss functions and combination strategies.\n\n2. A thorough analysis of the loss weights is missing, including their initialization and constraints to ensure the values range from 0 to 1. The paper should provide details on how these weights are initialized and managed throughout the optimization process.\n\n3. The use of test images for external feedback generation at the end of each stage raises concerns about overfitting. It would be more appropriate to use images from a validation set rather than the test set. Additionally, using the same metric for both external expert evaluation and final loss assessment may lead to bias towards that specific metric. To address these issues and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, the authors should: 1) Use a separate validation set for external feedback generation; 2) Employ diverse external experts that are distinct from the final evaluation metrics; 3) Demonstrate how all metrics change when optimizing for single, double, and textual objectives.\n\n4. The baseline results in Table 2 are presented with fixed loss weights. It's unclear whether these fixed weights are the same as the initial loss weights or how they were determined. Moreover, the authors don't provide information on how they ensured these weights are optimal for each task.\n\n5. The results shown in Tables 4 and 5 fail to provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method, as they show only marginal improvements or, in some cases, even inferior performance compared to baselines. The evaluation is limited to optimizing only one or two objectives, which raises questions about the method's scalability and efficacy when dealing with more objectives. A more comprehensive assessment would involve testing the proposed LossAgent in multi-objective optimization contexts, incorporating both quantitative metrics and qualitative textual descriptions."

However, this paper is never cited or discussed. \n\n    [R1] Large Language Models as Optimizers\n\n2. **The classification criteria is wrong**. This manuscript uses the differentiability of a metric as the judgment of being loss / objective. However, as studied in [R1], the problem is not differentiability. Many non-reference IQA metrics are differentiable (including some metrics used in this manuscript), but directly optimizing these non-reference IQA metrics will cause quite poor image quality. A metric is differentiable does not mean it can serve as a loss. Therefore, whether a metric can serve as the loss to improve the quality (instead of differentiability) should be the judgment of being loss / objective.\n\n    [R2] Comparison of No-Reference Image Quality Models via MAP Estimation in Diffusion Latents \n\n3. **The relationship between losses and metrics is not analyzed**. This manuscript aims to bridge some unoptimizable metrics and optimizable losses. What are the results of the bridge? Are there some connections between unoptimizable metrics and optimizable losses? \n\n4. **Confusing formulas and no explanation of loss selection**. In Sec. 4, only the objective metrics are given, while the multiple differentiable losses are not given. How many losses does this manuscript use? What is L1, L2, L3, \u2026, respectively? These are all quite important information, but they are never clearly described. I can only find them in Tab. 1 with only abstract formulas and without detailed explanations. For example, in the third row of Tab. 1 (All-in-one IR), there are $L_{perceptual}$ and $L_{LPIPS}$, what is the difference between them? In my view, they are the same. If they are different, which perceptual loss does this manuscript use? Also, why use L1 loss instead of MSE loss?\n\n5. **Missing information and the necessity of double optimization objectives is not enough**. In Tab. 5, what are the metrics are not stated. I can only guess through the description of Sec 4.2.2 that the metrics are Q-Align / PSNR. In this case, MSE loss (same as PSNR) is differentiable, so why use an LLM to optimize PSNR instead of directly optimizing MSE? Will using an LLM to judge PSNR bring better results than optimizing MSE? \n\n6. **Conclusion of double optimization objectives is not convincing**. In Tab. 5, the experiment is conducted on the classical image SR task whose losses contain L1 loss. Given PSNR results, LLM can increase PSNR results easily by increasing the weight of L1 loss. In this case, the experiment can only show LLM can link PSNR with L1 loss, which is very easy. What is the meaning of this experiment? \n\n7. In Fig. 3, there is a clear advantage of LossAgent over baseline only for the third case (CLIPIQA). \n\n8. Writing.\n- In Tab. 3, the upper arrows of MANIQA and CLIPIQA are mixed.\n- In Tab. 7, the \u201cW\u201d in the caption should be \u201cw/\u201d."
