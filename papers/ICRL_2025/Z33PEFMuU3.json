    "abstract": "Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process,\ntreating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural\ninformation in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic\ndiffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model\nthat is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In\nparticular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edgepreserving\nand isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model\u2019s generative\nprocess converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution.\nWe demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the\ndataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information.\nOur edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative\ntasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We\npresent qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID\nscore) of up to 30% for both tasks.",

Suggesting comparisons with existing methods on these metrics could provide valuable context. For instance, a table comparing memory usage and speed (inference and training) across baseline models could highlight this model's practical viability more clearly.\n\n2. While the paper demonstrates improvements on a specific dataset, it is unclear how well the model generalizes to other types of models or tasks. Testing on tasks that emphasize diverse structural features, such as denoising or inpainting, could provide insight into how well the model maintains performance across broader applications.\n\n3. The current evaluation uses limited metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Including newer metrics like CLIPScore, etc. could provide a more comprehensive view of performance. Specifically, CLIPScore could offer insights into the model's ability to generate semantically consistent images. Given the model's edge-preserving focus, metrics that capture detail preservation and structure alignment might also be beneficial.\n\n4. While the paper compares the proposed method with existing baselines, it could benefit from a more detailed comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art methods, especially those that also aim to preserve structural information in images.\n\n5. The performance of the proposed model may be highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the transition function and edge sensitivity. The paper could provide **more insight** into how these parameters affect the model's performance and **how to select** them effectively."

                "value": "1. Does edge-aware noise affect generation diversity?\n2. In the \"Related Work\" section, you initially describe IHDM as an isotropic Gaussian blurring model, yet later refer to it and BNDM as incorporating a form of non-isotropic noise. This creates a seeming contradiction that would benefit from further clarification to ensure the logical coherence of your manuscript.\n3. While the paper makes a commendable effort to integrate the anisotropic diffusion concept from Perona and Malik (1990) into the diffusion model framework, the innovation appears to be primarily an application of existing theory rather than a novel theoretical contribution. The incorporation of edge-preserving noise as a new term in the diffusion process, while potentially enhancing the model's performance in certain aspects, does not fundamentally alter the underlying principles of generative diffusion models.\n4. The discussion surrounding Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) in the paper is somewhat perplexing due to its circuitous approach. The authors explore the relationship between diffusion models and heat conduction, as well as the limitations of isotropic noise, before returning to the contributions of Perona and Malik (1990) in Eq. (10). A more effective strategy would be to engage with Perona and Malik's work on edge-preserving diffusion earlier in the discussion. This would create a natural transition to Eq. (12), which introduces the paper's core innovation\u2014a novel noise term.\n5. In the \"Background\" section, when discussing the \"Forward and backward process posteriors,\" you utilize the formulation presented in Eq. (1), which is consistent with the isotropic Gaussian process. However, you also reference Eq. (2), which is derived from the heat dissipation process and represents a different formulation. My concern is that the use of both Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) in this context may create confusion, especially since your novel edge-preserving noise scheme seems to be more aligned with the principles of Eq. (1), as inferred from the derivations in Section 4.2. It appears that your improved noise term is inspired by the anisotropic diffusion work of Perona and Malik, which is more closely related to Eq. (2). Yet, the parameter calculations and posterior calculations in your model follow a form similar to Eq. (1). If this is the case, then the inclusion of Eq. (2) in the introduction might be seen as unnecessary, and it could potentially detract from the clarity of your paper. I would recommend either providing a more explicit connection between your noise model and Eq. (2), or if Eq. (2) is not central to your approach, consider streamlining the presentation to focus on Eq. (1) and its relevance to your edge-preserving noise scheme. This would help readers to better understand the relationship between your work and the existing literature and clarify why both equations are presented if they are not both integral to your model."
