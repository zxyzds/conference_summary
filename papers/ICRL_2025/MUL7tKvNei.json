    "abstract": "Learning the evolutionary dynamics of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is critical in understanding dynamic systems, yet current methods insufficiently learn their representations. This is largely due to the multi-scale nature of the solution, where certain regions exhibit rapid oscillations while others evolve more slowly. This paper introduces a framework of multi-scale and multi-expert (M$^2$M) neural operators designed to simulate and learn PDEs efficiently. We employ a divide-and-conquer strategy to train a multi-expert gated network for the dynamic router policy. Our method incorporates a controllable prior gating mechanism that determines the selection rights of experts, enhancing the model's efficiency.  To optimize the learning process, we have implemented a PI (Proportional, Integral) control strategy to adjust the allocation rules precisely. This universal controllable approach allows the model to achieve greater accuracy. We test our approach on benchmark 2D Navier-Stokes equations and provide a custom multi-scale dataset. M$^2$M can achieve higher simulation accuracy and offer improved interpretability compared to baseline methods.",

                "value": "The paper, M2M...,introduces Multi-Scale and Multi-Expert neural operators, designed to simulate PDEs efficiently. The authors propose  using domain specific expert models and a divide-and-conquer strategy combined with a controllable gating mechanism that determines the allocation of computational resources across models. \nThe use of multiple models and the PI control strategy is innovative over standard approaches. The approach appears fresh compared to existing methods like FNO, UNO, and CNO. However, while the experimental evidence is strong, the theoretical underpinnings and the scope of generalizability could be expanded. A deeper critical evaluation of assumptions and additional testing across diverse conditions would enhance its impact.  Specifically in combining domain local solutions, considerations on boundary conditions is very critical. In multi-scale and divide-and-conquer approaches, ensuring smooth and consistent transitions between patches is critical, particularly when different models are used.  These issues are not discussed in the paper.  \nThe dynamic allocation mechanism, while innovative, might oversimplify the complexities of real-world PDEs. The M2M framework introduces considerable architectural complexity, including multiple models, a dynamic router, and a control mechanism. While this complexity is justified in the paper as necessary for handling multi-scale problems efficiently, there is limited discussion on the practical implications, such as computational cost, scalability, and ease of implementation.\nThe experiments focus on a few benchmark datasets, such as custom multi-scale and Navier-Stokes simulations. While these examples are relevant, the paper does not test the model on a wider variety of PDEs or real-world scenarios that could demonstrate claims on generalizability.\nAdditionally the discussions in section 6. 5. on the error dynamics of the PID control related discussions is mathematically inconsistent.  Specifically \nSection 4. COMBINED DYNAMICS AND STABILITY has the combined error dynamics defined such that de/dt = -u(t), this and other developments are inconsistent and incorrect with respect to control and system dynamics.\nOverall I think the paper needs more work and theoretical development to provide convincing arguments toward soundness of the proposed solution."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Motivation: The motivation is not presented well. The authors fail to adequately situate their approach within the existing body of literature. E.g. in line 14 \"current methods insufficiently learn their representations\" is not supported by examples or according literature. In line 50 it is claimed that \"Exploring how to integrate and fully leverage performance across different scales while controlling complex learning dynamics is a promising area of research\", however a reference or argumentation supporting the claim is missing. \nIn section 2, autoregressive and neural operators are presented as two different approaches, however the authors do not clearly position their method within both. In line 154, the authors claim \u201cHowever, the aforementioned methods do not efficiently leverage frequency characteristics, and they lack a controllable mechanism for adjusting the learning process of partial differential equations.\u201d, which is not supported by citations, experiments or further arguments. Please provide specific examples or citations from the literature that demonstrate the limitations of current methods in learning representations of multi-scale PDEs. Furthermore, references or a brief discussion of existing work on multi-scale modeling including connecntions to the proposed approach would better support their claim about the promise of this research direction and provide more structure in the literature review. \n\nResults: The method does not increase the prediction quality for the Navier Stokes data set compared to the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) (line  448: \"Specifically, M2M outperforms the strong baseline of FNO128 in the performance a little.\"), which is not significant enough to support that this is achieved by the architecture design of the method. A more detailed discussion (especially on hyperparameter tuning) is missing.\n\n\nThe custom dataset: The custom dataset consists of fields of 4 squares with different dynamics. The proposed methodology seems to segment this in 16 squares, inducing an alignment of these squares. This is most probable not a fair comparison as 1) in physics, such quadratically structures field do not exist and 2) the alignment of dataset segments and segments that are distributed within the method induce an unfair bias to this method being superior. Experiments on publicly available datasets would provide a fairer evaluation. Usage of e.g. the PDEBench from the University of Stuttgart should be considered. \n\nUnsupported claims: E.g. Contribution 2, Line 97 \u201cBy bridging the control theory-PID, this unified theory demonstrates its strong generalizability. It is a versatile and scalable method for the machine learning and science simulation community. \u201c The method is only validated for two different datasets, and a reason why PID controller integration unifies a theory is not given. \nE.g. in line 442 \"As shown in table 4.2, our M2M can allocate high  FNO modes to the high-frequency region\" - but table 4.2 does not show this. To provide evidence on the claim of generalizability more corresponding experiments (see comment w.r.t. to datasets above) should be added. Moreover, a more detailed discussion and analysis on how the PID controller integration contributes to the method's generalizability and versatility should be added, e.g. how do the distinct controller parts (P, I and D contribute). \n\nClarity: The explanation of expert nets in Line 191-193 is too short and thus hard to understandable in the current status. This section should be detailed to describe the function and concept of the expert nets. Moreover, the aggregation function in eq. 6 is should be specified. Also, a more detailed discussion on the routing should be added since it is hard to follow currently. The same holds for the explanation of PI control (252, 253).  Algorithm 1 is described very imprecisely and uses not introduced variable names. According symbols and variables should be introduced and explained. \n\nDistinction between the method presentation and its parametrization for the application is not given; this raises confusion about how the model is later used, e.g. starting in line 179, 4 patches are used, and then again n in equation 5, and then again 4 in line 219.\n\nGraphics and tables with error metrics and terms that are not introduced/explained: e.g. caption of Figure 3 (\u201cscale is set to 4\u201d, how is the error metric defined), Figure 4 (\u201cPrior [0000]\u201d, \u201cTOP_k\u201d, how is the expert specified), Figure 5 (scale again, values plotted are not described, graphics quality is poor), Table 1 (what does the subsets mean). \n\nSubmitted source code is not usable: The required Python environment is not specified, there is no explanation how to use models and how to get datasets, all comments are Chinese such that they are not understandable to the worldwide community. Please provide a description or HowTo specifying the Python environment, including instructions for using the models and obtaining datasets, and translate comments to English to make the code accessible to a wider audience.\n\nMathematical notation unclear: use of introduced subsets (N, M, equation 6), in line 235 x misses the subscript, use of same variable for different things (e.g. x in line 107 and 222), not clear where equation 7 is used, meaning of variables in equation 10 is not clear.\n\nMisleading introduction of PI control: The authors claim that they have a proof for the application of PI control in their method and link to the appendix. But what is claimed to be a proof is not a proof, but an introduction to PID control that can be found in many teaching books. Furthermore, intensified by the not defined error metric used in Figure 3, it remains unclear if the realized convergence increase is due to a different scaling of the components of the loss function, or a real benefit. Anyhow, to achieve the best result in Figure 3, both models still need to be trained for the same number of epochs. Additionally, the authors mismatch feedback and reference in line 297 and are not clear about what they control with PI (KL or loss?)\n\nPaper quality: Grammar, sentence structure and spelling are frequently faulty. It seems that the quality of explanations, language and presentation gradually degrades to the end of the paper.\n\nI think the paper introduces too many new elements of a model structure, such that the implications of the single changes cannot be separated. Here an ablation study should be added.\n\nImportant parts of results are in the appendix, as well as the limitations. This should be fixed.\n\nMinor points:\n\nThe first two sentences in the abstract are missing arguments or citations which prove the statement \u201cLearning the evolutionary dynamics of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is critical in understanding dynamic systems, yet current methods insufficiently learn their representations. This is largely due to the multi-scale nature of the solution, where certain regions exhibit rapid oscillations while others evolve more slowly.\u201d\n\u2022\tThe meaning of M2M is not explained.\n\u2022\tContribution 3, line 99, is not a real contribution as validation is a must in machine learning papers \u201cWe validate the aforementioned method using the standard Navier-Stokes equations and a custom multi-scale dataset, \u2026\u201d\n\u2022\tFNO-3D allows for zero shot super resolution, while your approach does not. This should be mentioned.\n\u2022\tThe title of 4.1 is not exact.\n\u2022\tThe numbering in the appendix is wrong; it should start with letters."
