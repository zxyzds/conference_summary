    "title": "CogniPair - Dynamic LLM Matching Algorithm in Chaotic Environments Mimicking Human Cognitive Processes for Relationship Pairing",
    "abstract": "Dating applications in the digital era have transformed how people connect, yet they often fall short in simulating the comprehensive character and fostering truly compatible relationships due to their reliance on quantitative data. This paper proposes a novel framework to simulate human characters by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance matchmaking by understanding the nuanced fabric of human personality and social connections. Traditional algorithms often lack the depth needed for personalized matchmaking, whereas LLMs offer sophisticated linguistic and cognitive capabilities to simulate a person and complicated personal decisions. Our framework introduces a multi-agent system comprising the Persona, Preference, and Dating Memory modules, allowing for dynamic and nuanced user interactions. This approach addresses the limitations of conventional LLM frameworks by capturing detailed personal attributes, updating preferences, and learning from past interactions. Our system enhances the relevance and effectiveness of match recommendations, focusing on emotional compatibility and shared values, providing a more personalized and responsive user experience in the dating domain.",

                "value": "The paper proposes CogniPair, a matchmaking framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for simulating human cognitive processes in pairing relationships within dating applications. It presents a modular architecture with sub-agents, including the Persona, Preference, Reflection, and Dating Memory modules, designed to enhance matchmaking through simulations of human-like decision-making and learning based on past interactions. Experiments include simulations with a small dataset using GPT-4 and comparisons against baseline methods."

                "value": "1. Critical implementation specifics, such as the prompting process for each sub-agent module, remain ambiguous. Further, there is insufficient information on Dating Memory Modules and how it updates the Reflection Module. \n2. The experiments are confined to a small dataset from a speed-dating event with only 10 participants per gender, of the same age range, within the same environment. The generalizability of the results is questionable, as the dataset is insufficient to capture the complexities of diverse real-world dating preferences and settings.\n3. The system's evaluation metrics (e.g., dialogue realism, character authenticity) rely heavily on subjective human ratings rather than objective, real-world testing on a dating app platform.\n4. The paper claims that the Cognitive Matching and Reflection Modules capture emotional compatibility, yet the empirical evidence (DRS and SCA scores) suggest the opposite."

This would be help with reproducibility and provide a better understanding of the CogniPair system. \n2. How would you address the limitations of the small dataset, and possibly extend it more diverse dating settings?\n3. The paper would benefit if some examples outputs from the CogniPair's matchmaking are included.\n4. Can you explain how the Cognitive Matching and Reflection Modules capture emotional compatibility, possibly through example outputs? Furthermore, how do you explain the discrepancy with the empirical evidence showing a lack of human emotion understanding?"

There is no formal presentation of the framework's modules. Furthermore, how these are interconnected and interoperable is not discussed. This trend extends to all key sections: the data preprocessing step is unclear and ambiguous, the sub-agent architecture is superficially discussed and not detailed, and the interaction/decision process is not adequately described.\n- The experimental section is verbose and definitely unclear: the authors first present an existing dataset (i.e., Speed Dating Experiment) for simulating behaviors, then introduce real-life interactions based on (only) 20 participants, plus simulated dialogues to compare the reliability. The experimental setup is also heavily fragmented and not adequately discussed. The assessment criteria are not properly contextualized (just summarized in a table in the Appendix). \n- Shown results turn out to be poor and no comparison with baseline or competing methods is shown.\n- The presentation of this manuscript has much room for improvement. Papers are cited by their title (see rows 114 and 130), figures are not properly readable, phrases are repeated multiple times, and the overall discussion is verbose, requiring proofreading and massive rephrasing.\n- The participants' recruitment and data treatment is not discussed at all and must be properly detailed."

How were their interactions recorded and handled?\n- Why do the authors rely only on GPT-4 rather than experiment also with other models?\n- What are male_id, female_id? Are these from the Speed Dating dataset?"

Does this limit the data size?\n3.\tThe detailed parameters of the dataset are not listed, so it is impossible to see the impact of data sparsity on the model.\n4.\tToo few bench lines. There are only three bench lines. It is recommended to add more results from the past three years to reflect the superiority of the method proposed in the article.\n5.\tRegarding the accuracy of matching decisions, please explain why ACC and TPR are chosen.\n6.\tThere are no method formulas in the whole article, which makes all the method details in the article unclear. I hope to show the specific method flow through some formulas.\n7.\tThe experiment is weak. There is no ablation experiment to prove the effectiveness of the reflection module and the dating memory module, and there is no experiment to discuss the optimal number of dialogue iterations, etc. More experiments are needed to illustrate the necessity and performance of the module."
