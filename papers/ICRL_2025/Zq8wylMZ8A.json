    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have excelled across a wide range of tasks, but their use in high-stakes and compute-limited settings has intensified the demand for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by proposing Induction-head ngram models (Induction-Gram), a method that builds an efficient, interpretable LM by bolstering modern ngram models with a hand-engineered ``induction head''. This induction head uses a custom neural similarity metric to efficiently search the model's input context for potential next-word completions. This process enables Induction-Gram to provide ngram-level grounding for each generated token. Moreover, experiments show that this simple method significantly improves next-word prediction over baseline interpretable models (up to 26%p) and can be used to speed up LLM inference for large models through speculative decoding. We further study Induction-Gram in a natural-language neuroscience setting, where the goal is to predict the next fMRI response in a sequence. It again provides a significant improvement over interpretable models (20% relative increase in the correlation of predicted fMRI responses), potentially enabling deeper scientific investigation of language selectivity in the brain.",

The paper also involves a downsteram evaluation on fMRI, showing the effectiveness in correlation against response fo brain voxels, and its qualitative summarization with LLMs."

I think the authors adopted this term for just an analogy, but I would expect some quantitative comparison between the existing analysis of \"induction heads\" and the result of this study.\n\nMore ablation study, especially investigating with one omission of the component is recommended. I got this curiosity because it looks the fuzzy model is generally better than the exact model except its compute efficiency.\n\nIt looks the fMRI experiment is interesting, but jsut superfluous and should be investigated in the another study. In contrast, there are few discussion about the behavior of the method itself in-depth in the paper. Because the paper targeted on the interpretability of the method, the authors should focus on reinforcing such information instead of spreading the interest of the paper."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The limitations in comparison with other models: The paper only compares the Induction-Gram model with a few baseline models, making it difficult to comprehensively assess its relative strengths and weaknesses in the broader modeling field. The lack of comparisons with more diverse types of models, particularly those with unique advantages in interpretability and efficiency, fails to clearly demonstrate the model's true competitiveness in different modeling environments and hinders the identification of its optimal applicability across various scenarios. Insufficient explanation of experimental parameter settings: For some key experimental parameters, such as the hyperparameters in the Fuzzy Matching Model, the paper does not provide sufficient detail regarding their selection criteria and analysis of their impact on model performance. This makes it challenging for other researchers to understand the rationale behind these parameter settings, hindering their ability to effectively adjust and optimize parameters according to their research needs, which ultimately affects the model's reproducibility and scalability."

Can they elaborate on the specific mechanisms of this combination and the expected outcomes? \n2.Details of comparison with other models: The paper only compares the Induction-Gram model with a limited number of baseline models. To provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, it would be helpful to understand its specific advantages and disadvantages compared to other models that excel in interpretability and efficiency. Particularly, how does the Induction-Gram model's performance differ from these models when handling complex linguistic structures, domain-specific texts, and large-scale data?\n3.Impact of training data on the Fuzzy Matching Model: The paper states that the Fuzzy Matching Model was trained using the OpenWebText and Pile-train datasets but does not elaborate on how the selection of these datasets specifically impacts model performance. Different datasets may exhibit varying language styles, topic distributions, and data quality, which could affect the similarity metrics learned by the Fuzzy Matching Model. How do these factors influence the performance of the Induction-Gram model across different tasks?"

(2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=u2vAyMeLMm#discussion) for n-gram language modeling is combined with an handcrafted induction mechanism inspired by the induction heads observed to emerge in large language models during early training stages. The proposed approach is shown to improve next word prediction performance for shorter n-gram sequences where the Infini-gram approach underperforms by using local context. Moreover, authors experiment with using their proposed fuzzy induction approach as a draft model for speculative decoding, accelerating LLM generation in a similar or better way than current approaches. Finally, the proposed induction methodology is adapted to predict brain responses to natural language stimuli recorded via fMRI. Again, the induction method outperforms simpler matching baselines, obtaining performances short of state-of-the-art black-box LLM embeddings. Finally, authors employ LLMs to identify common properties of texts for which various prediction strategies perform well, finding induction matching to perform well on narratively critical phrases relying on preceding context."

The proposed combination of fuzzy induction matching and Infini-gram is simple yet elegant and seems to address the shortcomings of n-gram-based approaches in an effective way. The fMRI analysis provides an interesting perspective on extending such a technique to other sequence prediction tasks, showcasing promising results.

In light of this, the choice of the $\\tau = 8$ or $9$ in Equation 5 seems to suggest that most cases will recur to fuzzy matching. In light of this, is it even meaningful to maintain the n-gram component in Induction-gram, or are trends shown in these Figure not representative of other tested datasets?"
