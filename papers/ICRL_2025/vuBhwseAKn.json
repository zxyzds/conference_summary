    "title": "Deep-ComAIR: A Framework for Predicting TCR-pMHC Binding through Complex Structural Analysis",
    "abstract": "The binding process between T cell receptor (TCR) and the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is a fundamental mechanism in adaptive immunity. Current research on binding prediction primarily emphasizes the sequence and structural features of critical regions within these molecules, often neglecting the intricate structural changes that occur at the binding process, which can lead to biased representations. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, titled \u201cDeep-ComAIR,\u201d which effectively models the binding process by focusing on the complex structure of TCR-pMHC rather than individual components. This model enhances prediction accuracy by integrating features from three modalities: sequence, structural, and gene. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results evidenced by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.983 in binding reactivity prediction and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.833 in binding affinity prediction. These results highlight the framework's potential to deepen our understanding of TCR-pMHC interactions at the structural level and facilitate advancements in immunotherapy and vaccine design.",

                "value": "- The proposed model is largely an incremental work on DeepAIR model. This model mainly differs in terms of how the structure is encoded. It would be interesting to see how much difference using the structural embeddings of the complex instead of individual structures makes in the model performance. A direct comparison with the DeepAIR model for some examples of TCR/pMHCs pairs can be done to bring home the point about the importance of using the complex-structures. The same architecture (multimodal fusion + gated-attention), but with structural embeddings of individual monomers (instead of the complex) can also be used for comparison.\n\n- The current model is a black-box model which doesn't highlight which part of the sequence/structure are important for the binding. The attention weights can be used to highlight the residues that are important for the binding.\n\n- The structure of the TCR might not always be available. Foldseek relies on AlphaFold 2 structures for the structural embeddings, but they aren't always accurate. The dependence of the model performance on the structural model quality should be investigated. pLDDT scores from AlphaFold models can be used to this analysis. If there are experimental structures available in the PDB, using those structures instead of the predicted model might be more accurate.\n\n- Recent studies on TCR-pMHC prediction models suggest that these models aren't generalizable and have a strong data dependency. Therefore a more comprehensive benchamrking is needed to ascertain the performance of the models. This includes testing on multiple datasets and also looking at the peptide distributions of the training/testing sets. The authors have used the 10x Genomics website-data and VDJdb-database in this study. More testing can be done on datasets from McPAS-TCR, ImmuneCODE, and IEDB"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- It's not clear from the paper that how are the sequence embeddings derived from ESM2. I would assume that authors derived a fixed length embedding of 1280 dimensions per TCR-sequence (averaged over all residues). How were the TCR-sequence embeddings combined with the pMHC-sequence embeddings? Are the embeddings for TCR-sequence and pMHC-sequence derived separately and then combined?\n\n- The information about how training and testing sets were split is missing. In the 'DATASET AND NEGATIVE SAMPLES CONSTRUCTION' section, there needs to be information about the training and testing datasets. For sequence-based tasks, it's also important to look at the homology of the sequences and there isn't a large overlap between the training and testing dataset. The authors can look at tools like CD-HIT to ensure that the sequences in the testing and training-datasets are non-homologous (70 to 80% homology cut-off)\n\n- An additional suggestion to the authors would be to try some additional pre-trained models for encoding the strcuture/sequence. There are newer models such as ESM3, ProstT5, both of which now encode structure and sequence."

The authors didn't introduce how to generate the complex structures (I'm assuming that they followed DeepAIR to generate structures through AF2), then what's the difference between DeepAIR.\n2. The comparison method DeepAIR also utilizes the same three modalities as mentioned in the paper. Was a comparison conducted under the same context as DeepAIR? \n3. In Method section 3.3, the description of the Element-wise Attention module is vague, reducing it to basic matrix multiplication without clarifying whether it involves more complexity or specific design choices. Is the element-wise attention module just a matrix multiplication, or are there other details that haven't been explained?\n4. The model design for the baseline that ablates multimodal information is not detailed enough. How is the model for DeepAIR-seq, which utilizes only sequence-based features, designed?\n5. The paper only presents results on the test sets without showing training results or using 5-fold cross-validation.\n6. The authors do not provide code for reproduction.\n7.

However, these data do not appear to include structure data. No details are provided on how the structure data for training the model is obtained. Since this paper attributes most of the performance to structure data (moreover full complex structure data), this is a significant oversight. Similarly, the model is trained to predict binding affinity labels, but it is not clear how these binding affinity data are obtained, or how confidence scores are given for structural complexes. It is unclear whether the test set is a high-confidence or low-confidence dataset.\n\nSome details are lacking to reproduce the model, such as how \"sequences of varying lengths\" are generated. It is not clear whether $L_\\text{reactivity}$ and $L_\\text{affinity}$ are combined to train the model, or whether there are two different models.\n\nThe experiments to assess performance of Deep-ComAIR are limited. One of the major challenges in TCR-pMHC binding prediction is generalisation to pMHCs with little or no binding data, but the model is only assessed on a handful of peptides for which there is a wealth of data. Further ablation studies to the model would also be useful, to demonstrate the effect of using pretrained sequence representations and V/J gene labels.
