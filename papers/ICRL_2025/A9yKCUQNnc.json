    "title": "Understanding the Connection between Low-Dimensional Representation and Generalization via Interpolation",
    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the close connection between neural networks' generalization performance and their ability to learn low-dimensional representations of data. However, the theoretical foundation linking low-dimensional representations to generalization remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze this relationship from the perspective of interpolation and convex combinations. We argue that lower-dimensional representations increase the likelihood of new samples being expressed as convex combinations of the training set, thereby enhancing interpolation probability. We derive a generalization error upper bound under the interpolation regime, which becomes tighter as the dimensionality of the representation decreases. Furthermore, we investigate how the structure of the manifold affects interpolation probability by examining the volume of the convex hull formed by the manifold. Our theoretical and experimental results show that larger convex hull volumes are associated with higher interpolation probabilities. Additionally, we explore the impact of training data volume on interpolation, finding a significant power-law relationship between increased data volume, convex hull volume and interpolation probability. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of low-dimensional representations in improving the generalization performance of neural networks, supported by both theoretical insights and experimental evidence.",

                "value": "This paper aims to understand the connection between generalization and low-dimensional representations. Specifically, it examines the convex hull of the network's features/outputs for the training data and is interested in the probability (interpolation probability) that a new data point lies in it. The paper experimentally shows that one measure of effective dimension decreases, while the interpolation probability increases during training. \n\n**Reason for Score**\n\nOverall the idea is ineresting but the paper does not do enough. I do not think the new theory results provide new information. Some of the experiments are interesting, but a lot of the take aways do not seem novel. \n\nI think more thourough investigation into the concentration of outputs from neural networks (i.e. like nueral collapse, where the volume doesnt increase, but the interpolation probability does) could be interesting. Then connecting this to effective dimensionality could also be novel. However this would require many more experiments."

                "value": "The paper, I think, has a few issues. \n\n1. The Lipschitzness of the loss function is too strong of an assumption and hides a lot of complexities. For example, let $f_\\theta$ be my interpolating neural network. Let $x,y$ be any point in the training and $x',y'$ be any close points not in the training set. The Lipschitzness implies that the $x',y'$ loss is close to the loss for $x,y$ (which is 0), **regardless** of what $f(x')$ is, specifically, I can arbitrarily increase $\\|f(x') -y'\\|$ without changing the upper bound on the loss. Hence, this assumption is too strong, and the theorem does not say anything.\n\n2. Similarly, proposition 2 doesn't say anything either. Like clearly, if the measure of a set increases, then the probability of being in the set should go up. Of course, they can be large measure low probability sets, but the result doesn't say anything about this. \n\n3. Similarly, I am not sure what new insight is gained in Section 8. Yes, if we have more points then the convex has larger volume."

This paper confirms this from the perspective of the convex hull of training points, which may be novel itself, but there is only one theoretical claim (Theorem 5.1). Even for this claim, the proof is relatively straightforward: an adaptation of McDiarmid's inequality. Proposition 1 is even more trivial. I acknowledge the results (both theoretical and empirical ones) but don't think they clear the bar of ICLR. \n\n2.

The authors support their framework with theoretical proofs and experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating that neural networks tend to learn lower-dimensional manifolds during training, which is associated with improved generalization.

The architectural details of the \"5-layer MLP\" in Section 4 of the main text are not provided, and there are no supplementary materials $-$ there is no code to reproduce the empirical results in the paper. Moreover, the experiments in the main text are confined to MNIST with a simple fully connected network, which exhibit the expected training dynamics of decreasing intrinsic dimension and increasing interpolation probability over time. However, as shown in the appendix, some complex architectures like AlexNet on CIFAR-10 do not follow this pattern, with the intrinsic dimension increasing after an initial decrease (whereas other architectures like VGG-16 do follow this pattern). This discrepancy raises concerns about the scalability of the proposed theoretical framework to higher-dimensional data and more sophisticated models. Additionally, the focus on interpolation may be overly constrained, as real-world applications often require models to generalize beyond the convex hull of training data, a scenario not adequately addressed by the theory (as the authors themselves have acknowledged). This oversight may limit the framework's relevance in practical settings where extrapolation is necessary for robust generalization."

Also, there is no comparison with existing generalization bounds. It reads like the paper have proposed a new way of improving existing generalization bounds, but it is not. As their generalization bound is a naive concentration inequality, compared to state-of-the-art bounds I believe it would be weak, and would be hard to grasp the true phenomenon behind generalizatation.\n\n3. Also, it is hard to see the detailed picture that the paper is trying to depict. What I can see is that this paper tries to connect d, the dimension of the representation, and the set of the representations in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to show that generalization and low-dimensionness is connected because it leads to \"interpolating\" rather than \"extrapolating\". Is the paper showing things that support the claim? I am not convinced. What they do is\n\n- show that intrinsic dimension, interpolation probability, and convex hull volume changes over training.\n- show that the dimension of the representation is related to generalization (here, it is not the intrinsic dimension but the dimension of the embedding)\n- Larger dimension leads to smaller interpolation probability because it is harder to cover up the whole space when the dimension is large.\n- Larger volume of the convex hull of sampled data leads to higher interpolation probability (which is quite straightforward from the definition of interpolation probability)\n\nTwo things I couldn't understand were:\n-> Are generalization bounds and data volume directly related? for example, suppose data 1 has d = 1, volume = 100 and data 2 has d = 10, volume = 1000.  Surely data 2 will have larger interpolation probability. But the bound will be tighter when d=1.\n-> Why are interpolation probabilities important? More specifically, where did you use the assumption of interpolation in Theorem 5.1?\n\n4. Most of the claims in this paper are very straightforward or from different papers in the literature. The only new theorems are Thm 5.1 and Proposition 1, which are simply applying concentration inequalities or intergral inequalities. Hence this paper lacks theoretical novelty.\n\n5. Why is letting $L = O(\\sqrt{d})$ justifiable in Theorem 5.1? Actually $L = O(1/\\sqrt{d})$, provided that the loss function is bounded in a fixed interval. That is because $L||x-y|| \\approx ||f(x) - f(y)|| = O(1)$ and $||x|| = O(\\sqrt{d})$.  With this scaling, $d$ does not depend on the generalization bound.\n\n6. Some formatting errors: Proposition is labelled as 1, 2, ... whereas theorems are labelled as Thm 6.1, 6.2, .... In pg 7, you compare the interpolation probabilities for the triangle and circle twice."
