    "abstract": "We present a novel method to identify parameter of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using time series data. Our approach fits parameters by matching a collocation-based estimate of the integral of the learned derivative to an interpolation of the trajectory, thus avoiding the computational cost of ODE solvers in adjoint methods and the sensitivity to noise of derivative estimates in gradient matching methods. By employing batching strategies based on time subintervals and state components, our method achieves linear complexity in relation to system dimensions and dataset sizes. The method is highly parallel enabling fast gradient evaluations and a faster convergence than adjoint methods. For fully observed systems, we demonstrate the method on canonical dynamical systems, where the method achieves speed-ups of three orders of magnitude over adjoint methods and an increased robustness against observational noise. We provide an extension to partially observed systems and demonstrate the method on the Lorenz63 attractor.",

At the beginning of Section 3, the loss function \ud835\udc59 is introduced, but this notation does not appear in Section 3.1. I assume it corresponds to the function in Equation (7)?\n\n2. The matrices \ud835\udc37 and \ud835\udc49 in Section 3.1 are undefined. After Equation (4), it\u2019s mentioned that the transformations are detailed in the appendix, yet the definition of \\tilde{D} is still unclear.\n\n3. The start of Section 3.2 states that (7) is solved using Algorithm 1. However, Algorithm 1 is written ambiguously, making it difficult to understand how it applies to solving (7). A more detailed, step-by-step description would be very helpful. For instance:\n\na. How is \u0398 initialized?\nb. What exactly does Step 2, \u201cbuild denoised set,\u201d entail?\nc. What is X_s in Step 6?\n\n3.1 Additionally, it is unclear how Algorithm 1 is inspired by the ADMM algorithm (as claimed in Section 3.2); there appear to be no apparent connections between them.\n\n4. The theoretical bound in Section 3.3 is not presented as a theorem. Without a precise statement of assumptions and conclusions, the main result of this paper is difficult to interpret. For example, the assumption in Section 3.3.1, \u201cSupposing the gradient descent converges to an optimum \u0398\u2217 such that L_2(\u0398\u2217)=0\u201d is unclear and appears overly restrictive in requiring convergence."

                "value": "1.\tA major concern arises from the separation of the dynamics into independent subintervals, which results in the loss of continuity between them after ignoring eq (2b). This separation could cause significant issues in the overall performance of the model since the connection between the subintervals is crucial. It is essential to conduct experiments to assess how well the model learns the relationships between these subintervals.\n2.\tThe method could be improved by incorporating eq. (2b) in eqs (6) and (7), similar to how eq (2c) is treated. While this may not be computationally efficient, it is necessary to explore this modification experimentally to examine its impact on performance.\n3.\tThe claim that eq (6) uses an Augmented Lagrangian is incorrect, as the method used is actually a penalty method. The Augmented Lagrangian requires solving a saddle system, but it generally provides better convergence to the minimizer of constrained problems compared to the penalty method. While the penalty method is conceptually simpler, it requires the penalty parameter $\\rho$ to approach infinity for the constraints to be satisfied mathematically. Therefore, the choice of $\\rho$ in the penalty method chosen by the authors is critical to ensuring constraint satisfaction. This parameter $\\rho$ is a new hyperparameter not present in traditional NODEs, and a study of its effects is needed.\n4.\tThe performance of the proposed method is highly dependent on the polynomial interpolation degree $K$. I recommend an ablation study to investigate the effects of varying $K$ to better understand its influence on model performance. In addition, comparisons with other node types beyond the LGR node leveraged in this study is also required."
