    "abstract": "Existing neural multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) methods still exhibit an optimality gap since they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic features of problem instances. A significant factor contributing to this shortfall is their reliance solely on graph-modal information. To overcome this, we propose a novel graph-image multimodal fusion (GIMF) framework that enhances neural MOCO methods by integrating graph and image information of the problem instances. Our GIMF framework comprises three key components: (1) a constructed coordinate image to better represent the spatial structure of the problem instance, (2) a problem-size adaptive resolution strategy during the image construction process to improve the cross-size generalization of the model, and (3) a multimodal fusion mechanism with modality-specific bottlenecks to efficiently couple graph and image information. We demonstrate the versatility of our GIMF by implementing it with two state-of-the-art neural MOCO backbones. Experimental results on classic MOCO problems show that our GIMF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural MOCO methods and exhibits superior generalization capability.",

As far as I know, many Euclidean TSP models, like [1, 2], use positions directly as input, which requires less space and provides more precise information.\n\n2. Compared to typical neural MOCO methods, GIMF uses sparse matrix images as input, resulting in larger neural network sizes and an inability to handle larger-scale routing problems."

The GIMF framework integrates graph and image information of problem instances, which is designed to overcome the limitations of existing neural MOCO methods that rely solely on graph-modal information. The main contribution of the proposed method is the coordinate image construction, which provides complementary information to the graph representation.To improve the model's generalization across different problem sizes, a Problem-size Adaptive Resolution (PSAR) strategy is proposed during the image construction process, which helps maintain a stable density for both the image and patches. A multimodal fusion mechanism with Modality-Specific Bottlenecks (MSB) is designed to efficiently couple graph and image information. \n\nThe GIMF framework is implemented with two state-of-the-art neural MOCO backbones, namely CNH and PMOCO.

The construction of coordinate images and the use of PSAR strategy are innovative steps that address the limitations of relying solely on graph information. The proposed MSB in multimodal fusion mechanism is also a novel contribution.\n\n2. The paper is well-organized and written in a clear and concise manner. The introduction effectively sets the stage by outlining the challenges in MOCO and the motivation behind the GIMF framework. The preliminary section clearly describes the definition of the MOCO problem and related concepts, as well as the graph transformer for MOCO. The methodology section is detailed, providing a clear explanation of the image construction process, the PSAR strategy, and the multimodal fusion mechanism.\n\n3. The significance mainly comes from its novelty.Specifically, leveraging a multimodal approach that incorporates image-modal information, which has the potential to improve many existing neural MOCO methods. The paper is also likely to inspire further research in constructing and learning from images of MOCO problems.\n\n4. The experimental results suggest that GIMF does not obviously increase computational time of the neural MOCO basebone. The major innovations PSAR and MSB are validated by ablation study."
