    "abstract": "Geometric tempering is a popular approach to sampling from challenging multi-modal probability distributions by instead sampling from a sequence of distributions which interpolate, using the geometric mean, between an easier proposal distribution and the target distribution. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the soundness of this approach when the sampling algorithm is Langevin dynamics, proving both upper and lower bounds. Our upper bounds are the first analysis in the literature under functional inequalities. They assert the convergence of tempered Langevin in continuous and discrete-time, and their minimization leads to closed-form optimal tempering schedules for some pairs of proposal and target distributions. Our lower bounds demonstrate a simple case where the geometric tempering takes exponential time, and further reveal that the geometric tempering can suffer from poor functional inequalities and slow convergence, even when the target distribution is well-conditioned. Overall, our results indicate that the geometric tempering may not help, and can even be harmful for convergence.",

                "value": "This work studies the convergence guarantee of geometric tempering for the Langevin diffusion and its time-discretization the Langevin algorithm. The authors prove a convergence rate under a general tempering schedule, demonstrating dependency on the isoperimetry of the intermediate probability measures, in particular their log-Sobolev constant. While this constant can be suitably controlled when both measures are strongly log-concave, the authors show that even when both proposal and target densities are unimodal, intermediate measures can suffer from a poor log-Sobolev constant that scales exponentially with the distance between the modes of proposal and target measures."

For example, breaking into multiple paragraphs and adding paragraph titles could help with readability and following the discussion.\n* The lower bound examples hold in dimension 1, and show exponentially bad dependence on the distance between modes. While these bounds are interesting, it is not very intuitive to me why it would be natural for the distance between modes to grow in fixed dimensions. On the other hand, in a high-dimensional setting, it is more intuitive that $m$ grows with square root of dimension. Could it be straightforward to (perhaps only intuitively) extend the lower bounds to high-dimensional settings?"

The authors demonstrate that geometric tempering can actually worsen functional inequalities exponentially, even when both the proposal and target distributions have favorable properties. Through theoretical analysis, they show a simple bimodal case where geometric tempering takes exponential time to converge. More strikingly, they prove that similar poor convergence results can occur even with unimodal target distributions that have good functional inequalities. These results suggest that geometric tempering may not only fail to help with convergence but could actually be harmful in some cases, challenging the conventional wisdom about its utility."
