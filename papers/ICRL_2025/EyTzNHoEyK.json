    "title": "DrivAerML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Road-Car External Aerodynamics",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.",

Firstly, it provides one of the first large-scale, high-fidelity CFD datasets for complex automotive aerodynamics geometries, addressing a significant gap in the availability of open-source training data for ML models in this field. The use of 500 parametrically morphed variants of the DrivAer notchback generic vehicle represents a creative combination of existing ideas, expanding the dataset's applicability beyond a single geometry. This approach not only enhances the diversity of the dataset but also simulates real-world automotive design variations, which is a novel contribution to the field.\nThe quality of the dataset itself is exceptional, as it is generated using consistent and validated automatic workflows that are representative of industrial state-of-the-art practices. The use of hybrid RANS-LES methods for CFD simulations ensures that the data is of the highest fidelity, which is crucial for the development and testing of accurate ML models. The dataset's comprehensive nature, including full flow-field data, surface data, and application-relevant quantities, further enhances its quality and utility for researchers and practitioners.\nThe paper is well-structured and clearly articulated. The authors effectively communicate the motivation behind the dataset, its construction, and its potential applications. The clarity of the paper is further enhanced by the detailed descriptions of the CFD methods, the workflow for dataset generation, and the validation against experimental data. The inclusion of visual aids, such as figures and tables, aids in understanding the complexity and diversity of the dataset. Additionally, the paper clearly outlines the structure and contents of the dataset, making it accessible for potential users.\nThe significance of this paper lies in its potential to revolutionize automotive aerodynamics by enabling faster and more cost-effective fluid flow predictions during the design process. By providing a high-fidelity dataset, the authors empower the research community to develop and test ML models that can significantly accelerate design optimization studies. The dataset's open-source nature and permissive licensing (CC-BY-SA) ensure widespread accessibility and encourage collaborative innovation across academia and industry. The paper's contribution to removing limitations from prior results, such as the lack of high-quality, public-domain CFD data, is significant and has the potential to inspire new research directions and applications in automotive aerodynamics and beyond."

                "value": "While the paper provides a comparison of the CFD methodology against experimental data for the baseline geometry, it could benefit from a more extensive validation across a broader range of geometries within the dataset. Actionable Insight: The authors could consider validating the CFD results against experimental data for a subset of the 500 parametrically varied geometries to ensure the dataset's accuracy across different configurations.\nThe paper mentions the use of statistical quality control in the automated workflows but does not delve into the specifics of data preprocessing steps. Actionable Insight: Providing a detailed account of data preprocessing, including any normalization or filtering applied to the CFD outputs, would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the dataset.\nThe dataset focuses on force and moment coefficients, which are crucial, but other aerodynamics metrics such as drag polars or pressure distribution details could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the flow field. Actionable Insight: Expanding the dataset to include a wider array of aerodynamics metrics could increase its utility for researchers interested in specific aspects of vehicle aerodynamics.\nThe paper conducts a preliminary ML evaluation using a GNN approach but does not explore the performance of other ML models or deeper analysis of model limitations on the dataset. Actionable Insight: The authors could experiment with a variety of ML models and hyperparameter tuning to provide a more thorough evaluation of the dataset's predictive capabilities and to identify any patterns or biases in the data that could affect ML model performance.\nGiven the rapid advancements in CFD and ML, the dataset might become outdated. Actionable Insight: The authors should consider establishing a protocol for regular updates to the dataset, incorporating new geometries, boundary conditions, and possibly even results from more advanced CFD simulations as they become feasible.\nThe paper does not discuss plans for community engagement or feedback mechanisms to improve the dataset post-release. Actionable Insight: Establishing a forum or platform for users to provide feedback, suggest improvements, or contribute additional data could foster a collaborative environment around the dataset and enhance its long-term value.\nAlthough the dataset is synthetic, it is derived from real-world automotive design principles. Actionable Insight: The authors might consider an ethical review process to address any potential concerns, even if they are perceived as minor, to set a precedent for responsible data handling in the field."

This includes the choice of geometry that is partly based on \"expectations of industrial feasibility\" and parameter ranges \"based on engineering judgement\". More information or a brief discussion is should be added, e.g. to add more concrete criteria for what constitutes \"industrial feasibility\" or to explain the specific engineering principles that informed their judgment on parameter ranges.\n\n- The missing reference numbers to the corresponding sections in e.g. chapter \"Objectives and Main Contributions\" and \"CFD Methods\", as well as the reference to the general appendix (named \"SI\") instead of explicit chapters throughout the paper impede the understanding of the presented information. \n\n- The low-fidelity dataset \"DrivAerNet\" is mentioned. Since the datasets aim at similar uasage a more thorough discussion should be provided. In best case a validation that the new dataset can improve data based models. Moreover, a discussion on further related data sets would help to point out the specific benefits of the proposed data set.\n\n- The paper is not self-contained. The appendix contains information that is in fact necessary to undestand the data set and possible usage scenarios. This includes the validation of the method that references the underlying experiment cases and parts of the comparison. This is also the case for the sampling of the parameter space (in the next bullet point). This information is required to understand the data set and potential usage scenarios should thus be included in the paper.  \n\n- Even with information from the appendix crucial information for a data set remains unclear. E.g. What is the number of sampled points for each parameter and thus how dense are the parameters sampled? The appendix shows a distribution for two parameters with maybe something between 100 and 200 data points (exakt number not given). Thus there a still 14 dimensions unsampeled, but only 400-500 points left. This seems like a very sparse data set. MeshGraphNets, which promise generalizybility w.r.t geometry, are mentioned. However, sampling seems (from the above estimation) too sparse to achieve this generalization. This should be discussed. Also further potential applications should be discussed w.r.t the size of the data set. Accordingly, the \"ML Evaluation\" section should be detailed, e.g by\n- a complete breakdown of the number of samples for each parameter.\n- a discussion on how the sparsity of the dataset might affect its utility for different machine learning tasks, particularly in relation to geometric generalization\n- more details on the ML evaluation, including the specific architecture used, loss function formulation, and a more critical analysis of the results in light of the dataset's characteristics.\n- the authors thoughts on potential future work to address the dataset's limitations, such as conducting a sensitivity analysis to inform more targeted sampling."

Consider specifying which metrics were used, how the dataset was split for training/validation/testing, and any comparisons made with baseline methods. This would help highlight how the dataset enables meaningful performance comparisons across models.\n\n3. When defining a \"good\" public dataset? It would be useful to discuss qualities beyond size alone. For instance, diversity in scenes, real-world relevance, and usability in various model architectures are important factors. Additionally, describing any distribution plans and dataset accessibility options would be valuable in demonstrating the impact and reach of the dataset. This could also increase community engagement and foster broader adoption.\n\n4. What are the dataset requirements for NNs?
