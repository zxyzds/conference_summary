    "title": "Towards Secure Tuning: Mitigating Security Risks Arising from Benign Instruction Fine-Tuning",
    "abstract": "Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has become an essential method for adapting base Large Language Models (LLMs) into variants for professional and private use. However, researchers have raised concerns over a significant decrease in LLMs' security following IFT, even when the IFT process involves entirely benign instructions (termed Benign IFT). Our study represents a pioneering effort to mitigate the security risks arising from Benign IFT. Specifically, we conduct a Module Robustness Analysis, aiming to investigate how LLMs' internal modules contribute to their security. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel IFT strategy, called the Modular Layer-wise Learning Rate (ML-LR) strategy. In our analysis, we implement a simple security feature classifier that serves as a proxy to measure the robustness of modules (e.g. $Q$/$K$/$V$, etc.). Our findings reveal that the module robustness shows clear patterns, varying regularly with the module type and the layer depth. Leveraging these insights, we develop a proxy-guided search algorithm to identify a robust subset of modules, termed $Mods_{Robust}$. During IFT, the ML-LR strategy employs differentiated learning rates for $Mods_{Robust}$ and the rest modules. Our experimental results show that in security assessments, the application of our ML-LR strategy significantly mitigates the rise in harmfulness of LLMs following Benign IFT. Notably, our ML-LR strategy has little impact on the usability or expertise of LLMs following Benign IFT. Furthermore, we have conducted comprehensive analyses to verify the soundness and flexibility of our ML-LR strategy.",

                "value": "The authors propose fine-tuning certain components of an LLM with a lower learning rate to increase model robustness to adversarial attacks. They focus on the setting of benign instruction tuning, where the instructions themselves are not harmless.\n\nThey motivate this approach through a preliminary analysis of the effects on model safety of perturbing different model components (e.g. Q/K/V matrices) at different layers. They do this by training a harmful prompt classifier on the final embeddings of the LLM, and analyzing the drop in accuracy of this classifier when a given component is perturbed (although, as far as I can tell, they do not say how exactly they perturb the components). \n\nThe authors find that (1) components in earlier layers are more sensitive (in the sense described above) than ones in later layers, (2) Q and K matrices are more sensitive than other kinds of components, and (3) combinations of robust (i.e. non-sensitive) components can be sensitive (i.e. perturbing all components at the same time has a big impact in the classifier\u2019s accuracy). \n\nBased on these three findings, they propose a heuristic search routine for identifying sensitive modules inside the LLM. They then propose decreasing the learning rate of these modules by a large factor (on the order of $10^{-4}$) relative to the remaining components during fine-tuning, in effort to increase robustness to adversarial attacks. This method is referred to as Modular Layer-wise Learning Rate (ML-LR).\n\nThey then evaluate this method\u2019s effect on general model capabilities, domain-specific capabilities, and adversarial robustness. They work with Llama 2, Llama 3 and Vicuna models, and use LoRA fine-tuning. They find that regular instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and ML-LR on general domain data produce similar results on capabilities evaluations, but ML-LR leads to lower attack success rates on many adversarial attack benchmarks. They conduct a similar study when fine-tuning on a mathematics task, and also find that the resulting capabilities are similar, but the susceptibility to attacks is lower (roughly half the attack success rate), for ML-LR compared to IFT."

                "value": "1. Module robustness analysis uses questionable scientific methodology: the authors pre-train a harmfulness classifier on the final embeddings of the LLM, and proceed to claim that, if a perturbation on a model component decreases the accuracy of this *same* pre-trained classifier, then this corresponds to the model safety being sensitive to this module. However, perturbing one model component can simply produce a distribution shift in the final embeddings, and need not influence top-level model behavior. \n\n1. In fact, the three \u201cpatterns\u201d identified by the authors on their perturbation studies could just as well be explained through the lens of distribution shift:\n\n    - Pattern A: perturbations in earlier layers can get amplified throughout the forward pass, causing a larger distribution shift, and causing classifier accuracy to drop more. This is similar to how, in a physical system, perturbing the initial conditions can lead to larger discrepancies in the final state, as the perturbation can get amplified by system dynamics through time.\n\n    - Pattern B: perturbations in Q and K modules impact the attention coefficients, and in particular are passed through a softmax function (as the coefficients are given by $a_{ij} = softmax(x_i^T W_Q^T W_K x_j / \\sqrt{d})$), which can significantly alter the attention patterns of the model, leading to greater distribution shift.\n\n    - Pattern C: perturbing several model components and composing them can amplify each perturbation (e.g. multiplicatively), leading to greater distribution shift.\n\n1. Hence, I am not convinced by the author\u2019s claim that their robustness analysis says anything about the \u201csecurity\u201d of individual model components. Crucial to my perception is the fact that they don\u2019t retrain the harmfulness classifier after the perturbations, and simply use it as an absolute measure of model safety.\n\n1. As highlighted above, the authors (to the best of my understanding) do not explain how they perturb components of the model in section 3.2, rendering the section unreproducible, in addition to arguably fundamentally scientifically flawed as argued above. Since this section is a key part of the paper, I consider that this constitutes enough reason for this paper to be rejected.\n\n1. Presentation: \n\n    - the formatting of the tables in the paper does not conform to usual standards of conference publications, e.g. using vertical bars.\n\n    - In certain tables, e.g. Table 3, the names of models (e.g. Llama2-7B) are placed very strangely among the numerical results. In the case of Table 3, they are also incorrectly formatted (e.g. Llama213B rather than Llama2-7B or other reasonable formatting choices)."

The decrease in learning rate of \u201csensitive components\u201d is very significant, being as large as $10^{-4}$ in some cases. One important ablation for this method would be to set the learning rate of these modules to zero, since they are already much lower than the rest. Have the authors evaluated this alternative?"

Evaluations on a broader range of models with different architectures may need to be conducted.\n\n3. Fig. 6 shows that ML-LR is less effective than IFT against optimization-based attacks (e.g., GCG). Given that GCG is a state-of-the-art optimization-based attack, the paper should explain why this outcome occurs."

                "value": "1. My biggest concern is, the experimental results are not realistic. In Table 2, the quality of responses generated by BASE is even better than that of IFT and ML-LR. If that\u2019s the case, why do we use fine-tuning? The model obtained through fine-tuning not only has reduced usability but also decreased robustness. This might imply that the quality of the fine-tuning training data is poor. The paper should at least ensure that higher quality recovery can be achieved after IFT or ML-LR.\n\n2. The evaluation is somewhat lacking. For the general-domain scenario, the paper only tested the LLaMA series models, and for the specific-domain scenario, it only added the Vicuna series models, which are also based on LLaMA. Since the paper achieves fine-tuning by adjusting the learning rate of different parameters in the model, it should test a wider variety of LLM architectures, such as Mistral and Gemma.\n\n3. The experimental results are also not very promising. Specifically, in Fig. 6, when the training loss of the two methods is similar, ML-LR is sometimes less effective against GCG (the state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack) compared to IFT."

Sometimes the LLM can discern benign/malicious prompts, but fails to correctly react to it (e.g., refuse or not refuse)[1] (discussion on hypothesis 1 in the [1]). From this viewpoint, just discerning benign/malicious prompts without considering model's response may lead to insufficient performance when finding $Mods_{Robust}$. But it's fine to leave for future research.\n2. The authors use AdvBench to train proxy, and also use it (though they may not overlap) as one of benchmarks when evaluate the IFT performance. It is better to do security evaluation on other safety-related datasets with different distributions.\n3. Some figures and tables can be further polished. For example, I think the resolution of Figure 5 is a low with some words (e.g, #1->#7) seeming a little blurred; Figure. 3(b)'s layout can be further adjusted to match 3(a); And some highlights (bold or other markers) can be added on some table results (For example, Table 2.

I notice in *Line 180*, you mention you make analaysis on 4 LLMs, and in the experiment, you use 5 LLMs (with a new Llama3.1-8b). Why analysis on Llama3.1-8b is skipped?\n3.
