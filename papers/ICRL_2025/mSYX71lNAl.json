    "title": "Why pre-training is beneficial for downstream classification tasks?",
    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that pre-training brings benefits to downstream tasks by boosting accuracy and speeding up convergence, but the exact reasons for these two benefits still remain unclear.\nTo this end, we propose to quantitatively and accurately explain effects of pre-training on the downstream task from a novel game-theoretic view, which also sheds new light into the learning behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs).\nSpecifically, we extract and quantify the knowledge encoded by the pre-trained model, and further track the changes of such knowledge during the fine-tuning process.\nInterestingly, we discover that only a limited amount of pre-trained model's knowledge is preserved for the inference of downstream tasks, and such preserved knowledge is very difficult for a model training from scratch to learn.\nThus, with the help of this exclusively learned and useful knowledge, the fine-tuned model usually achieves better performance.\nBesides, we discover that pre-training can guide the fine-tuned model to learn target knowledge of the downstream task more directly and quickly than the model training from scratch, which accounts for the faster convergence of the fine-tuned model.\nThe code will be released when the paper is accepted.",

They connect recent progress in explaining DNN behavior through game-theoretic interactions to track changes in learned knowledge during the fine-tuning process. The authors propose methods to identify preserved, discarded, and newly acquired knowledge by tracking these changes. Equipped with these results, the paper concludes that, compared to training from scratch, pre-training allows the fine-tuned model to encode more exclusively-learned and discriminative knowledge for inference and to acquire target knowledge more quickly and directly. This accounts for the superior classification performance and faster convergence of the fine-tuned model."

                "value": "1. Despite ambitious claims in the title and abstract, the manuscript primarily applies existing techniques to transfer learning, leading only to widely recognized conclusions without offering new theoretical insights or surprising experimental results. The manuscript falls short of the ICLR acceptance standard.\n2. Given that fine-tuning commonly suffers from catastrophic forgetting and that improvements often stem from leveraging common pre-trained knowledge, the presented experimental results are predictable and lack significance.\n3. The empirical analysis uses a broad array of target pre-trained models, including VGG-16, ResNet-50, ViT-small, ViT-base, BERT-base, and DistillBERT. These models differ significantly in terms of parameters, architectures, and pre-training strategies, spanning CNNs and transformers with varying datasets. The conclusions drawn from these comparisons merely confirm that the proposed metrics show consistent trends across different models.\n4. Following previous point, the paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis, such as comparing supervised versus unsupervised pre-trained ResNet-50 models on ImageNet. It should investigate how variations in epochs and other hyperparameters might affect behavior, and whether the proposed metrics can detect these differences.\n5. The domain gap between the target domain and the pre-trained dataset is a critical factor in fine-tuning behavior, yet the choice of fine-tuning datasets in the study seems arbitrary. The paper should clarify how the proposed metrics handle behaviors influenced by transfer gaps.\n6. The experimental setup requires refinement; for example, previous research [1] indicates that linear probing is more challenging than full fine-tuning (requiring a much larger learning rate). The study treats these settings as equivalent. Note that different learning rates and training durations could alter conclusions regarding knowledge forgetting or not.\n7. The paper focuses on classification problems. But transfer learning applications extend beyond this scope. The relationship between pre-text tasks and downstream tasks is also a critical factor in fine-tuning behavior.  Can these metrics extend to border transfer scenarios?\n\n[1] He, Kaiming, et al. \"Momentum contrast for unsupervised visual representation learning.\" CVPR 2020."

                "value": "1. Lack of clear motivation: The paper lacks clear motivation for using a game-theoretic approach, as similar conclusions about pre-training benefits have been reached through alternative methods, such as feature space analysis (e.g., Deng et al., 2023). Additionally, it does not provide a discussion comparing the advantages or unique insights offered by the game-theoretic approach over existing methods, leaving its added value unclear.\n\n2. Lack of Practical Utility and Actionable Recommendations: Although the paper suggests the advantages of using pretrained models for downstream classification, it doesn\u2019t provide concrete recommendations for how practitioners could adjust pre-training or fine-tuning protocols based on this insight of preserved or newly added knowledge. For example, it remains unclear how to retain more useful information or optimize the number of fine-tuning epochs.\n\n3. Computational Complexity and Scalability Concerns: The paper does not address whether these metrics are feasible for large-scale models or datasets, raising concerns about scalability for real-world datasets.\n\n4. Neglect of Discarded Knowledge\u2019s Role in Robustness and Generalization: The paper assumes that discarded knowledge is irrelevant but does not analyze if this information affects model robustness, generalization to out-of-distribution data, or resilience to adversarial attacks. Understanding this could provide a more nuanced view of pre-training benefits and clarify whether certain discarded knowledge could enhance model robustness.\n\n5. Continual and Online Learning Analysis: The paper does not explore scenarios where data arrives incrementally, as in continual or online learning. Research such as [1] suggests that in these cases, training from scratch may outperform using a pre-trained model. Examining the impact of preserved and discarded knowledge in such settings would extend the paper\u2019s relevance.\n\n6.  Evaluation with self-supervised pretrained model: Self-supervised learning has shown strong generalizability for classification and could yield different knowledge preservation dynamics compared to supervised pre-training. Experiments comparing self-supervised and supervised pre-training could reveal how each approach affects preserved and discarded knowledge, especially for tasks with limited labeled data.\n\n7. Comparison of CNNs vs. Transformers :\nSince CNNs and transformers represent data differently, they may encode and preserve different types of knowledge. It will be interesting to explore further whether CNNs or transformers retain more useful knowledge for downstream tasks, which could inform architecture selection for different scenarios.\n\n8. The approach to annotating semantic parts for calculating interactions in this paper appears to be limited by arbitrary selection, as they randomly choose 2 images for each category to annotate semantic parts and compute interactions. While this strategy reduces computational complexity, it might introduce potential biases and undermines the rigor of interaction measurement by possibly excluding critical semantic parts. This might weaken the reliability of the results, as the randomly chosen annotations may not accurately represent the model's true interactions with significant features. Please elaborate on this.\n\nReferences: [1]  Ash, J. and Adams, R.P., 2020. On warm-starting neural network training. Advances in neural information processing systems, 33, pp.3884-3894."

While the authors thoroughly verify their hypotheses about pre-training benefits, they rely more on theoretical justification and prior work for the validity of their interaction analysis method itself.\n\nThe motivation for why this procedure should work is difficult to follow. Much of the text uses the justification of a proven sparsity property, but there isn't a clear intuition of why this property should hold for DNNs. Some of it is discussed in Appendix A and B, but would be helpful to have toy experiments to justify both this property but also the method itself recovers the correct ground truth of interactions in a controlled environment.\n\nThe method appears extremely similar to the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approach. Much of this is mentioned in the citations of the related work, but the main contribution of this work appears to be the application of the SHAP approach to study the influence of training on fine-tuning.\n\nMinor things:\n\nPlease specify the pre-training datasets for the language models.\n\nGrammar Issue, Line 100"
