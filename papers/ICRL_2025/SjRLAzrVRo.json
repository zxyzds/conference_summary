    "title": "Meta ControlNet: Enhancing Task Adaptation via Meta Learning",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image synthesis has attracted extensive attention recently. In particular, \nControlNet that uses image-based prompts exhibits powerful capability in image tasks such as canny edge detection and generates images well aligned with these prompts. However, vanilla ControlNet generally requires extensive training of around 5000 steps to achieve a desirable control for a single task. Recent context-learning approaches have improved its adaptability, but mainly for edge-based tasks, and rely on paired examples. Thus, two important open issues are yet to be addressed to reach the full potential of ControlNet: (i) zero-shot control for certain tasks and (ii) faster adaptation for non-edge-based tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel Meta ControlNet method, \nwhich adopts the task-agnostic meta learning technique and features a new layer freezing design. Meta ControlNet significantly reduces learning steps to attain control ability from 5000 to 1000. Further, Meta ControlNet exhibits direct zero-shot adaptability in edge-based tasks without any finetuning, and achieves control within only 100 finetuning steps in more complex non-edge tasks such as Human Pose.",

The paper only shows qualitative results, which makes it hard to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.\n2. Zero-shot capability. This paper claims that the proposed method can achieve zero-shot control in edge tasks. The model is trained on HED, Segmentation, and Depth map which belong to the edge tasks. It raises a question about whether the model has achieved zero-shot control in edge tasks. If we train ControlNet on three tasks, and then test the model on Canny and Normal, can ControlNet achieve similar 'zero-shot' control in these two tasks?\n3. Training costs. If there are greater costs in training and we still need to fine-tune the model on new tasks like pose even with fewer steps (the total costs mighit be increased), we need to elborate more on the training costs and its significance."

The insight of this paper is that, the initial encoder blocks are directly linked to the control images of each task. And the middle and latter encoder blocks capture common and high-level information thus can be retained and shared across tasks. So simply training the initial encoder blocks can largely reduce training overhead during Meta ControlNet\u2019s training phase."

Since we know that conditions with similar representation type (such as sketch and canny)  can directly adapt to each other without training.\n\n(3) Providing more results of how the proposed method perform compared to other meta learning methods would be helpful for paper quality."
