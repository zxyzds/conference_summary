    "title": "Arti-PG: A Procedural Toolbox to Synthesize Large-Scale and Diverse Articulated Objects with Rich Annotations",
    "abstract": "The acquisition of substantial volumes of 3D articulated object data is expensive and time-consuming, and consequently the scarcity of 3D articulated object data becomes an obstacle for deep learning methods to achieve remarkable performance in various articulated object understanding tasks. Meanwhile, pairing these object data with detailed annotations to enable training for various tasks is also difficult and labor-intensive to achieve. In order to expeditiously gather a significant number of 3D articulated objects with comprehensive and detailed annotations for training, we propose Articulated Object Procedural Generation toolbox, a.k.a. Arti-PG toolbox. Arti-PG toolbox consists of i) descriptions of articulated objects by means of a generalized structure program along with their analytic correspondence to the objects\u2019 point cloud, ii) procedural rules about manipulations on the structure program to synthesize large-scale and diverse new articulated objects, and iii) mathematical descriptions of knowledge (e.g. affordance, semantics, etc.) to provide annotations to the synthesized object. Arti-PG has two appealing properties for providing training data for articulated object understanding tasks: i) objects are created with unlimited variations in shape through program-oriented structure manipulation, ii) Arti-PG is widely applicable to diverse tasks by easily providing comprehensive and detailed annotations. Arti-PG now supports the procedural generation of 26 categories of articulate objects and provides annotations across a wide range of both vision and manipulation tasks, and we provide exhaustive experiments which fully demonstrate its advantages. We will make Arti-PG toolbox publicly available for the community to use. More details, analysis and discussions are provided in technical appendices.",

A structure program is used to specify the primitive geometry and connectivity for each part as a descriptor of the general structure of the input object. Then the geometric details is describe as the deformation from the primitives to the original surface by finding the point-correspondence.\n-\tOnce representing the object in the program, it takes two steps to synthesize a new 3D articulated object: use mathematical rules to randomize the structure first, and then recover the geometry with point-wise correspondence. Following the 3D synthesis, a series of mathematical rules is applied to annotate the object automatically. All these components are integrated into the proposed Articulated Object Procedural Generation toolbox (ArtiPG-toolbox)."

It is unclear what the main contributions are claimed and demonstrated in this work. Based on my understanding, the proposed system is helpful to automate the augmentation process of the existing datasets, but it is not really creating new objects at scale as it is essentially using the existing datasets as a library to composite more objects in a combinatorial way under certain assumptions and with lots of manually crafted rules.\n-\t**Experiment purpose is vague**. It is unclear what the experiment section is trying to validate. Why the three tasks are chosen to do the benchmark? Why only the PointWOLF is reported as the baseline? For the data itself, how is the realism of the synthesized objects evaluated and guaranteed?\n-\t**Insufficient discussion on the assumption and limitation**.

Would other related parts adapt accordingly?

With this hierarchical generation philosophy, Arti-PG proposes a two-stage generation pipeline, together with a labeling and annotation process. Arti-PG can successfully create large amounts of articulated objects with diverse shapes. Experiments demonstrate that models trained using these generated articulated objects can perform better than those trained with a small amount of data.
