    "title": "On Rollouts in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) seeks to enhance data efficiency by learning a model of the environment and generating synthetic rollouts from it. However, accumulated model errors during these rollouts can distort the data distribution, negatively impacting policy learning and hindering long-term planning. Thus, the accumulation of model errors is a key bottleneck in current MBRL methods. We propose Infoprop, a model-based rollout mechanism that separates aleatoric from epistemic model uncertainty and reduces the influence of the latter on the data distribution. Further, Infoprop keeps track of accumulated model errors along a model rollout and provides termination criteria to limit data corruption. We demonstrate the capabilities of Infoprop in the Infoprop-Dyna algorithm, reporting state-of-the-art performance in Dyna-style MBRL on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks while substantially increasing rollout length and data quality.",

                "value": "This paper proposes Infoprop, a rollout mechanism designed to improve sample efficiency and asymptotic performance in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). Infoprop addresses the issue of epistemic model uncertainty typically introduced by ensemble methods or dropouts. It projects sampled next states into the maximum likelihood distribution of the predicted next state distribution and uses an information-theoretic criterion to determine the termination point of rollouts. When applied to Dyna-style MBRL, Infoprop demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, as shown in experiment results."

The idea is presented carefully with a derivation for the main result.\n  \nSignificance & Related work\n=========\nThe paper has a brief related work section, as part of the main paper, which is appreciated. However, there is a need for a deeper analysis of existing work, including  more in-depth comparisons that show the benefit of Infoprop to others, specifically including work in using simulated rollouts to guarantee performance, robust MBRL (Sung 2024, Kuo 2021), risk sensitivity (e.g. Webster 2021) and other uses of information theory in MBRL.\n\nPresentation\n=========\nThe paper is well written with few typos, usually around empty spaces in the text.\n\nQuality\n======\nMy main concerns are around the quality of the experimentation (see below) and on the need for authors to explore the limitations of their approach a bit deeper before publication. For example, the authors mention that the rollouts exhibit excellent data quality and yet there are instabilities: is this a function of the integration mechanism or of overfitting?"
