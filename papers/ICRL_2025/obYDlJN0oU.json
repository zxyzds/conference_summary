    "title": "Massively Multi-Agents Reveal That Large Language Models Can Understand Value",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained over a large corpus of data, allowing them to learn internal representations of how humans would respond in different scenarios. This makes them well-suited for doing stock prediction, as stock prices are typically determined by human market participants reasoning on information that impacts the value of the stock. On the other hand, stock\nvaluation also requires the ability to understand numerical values, which LLMs are not known to be good at. In this work, we seek to study this limitation and use LLMs for the task of stock valuation. We introduce an agent-based simulation method MMARP (Massively Multi-Agents Role Playing), which simulates the responses for a large number of LLM agents over a range of numerical price values. Through experimental results, we find that while LLMs do not have a precise understanding of numerical stock price values individually, it is possible to surface reasonable stock price forecasts by tapping on their collective understanding of human behavior. By analyzing the interaction between the responses of LLM agents, we find that MMARP is able to obtain better forecasts than direct prompting of both general and financial LLMs, and deep-learning models for stock prediction.",

                "value": "This paper presents Massively Multi-Agents Role Playing (MMARP), a method that leverages the collective responses of many simulated language model agents to improve stock price prediction. Traditional LLMs struggle with understanding numerical values, which are essential for accurate stock valuation. MMARP addresses this by creating a simulation where each LLM agent acts with a distinct role, such as buyer or seller, across various price points and contextual settings. By analyzing the combined responses of these agents, MMARP approximates market dynamics, producing forecasts that outperform individual LLM predictions and other financial models. This approach highlights how LLMs, through collective behavior, can demonstrate an emergent understanding of complex, value-driven tasks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Limited Novelty: The approach lacks substantial innovation, as similar methods already use LLMs in agent-based financial simulations with more complex trading mechanisms, such as [1]. The MMARP framework primarily applies LLMs to give binary responses (e.g., cheap or expensive), which adds minimal novelty or depth to financial market simulations.\n\n2. Overclaims on Numerical Understanding: The paper\u2019s claims about advancing numerical understanding are overstated. The approach lacks clear differentiation between using multiple agents versus a single model for predictions, and it lacks theoretical support to demonstrate how the MMARP setup enhances numerical comprehension.\n\n3. Questionable Economic Assumptions: The demand-supply hypothesis may not be valid here, as all agents derive from the same model, sharing identical training data. This setup essentially replicates identical agents, which conflicts with the independent and diverse preferences central to economic theory.\n\n4. Unsubstantiated Multi-Agent Claim: While the paper emphasizes multi-agent interactions, the agents receive similar inputs, model parameters, and inference settings, leading to minimal agent diversity. This makes the simulation more akin to a single-agent system.\n\n5. Unclear Experimental Design: Although the paper discusses prompt designs and model selection, it lacks transparency regarding the exact inputs, outputs, and inference parameters. A detailed breakdown of these variables would clarify the MMARP method and support its reproducibility.\n\n6. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments, based on only 10 stocks over two years, may be insufficient to substantiate the claims. Additionally, key financial LLMs like FinMA and more diverse general-domain models were not included. Relying solely on information coefficient (IC) to assess performance limits the paper\u2019s ability to demonstrate improvements in numerical reasoning.\n\n[1] Gao, Shen, et al. \"Simulating financial market via large language model based agents.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.19966 (2024)."

Given that similar methods have applied LLMs for agent-based simulations with more advanced trading behaviors, could the authors clarify how MMARP\u2019s contribution significantly advances this area?\n\n2. Could the authors provide theoretical support or evidence that demonstrates how collective responses from agents address or enhance LLMs' numerical reasoning?\n\n3. Since all agents are based on the same LLM model with identical training data and input settings, how do the authors justify the use of demand-supply theory here?\n\n5. Would the authors expand to a larger dataset in multiple assets and different markets or including more diverse financial and general-purpose LLMs?"

Also, is the author's main purpose to propose an evaluation framework or to explore ways to improve the predictive performance of LLM in financial markets?\n\n2) The Background Section is not clear and related work is not comprehensive. In the Financial sector domain, there is a lot of recent work to explore LLM and LLM Agent's capacity in stock trading or financial decision-making:\n\n* [1] \"FinAgent: A Multimodal Foundation Agent for Financial Trading: Tool-Augmented, Diversified, and Generalist.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.18485 (2024). \n\n* [2] \"FinMem: A performance-enhanced LLM trading agent with layered memory and character design.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Symposium Series.

Meanwhile, the \"Agent-Based Simulation for Large Language Models\" subsection in the Background seems to be unrelated.\n\n3) The problem definition is not clear enough. The author mentions the use of the law of large numbers, but only shows the formula for the law of large numbers and then just provides an example to explain it. How to define the problem specifically according to the problem discussed in the paper, what the input is, what the output is, and how convergence is defined in this case? \n\n4) The authors discuss two aspects that affect the use of LLM for stock prediction in the abstract and introduction: a. simulating human behavior; b. the ability to understand numbers. However, the paper does not seem to discuss a. As the number of LLM outputs increases, so does the number of results for simulating more human behavior. How do the two interact with each other?\n\n5) Evaluation Metrics is not comprehensive. MSE performance is not consistently better than all baselines. Moreover, The commonly used indicators, Sharp Ration, Max Drop Down, ARR, were not included in this framework."

The paper hypothesizes that large language models (LLMs) lacks the capability to represent continuous numerical values in this task. Hence, it proposes the Massively Multi-Agents Role Playing method and tries to directly predict the stock price while the process is questionable. The method simulates the reactions of both buyers and sellers to various stock prices and contextual information. It generates the demand and supply curves by plots of reactions, then seemingly enables direct estimation of stock value using the intersection of two curves with insufficient explanation. The paper also notes the large computation load in simulation. It applies the discrete distributions of LLM outputs to simulating a large number of LLM agents , which is efficiently but lacking the comparison with regular methods.\n\nThe experiment shows that the prediction ability of the method approaches the state of the art. It analyses the demand curves by LLM agents of a range of prices and contexts. The results show that LLMs have a similar understanding of the numerical significance of stock value similar to economic demand theory."

Because the interactions between LLM agents cannot genuinely generate real stock price predictions without linear transformation.\n\n3. Specifically, the rationale for using a price prompt range of [-1, 1] is not explained, nor is there an explanation for the existence of the \u201cLLM value space\u201d.\n\n4. The differences of simulation\u2019s effect between regular method and the proposed method is not demonstrated. It is not shown whether the method of reducing computational load for simulating LLM agents yields results consistent with those from regular methods (directly use multi LLM agents).\n\n5.

A paper addressing LLMs' understanding of value should include broader experiments, such as algebraic problems, rather than focusing solely on stock price estimation.\n\nThere are some flaws in the experiment design. As we know, the output of the LLMs is heavily influenced by the context provided. The authors rely on limited stock information summaries to ask LLM make price estimation. However, this information does not represent the full range of data that influences stock prices in the real world. The LLM's output would be easily changed if we select news summary from another source or change the tone of this summary. Based on the experiment alone, it is presumptuous to conclude that LLMs understand values. Instead, the results only suggest that LLMs possess basic financial knowledge and can make context-based financial judgments."

It seems the authors treat the logit from the LLM as the ground truth probability for the tokens \"Expensive\" or \"Cheap,\" and then use simulation to generate results. Why is a simulation of 100,000 agents needed if the token distribution is already known? Additionally, it's unclear why the LLM\u2019s logit output would follow the law of large numbers. This is critical as it directly affect the paper\u2019s claims about \"a group of LLMs.\"\n\nThe term \"multi-agent\" in section 3.2 is overclaimed since only one additional agent is involved.
