    "title": "OpenWaves: A Large-Scale Anatomically Realistic Ultrasound-CT Dataset for Benchmarking Neural Wave Equation Solvers",
    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in computational physics, especially for wave imaging applications like ultrasound computed tomography (USCT), which reconstructs tissue properties from scattered waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for quasi-real-time imaging. Neural operators offer an innovative approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their effectiveness in realistic imaging is constrained by existing datasets that oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenWaves, a large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenWaves provides over 16 million frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations, featuring anatomically realistic human breast phantoms across four categories. It enables comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance, scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and extensive dataset, OpenWaves not only serves as a platform for developing innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in real-world medical imaging problems.",

Although Section 4.3.2 discusses the scaling property, the dataset's efficiency remains somewhat unclear. For example, as noted by the authors, the performance of different neural operators varies with dataset size, yet the underlying rationale and its implications for designing the proposed dataset require clarification."

                "value": "1) My primary concern pertains to the dataset generation. Despite a thorough review of the introduction and background, I find it unclear why generating this new dataset is particularly challenging. From my understanding, this dataset is generated purely through simulation. As long as one implements the wave equation according to the theoretical framework and generates the digital phantom via simulation tool, reproducing this dataset seems straightforward. From this perspective, the main contribution of this dataset appears to be its potential to save researchers time in regenerating these terabyte-scale data. Could the authors clarify this point?\n\n2) Furthermore, the differences between this dataset and existing datasets are not sufficiently discussed. While the manuscript notes that other datasets employ different imaging models, it would strengthen the work if the authors also discussed additional differences, such as scale, imaging applications, or computational complexity. Comments on the applicability of these datasets in comparison to the proposed dataset would also be beneficial.\n\n3) Since this paper focuses on medical applications of USCT, a purely simulated dataset (both the ground truth and measurements) may be seen as less important, particularly given that medical professionals often prioritize real data. I could not locate the evaluation criteria specifically for the dataset and benchmark track for ICLR. I am concerned whether such a purely simulated dataset meets ICLR's requirements."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of original contribution: This work does not appear to introduce any novel methods in dataset construction for ultrasound tomography. Creating such a dataset fundamentally depends on two aspects: the simulation algorithm and the generation or collection of breast phantoms. However, in this study, both are adopted from existing resources\u2014the VICTRE project for phantom generation and the Convergent Born Series (CBS) algorithm for wave field simulation. Consequently, this dataset could theoretically be reproduced by others with sufficient computational resources, given VICTRE and CBS, without any unique contribution from the authors.\n\n2. Insufficient discussion on parameter selection and real-world distribution: VICTRE requires a range of carefully chosen parameters to generate realistic breast phantoms, such as surface shape, internal compartmentalization, etc. However, this work does not discuss how parameters in OpenWave were selected or how their distributions might mirror real-world variability. Understanding these choices is essential for evaluating the fidelity of the benchmark and whether it can accurately assess the performance of different frameworks.\n\n3. Lack of quality control measures: Although VICTRE enables simulation of breast phantoms, these simulations inherently lack the complexities of real-world samples. The authors do not address how they ensured the quality or realism of the generated phantoms. For instance, was there any subsampling or external validation from clinical experts to assess the fidelity of these simulations? Such quality assessment is crucial for establishing the dataset as a reliable benchmark.\n\n4. Lack of support of breast type: What is the rationale behind the distribution of four breast types?1000:3000:2000:2000. Can authors provide the literature that supports the figure?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The current citation format is structured as though it serves as the subject of a sentence. To improve clarity and consistency, the authors should either use \\citep or add parentheses to the current citations.\n\n2. The authors frequently reference the 16M frequency-domain wave simulations to emphasize the dataset's large scale. However, this may be misleading. If my understanding is correct, each breast phantom has 256 sources, and during reconstruction, data from all sources would typically be required. I suggest that the authors represent the dataset size as either 8000 or 8000x8, which would provide a more accurate and meaningful metric for researchers."

Another apparent comparison I would do is (a. training with old datasets, model 1) versus (b. trianing with new datasets, model 2), this also needs real clinical data for justification.
