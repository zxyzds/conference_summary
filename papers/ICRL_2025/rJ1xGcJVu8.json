    "abstract": "In various scientific and engineering fields, the primary research areas have revolved around physics-based dynamical systems modeling and data-driven time series analysis. According to the embedding theory, dynamical systems and time series can be mutually transformed using observation functions and physical reconstruction techniques. Based on this, we propose Embedding Duality Theory, where the parameterized embedding layer essentially provides a linear estimation of the non-linear time series dynamics. This theory enables us to bypass the parameterized embedding layer and directly employ physical reconstruction techniques to acquire a data embedding representation. Utilizing physical priors results in a 10$\\times$ reduction in parameters, a 3$\\times$ increase in speed, and maximum performance enhancements of 18\\% in expert, 22\\% in zero-shot, and 53\\% in few-shot tasks without any hyper-parameter tuning. All methods are encapsulated as a plug-and-play module.",

                "value": "While the paper addresses an intriguing topic in time series modeling and proposes a novel approach, I found several aspects challenging to understand, especially regarding the theoretical foundation and the specific contributions of the proposed method. I am open to revising my review if further clarification is provided in response to my comments or if other reviewers offer insights that improve my understanding of the paper. Below, I outline my main concerns.\n\n1. The Embedding Duality Theory is the central theoretical contribution of this paper. However, I find the explanation of this theory quite vague. The description in lines 54-56 introduces Embedding Duality, but the mathematical foundation is not clearly established. Although Section 4.2 provides some theoretical results, the connection between these results and the Embedding Duality concept remains unclear. I would recommend a more rigorous and detailed mathematical formulation of Embedding Duality to clarify its implications and relationship to the results in Section 4.2.\n\n2. Regarding the proposed embedding techniques, I did not observe significant algorithmic innovation. Section 4.1 outlines several embedding methods (e.g., time delay embedding, principal component embedding, high-order derivatives), all of which are well-established in the field. Furthermore, there are important existing embedding techniques that are not mentioned in the paper, such as state space models and reservoir computing, which are also commonly used for capturing dynamics in time series data.\n\nIn conclusion, while the topic is interesting and relevant, the theoretical framework requires a clearer and more rigorous explanation, and the innovation in embedding techniques needs to be better established. I am open to revising my review if the authors can address these concerns and clarify the theoretical and algorithmic contributions."

Formal Definition of Embedding Duality Theory:\nThe Embedding Duality Theory is presented as a key theoretical contribution of the paper, but it lacks a formal mathematical definition. Could the authors provide a formal mathematical definition of Embedding Duality? How does this theory relate to existing theories?\n\n2. Connection Between Embedding Duality and Section 4.2 Results:\nSection 4.2 contains theoretical results, yet the connection between these results and Embedding Duality Theory is unclear. Could the authors explicitly explain how the results in Section 4.2 support, derive from, or are otherwise linked to the Embedding Duality Theory? Any clarification on this alignment would help in understanding the theoretical contributions.\n\n3. Innovation in Embedding Techniques:\nIn Section 4.1, the embedding methods discussed (such as time delay embedding, principal component embedding, and high-order derivatives) appear to be well-established. Could the authors clarify how the proposed physics-guided embeddings differ from or improve upon these traditional embedding methods? Are there any novel aspects in the application or combination of these techniques that enhance time series analysis? How does the approach compare to or differ from other modern embedding techniques, such as state space models and reservoir computing, which are known for capturing dynamics in time series data?"

Parameterized embeddings are unnecessary and introduce physics guided time series embeddings. Through prior theoretical and empirical work, they make the case for this.\n2. Physics-guided embeddings are more computationally efficient - they consistently maintain a good performance without meticulous hyper-parameter searching. The authors demonstrate this in Fig 7 by plotting performance versus speed.\n3. Physics-guided embeddings have the capacity to encapsulate richer and more essential information, consequently amplifying the performance. Implied from empirical experiments."

Clarification question: What is the usual size of parameterized embeddings and how does it compare to physics guided embeddings? based on my understanding, shifting and stacking time series data and their derivatives could yield very large embeddings.\n2. Follow up to 1: forecasting w.r.t. input length: one central advantage of using physics-guided embeddings is it runs faster. you also mention that longer inputs lead to better improvements. could you elaborate on what the memory requirements for using longer and longer inputs are? does the speed eventually stop improving (and potentially degrade) when the inputs are extremely long? how does this impact the performance?\n3. What was the rationale for including/introducing PC-Emb and ID-Emb in the main text when they were not being evaluated? If these results are not good, I would suggest putting them in the appendix/supplementary instead. Also, the page 4 discussion section is strangely placed and is required to justify exclusion of PC and ID methods. This should be rewritten somewhere else because there have been no results presented.\n4. Why is the covariance matrix used for PC-Emb? It is not clear from the manuscript. Please elaborate on why this is the case.\n5. Fig 4: why is parameterized embedding illustrated as PCA? Based on my understanding, the PCA embeddings are physics-guided embeddings as presented in section 4.\n6. Section 5.1 (visualization): Please justify why this part is necessary. Based on my understanding of the embeddings, it is trivial to see that using physics-guided embeddings capture the dynamical structure better because they use simple transforms/stacking of existing data - and therefore there will be patterns in the data.\n7. Section 5.1 (dim scaling law): Based on my understanding of the submission, the main point of the physics-guided embeddings is that it encapsulates intrinsic dynamical characteristics of the data. However, this part advocates for parameterized and could be irrelevant. Please justify why this part is relevant for the manuscript. \n8. Section 5.1 (causal-drectional modeling): Please explain what this part aims to show. I\u2019m confused why this is important. \n\nSome comments related to formatting and writing:\n- Page 2 (problem statement): What is dimension C? Please define.\n- Page 2 (problem statement): A brief description of how the encoder, embeddings, and decoder fit together in the deep learning model would help clear up confusion. At first glance, because the authors introduced embeddings then encoder then decoder, the reader will be confused whether this is different to standard deep learning paradigms.\n- Page 2 (problem statement): When introducing encoder, embedding, and decoder, it would be beneficial for the reader to describe what each component does. Also, what does \u201cserves as a flexible architecture mean?\u201d\n- Page 2 (encoder): What does SSM mean? Please define these abbreviations.\n- Figure 2: The figure is confusing because it is introduced before the different models are introudced. I would recommend either defining the methodsor placing this figure further down manuscript.\n- Page 3 (bottom): Typo - physic-guided embeddings -> physics guided embeddings\n- Section 4.2: There is lack of introduction and transitions between propositions, lemmas etc.. I would suggest describing the propositions/lemmas before stating them. There are also no transitions between the theory to conceptually connect them together. As a reader, I found it challenging to connect all the dots together.\n- Fig 5: There are no details of how the left subplots for parameterized embeddings were generated. what does number of iterations mean? Please explain how these experiments were set up.\n- Fig 5: The claim that physics guided embeddings have superior performance for downstream tasks is unwarranted because there have not been any results presented yet.\n- Section 5.1 and 5.3: There are signifcant portions of the experimental setup missing from this section. I understand some of this information is the appendix, but the main body of the paper is not self-sufficient to understand the basic experimental setup. Please include some form of description of the experimental setups.\n- Fig 8: the legends do not represent the colors and patterns of the bars. Please fix.\n- Section 5.2 (forecasting w.r.t. various embedding techniques): These are good observations. I would have loved to see a comparison (possibly tabular) indicating when each embedding should be used."

                "value": "### Organization and Framing\n\nThe paper\u2019s organization and framing are somewhat confusing. The main contribution seems to be an empirical evaluation of patching/embedding strategies (time delay, principal components of time delay, finite differences, and signal summation) that improve performance in models with smaller parameter counts. These strategies draw some mild inspiration from dynamical systems theory as a form of feature engineering to incorporate prior knowledge about sequences. This is a valid and valuable empirical contribution (discussed further later).\n\nHowever, the introduction and theoretical framing are largely disconnected from the methodology in Section 4 and the experiments in Section 5. Problem formulation in Section 2 lacks alignment with the experimental evaluation, and the claim of establishing empirical and theoretical connections between dynamical systems and time series seems tenuous. The \u201cembedding duality theory\u201d (e.g., Section 4.2) is mathematically ambiguous, and the concepts introduced may be better suited to be introduced after strong empirical evidence. This is fine if the scope of the work is to just test and report on some ideas for how to improve the predictive performance using less parameters, but is unsubstantiated as a main claim of the paper. \n\nI would suggest reframing the paper to start from the limitations of existing state-space and transformer models for time series (e.g., PatchTST) and why improvements in data augmentation or embedding are needed. The related work, especially Figure 3, already outlines some of this context. Following this, I guesses discuss how insights from dynamical systems inform these physics-guided embedding strategies, clarifying where they are effective or limited, and make the empirical case.\n\nIn Section 4.1, the formulation needs greater clarity. Please specify, mathematically, the exact input fed into the model as the embedding, particularly in the HD-Emb and ID-Emb sections, as this remains unclear. Including a section describing the architecture of existing state-space and transformer models and how your method builds on them may also help clarify.\n\nThe proposed strategies themselves are not novel; the use of integral and derivative signals for prediction has long been established in signal processing, dynamical systems, and time-series literature (for well over one hundred years). However, strong (positive or negative) empirical results could still offset this.\n\n### Experimental Section:\nRQ1 is insufficiently supported, as the embedding duality theory lacks precise definition. RQ2 and RQ3, however, are aligned with the experimental evaluations. Performance gains appear marginal overall (e.g., in Table 5) and inconsistent across datasets; for instance, electricity ETTh1 shows benefits with long sequences, while weather does not. While lines 378\u2013490 offer a brief explanation, a stronger link between data properties and empirical results would be valuable (e.g., reporting statistics about physical properties the sequences and their ultimate relation to performance w.r.t. to embedding strategy), and would support the hypothesis put forth about physics guided embeddings. Additionally, though the physics-guided embeddings reportedly reduce parameter counts, this is not thoroughly analyzed. I think a more extensive evaluation than just the 8 datasets would be useful to prove this case. Overall, the connection of key relations between the known physical properties/statistics of each dataset, and what is empirically observed in terms of performance across different tasks/embeddings strategies is not clear in this version of the manuscript.\n\n### Errata:\n- Line 155: physics-guided.\n- Line 161: Could you explain why $\\tau$ should appear in the dimension?\n- Line 171: multivariate"
