    "abstract": "Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients without requiring data sharing.\nHowever, conventional federated methods struggle with classification tasks in an unsupervised paradigm due to the absence of category knowledge.\nRecently, CLIP, a prominent visual language model, has demonstrated impressive results, particularly its remarkable zero-shot classification ability, which alleviates the dependence on labeled data.\nIn this paper, we first explore a new realistic problem, unsupervised federated learning using CLIP, where clients with unlabeled heterogeneous data collaborate to enhance global performance.\nTo address this problem, we propose FedPP, a method that incorporates a cooperative pseudo-label selection strategy and a partial prompt aggregation protocol.\nOur selection strategy ensures that all classes are trained in a balanced manner through global pseudo-label allocation.\nConcurrently, the aggregation protocol divides parameters into aggregated and retained components to optimize global performance while supporting local personalization.\nExtensive experiments across six datasets with various types of heterogeneity demonstrate the effectiveness of FedPP.\nOur code is available in the supplementary materials.",

However, in complex federated settings with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients, challenges like label skew, domain heterogeneity, and client-specific needs can still impact performance. Hence, the paper cannot use the word 'eliminate.'\n  - Line 077-080: The paper primarily focuses on image classification problems under unsupervised FL. Please refrain from claiming the problem to address is the unsupervised federated learning problem, which is a more prominent topic.\n\nC2:\n  - This paper selects reliable samples based on the median of confidence and entropy within the alternative set without any explanation of the alternative set. Hence, the paper must explain the meaning of the alternative set.\n  - Confidence-based filtering may include confidently incorrect predictions, especially if the model is biased towards certain classes due to imbalanced data. This can introduce pseudo-label errors, particularly in non-IID settings where client data distributions differ significantly. Hence, the paper must justify why the alternative set could help FedPP select reliable samples.\n  - The selection strategy of reliable samples is based on two thresholds, p_{1/2} and H_{1/2}. Hence, the paper needs to justify why such thresholds generalize across all clients or empirically prove the generalization of such threshold values.\n\nC3:\n  - Since pseudo-labels are generated based on CLIP's initial zero-shot predictions, they may need to be more accurate, especially in domain shifts or non-standardized data distributions across clients. However, reliable samples only mean the corresponding prediction labels are correct with high probability. Hence, even if reliable samples are picked correctly, the paper still needs to justify why selected reliable samples represent the local data distribution.\n\nC4:\n  - If the estimated pseudo-labeling distribution is highly similar to the true label distribution as expected, uploading such information to the server introduces additional security concerns since threat models may utilize such information to conduct attacks like data distribution inference attacks. Hence, the paper must justify that the system design would not lead to privacy issues.\n\n**Writing Issues**\n\n  1. Abstract\uff1a The abbreviation 'CLIP' is not explained.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main limitation of the paper is the lack of theoretical analysis. FedPP introduces significant differences in training compared to previous baselines, which could impact training convergence, communication complexity, and privacy concerns. However, none of these issues are discussed in detail. Specifically, the following points require further clarification:\na) Communication Cost: In FedPP, clients incur an additional cost by uploading the estimated pseudo-label distribution $U_k^{est}$, while avoiding the need to upload textual prompts since only visual prompts are aggregated by the server. How do these changes impact the overall communication cost? From a complexity perspective, is FedPP more or less efficient than other methods?\nb) Training Convergence: If clients update both visual and textual prompts locally but only visual prompts are aggregated by the server, can FedPP guarantee convergence? How does the convergence speed of FedPP compare to that of other methods?\nc) Privacy Concerns: The uploaded pseudo-label distribution $U_k^{est}$ could potentially reveal statistics about local data, as it is derived from high-confidence samples. This raises concerns that FedPP may pose a higher risk to client privacy compared to traditional federated learning methods, which only share model weights. Is there theoretical evidence to demonstrate that FedPP does not compromise client privacy?\n2. The paper highlights the two modules in FedPP as key contributions. However, the Partial Prompt Aggregation (PPA) module can be simply summarized as aggregating only the visual part of the prompts on the server, and the aggregation method used in FedPP is essentially the same as prior federated approaches that rely on local data capacity for aggregation. Limited novelty and innovation is shown with this module. Furthermore, although Figure 3 demonstrates that the experimental divergence on textual prompt is more significant than that on visual prompt, it remains under-explored why aggregating only visual prompts leads to performance improvement compared to previous methods that tend to aggregate both prompts. Here some in-depth exploration to justify this aggregation approach is important for understanding but unfortunately is not provided. \n3. The paper also contains numerous mathematical notation and spelling errors, impacting the readability to some extent. For example, in Equations (3) and (4), the symbol $i$ is used without explanation. It seems to represent client indexes, but the paper mentions that this is denoted by $k$. Additionally, in Tables 1 and 2, \"zero shot\" is misspelled as \"zore shot.\" Furthermore, in appendix, there are also several symbol errors in Algorithm 1, such as $k \\in M_t$ on line 9 and the inconsistent use of $p_\\alpha$ and H_\\alpha$ on line 16. Equation 2 shows $p_{1/2}$ and $H_{1/2} instead."

The aggregated global  pseudo-labeling distribution is sent back to the server for ensuring uniform training across all categories.
