    "title": "HyperFace: Generating Synthetic Face Recognition Datasets by Exploring Face Embedding Hypersphere",
    "abstract": "Face recognition datasets are often collected by crawling Internet and without individuals' consents, raising  ethical and privacy concerns. Generating synthetic datasets for training face recognition models has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the generation of synthetic datasets remains  challenging as it entails adequate inter-class and intra-class variations. While advances in generative models have made it easier to increase intra-class variations in face datasets (such as pose, illumination, etc.), generating sufficient inter-class variation is still a difficult task. In this paper, we formulate the dataset generation as a packing problem on the embedding space (represented on a hypersphere) of a face recognition model and propose a new synthetic dataset generation approach, called HyperFace. We formalize our packing problem as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient descent-based approach. Then, we use a conditional face generator model to synthesize face images from the optimized embeddings. We use our generated datasets to train face recognition models and evaluate the trained models on several benchmarking real datasets. Our experimental results show that models trained with HyperFace achieve state-of-the-art performance in training face recognition using synthetic datasets.",

Limited scale: While the experiments on datasets with up to 30K identities provide valuable insights, evaluating the method's performance on significantly larger datasets is crucial.  Datasets with 100K and 300K identities would be particularly informative as they would reveal how the method scales and whether performance degrades with increased identity count and potential data noise. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and real-world applicability.\n2. Narrow focus:  The paper's focus on improving inter-class variation is important, but expanding the scope to address intra-class variability would significantly enhance its impact. Specifically, exploring how the method handles variations in pose, illumination, and expression within the same identity would be valuable. Additionally, investigating the method's robustness to occlusions or image quality degradation would further strengthen the evaluation and demonstrate its potential for real-world scenarios."

It\u2019s important to compare against SOTA (e.g. DCFace) at scale (i.e. increasing the number of identities). Specifically, table 3 should not be just an ablation study but you need to show that your method scales favorably and/or outperforms SOTA as the number of training images increases. \n5. In general, how the method scales has been poorly studied (there\u2019s only 1 result in table 3). Scaling Dataset Generation section discusses computational issues that may arise from scaling the dataset but does not provide concrete numbers (e.g. a figure showing training time vs dataset size), conclusions or practical solutions (i.e. a solution is proposed but not put in practice)\n6. Baselines: what about direct comparison with arc2face? Since they don\u2019t have to solve your optimisation problem, they can generate a lot more images for training"

[Major] This paper adopts Arc2Face for final image generation. However, (1) The ablation study doesn't show the advance of directly sending random feature embedding (each embedding is ensured by restricting the similarity below a certain threshold, e.g. 0.3) to Arc2Face; (2) The comparison with Arc2Face is missing in Table 1, additionally the experiment is marginal better than DCFace. The average performance is 89.876 which is similar to DCFace and dramatically lower than Arc2Face. \n\n3. [Major] In Section 'Solving the HyperFace Optimization', the authors choose AdamW for the optimization solution. However, the other alternative optimization methods are not specified and compared in this paper.\n\n4. Another concern is that the proposed method generates more images(640k) to produce similar performance to DCFace (500k).\n\n5. large intra-class variations can not be observed in the visualization section.\n\n6.

However, the paper lacks evidence, analysis, or experiments demonstrating that Equation 1 is minimized by this uniform distribution. See [1] for more details.\n\n2. Use of Hyperspherical Points: One key aspect of the method is the use of uniformly positioned points on the hypersphere. While using a pre-trained FR model for generating the identity gallery is reasonable, it would be helpful to see results without applying HyperFace (using pure FR embedding as condition). How would this affect the results?\n\n3. Experimental Section: The experiments section needs major revisions. Most of the subsections only report table results without in-depth discussion or analysis. For a conference of ICLR\u2019s quality, it\u2019s important to explain specific behaviors and insights from the proposed method.\n\n4. Additional Experiments: Additional experiments could improve clarity on the benefits of the method. For example, while Table 3 presents an ablation study on the number of identities on FR performance, it would also be valuable to show how many novel identities the method can generate (what is the saturation point for the number of novel identities). \n\n5. Identity Leakage: The paper mentions identity leakage but lacks in-depth experiments on the synthesized data. What would the performance look like if synthesized images with high similarity to real datasets (e.g., CASIA) were excluded?"
