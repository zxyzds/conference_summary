    "title": "Fragment-Augmented Diffusion for Molecular Conformation Generation",
    "abstract": "Molecular conformer generation is a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry, particularly for large and complex molecules. \nIn this work, we propose a novel approach called Fragment-Augmented Diffusion (FADiff), which integrates molecular fragmentations into diffusion models as a data augmentation strategy to enhance molecular conformation generation. By decomposing molecules into smaller, manageable fragments for the purpose of data augmentation, FADiff enhances the diffusion generation process, effectively capturing local structural variations while preserving the integrity of the entire molecule. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FADiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, where the fragment-based augmentation approach significantly enhances model performance. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of different fragmentation rules and their impact on model performance, and theoretically validate FADiff's effectiveness in improving generalization. Overall, FADiff advances molecular conformation generation by enhancing the exploration of conformational space, offering a powerful tool for computational chemistry. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/fragaug-5960/.",

                "value": "This paper proposes to improve diffusion model\u2019s generalizability by augmenting training datasets with a wide range of fragment-level configurations. The fragments used for augmentations are selected to be chemically valid, while preserving essential properties of the original molecule. The authors provide justification for approximating the labels for fragments with the concept of mutual information. Given the augmented dataset, FADiff outperforms previous baseline models for molecule conformer generation. The model architecture and training scheme itself follows that of Torsional Diffusion, and has no novelty."

How are the conflicting representations in such cases handled? \n- The two fragmentation methods (RECAP, BRICS) cover similar chemical deconstruction. In cases where the two fragmentation methods yield overlapping fragments within the same molecule, how is it processed? How did the authors deal with potential data bias for frequently observed fragments? \n- Selecting the right fragmentation method is indeed important, but the authors fail to sufficiently explain how the selected fragmentation methods optimal considering error variance. Provide quantitative elaboration on error analysis according to fragmentation methods.\n- The model lacks comparison with more recent generative models for molecule conformer generation. The following models should be added as baseline models.\n1. DiSCO: Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge for Molecular Conformer Optimization (Lee et al., 2024)\n2. Equivariant Flow Matchiing for Molecular Conformer Generation (Hassan et al., 2024)\n3. Swallowing the Bitter Pill: Simplified Scalable Conformer Generation (Wang et al., 2024)\n\n\nMinor Questions\n- Provide statistics of the augmented datasets on components (e.g. number of fragments, average length, average fragment generated from each molecule).\n- Can this data augmentation method be model agnostic and be applied to other generative models as well?\n- The main results are evaluated upon the train/val/test splits setup from TorDiff but significant variation is present in the result of GEOM-DRUGS. Why is the dataset not reproducible unlike other datasets (GEOM-QM9, XL)?\n- Appendix Figure 2 requires more explanation and connection to the main text.\n- Authors additionally used conformer matching method, to align ground truth conformers with synthetic RDKit generated conformers. Also validate the effect of this data augmentation technique."

This work closely follows the previous Torsional Diffusion work (Jing et al., 2022), which considers performing diffusion on torsion angles instead of atom coordinates to reduce the degree of freedom. \n\nWith the context, the main contribution of this work is to propose to use the molecular fragmentation as augmented data for the Torsional Diffusion training (Fragment-Augmented Diffusion, i.e., FADiff). Specifically, given a molecule in the training set, FADiff first decomposes the molecule into multiple fragments and then treats each fragment (that satisfies some criterias) as separate training data. The 3D structures of these augmented fragments are \u201ccropped\u201d from the 3D structures of the original molecule where the fragments come from. The experiments on conformer generation shows that FADiff can outperform the previous Torsional Diffusion work."

Several questions remain unanswered. \n- The torsion angles in a molecule are determined by the global structure rather than its local structure in the decomposed fragment. Why augmenting the training with local 3D structures cropped from the global structures can help the performance, given that all the local structure information is contained in the global structure?\n- How can we demonstrate that if the performance gain indeed comes from the data augmentation or it is because the model architecture in the original Torsional Diffusion constrains the learning from the local structure?\n- The REAL structures for fragments are unknown. By using the structures cropped from the global structures as the local structures for training, would this mislead the model on learning the underlying physics?"
