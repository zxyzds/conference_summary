    "title": "GTR: Semi-supervised Learning with Grouping and Transporting for Robust Thresholding",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) digs unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling when labeled data is limited. Despite various auxiliary strategies enhancing SSL training, the main challenge is how to determine reliable pseudo labels through a robust thresholding algorithm based on quality indicators (e.g., confidence scores). However, the existing strategies for distinguishing low or high-quality labels through simple grouping indicators remain in trivial design, ignoring the characteristics of the data distribution itself, which cannot guarantee robustness and efficiency. To this end, we group the quality indicators of pseudo labels into three clusters (easy, semi-hard, and hard) and statistically reveal the real bottleneck of threshold selection, i.e., the sensitivity of semi-hard samples, through empirical analysis. We propose an adaptive Grouping and Transporting method that Robustly selects semi-hard samples with test-time augmentations and consistency constraints while saving the selection budgets of easy and hard samples, dubbed as GTR. Our proposed GTR can effectively determine high-quality data when applied to existing SSL methods while reducing redundant costs in the selection. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL benchmarks across three modalities verify that GTR can achieve significant performance gains and speedups over Pseudo Label, FixMatch, and FlexMatch.",

The paper claims that the latest methods for distinguishing low or high-quality labels require complex-designed thresholding strategies but still fail to guarantee robust and efficient selection. In addressing this issue, the GTR model exhibits an amalgamation of data grouping/clustering, optimal transportation, test-time augmentations, and consistency regularization, a combination that endows the method with superior performance in comparison to baseline methods."

The paper could have a further explanation of the methods TTA,  threshold settings, consistency constraints, and how these methods are applied to the model, a factor which could be helpful for fully understanding the proposed method. \n\nW4. The empirical evidence presented in the paper lacks persuasiveness. A substantial performance boost could have justified the paper's simplicity and application-oriented nature. However, the minor improvement over baselines, as indicated primarily in experiments, does not substantiate the approach's effectiveness convincingly. In addition, no code has been released or noted in the paper.\n\nW5. The notation $T$ in Lines 285, 293, 295, etc. need more clarification."

                "value": "The main weaknesses of the paper can be summarized as follows.\ni) Although I understand the general idea, I had difficulty understanding the details regarding implementation. There a lot of missing details, notation problems and unexplained terms throughout the paper, and  the paper is written badly from this perspective. The following details must be explained more:\n-- The authors must first explain the general network used for learning. They mention from the student network in a few places. Did the authors use a teacher student network training pipeline in the paper?\n-- There are terms that are not explained in the equations. For examples, the first term after summation operation in Equations 2 and 4.\n-- I did not understand how the authors implement transporting, what is done in that step? How the semi-hard and easy distributions are aligned and how this alignment is used for training?\n-- What is the purpose of filtering defined in Section 3.2?\n-- What is the dimension d of the z vector used in Equation 5?\nii) The figures are misleading. In Figure 1, confidence scores are used in left part whereas reward score distributions are used on the right. As far as we understand from the text, they are different, therefore comparing confidences to reward scores does not make sense. Confidence score or reward scores must be used for both cases.\niii) Figures 2 and 3 conflict each other. In figure 2, it seems both easy and semi-hard indicator values are sensitive to thresholding, yet in figure 3, only semi-hard indicator values are sensitive to thresholding.\niv) Experimental evaluations is not fair. One cannot use a pre-defined network trained on ImageNet for training a semi-supersived training on ImageNet, STL and Cifar 100 datasets. The network already seen all the examples of ImageNet dataset during training. Fine-tuning a semi supervised learning algorithm from this pre-trained network is a clear violation of a fair testing procedure. Also why different networks are used for different datasets (e.g., why the authors do not use FlexMatch for the test reported in Table 3 although it I used for ImageNet dataset or why FixMatch is not used in Table 2?)\nv) The authors must also report the state-of-the-art accuracies obtained the tested datasets.\n\nMinor Issue: there are some minor typos such as in the title of Section 3.2 that must be corrected."

Then, multiple selection and consistency constraints are used to reduce the uncertainty of semi-hard samples and improve the accuracy of pseudo labels. As shown in Figure 1(a), the separation boundaries (yellow lines) of various classes are different. Therefore, will the proposed method lead to class imbalance due to the selection of reliable pseudo labeled data, thereby reducing the model's generalization ability.\n2. In the transportation section, is the number of easy groups kept constant? Is the number of hard groups constantly decreasing as the high-scoring half of the data is assigned to the semi-hard group in the next iteration? Will this setting result in minimal hard data that can be ignored and increase the low scores of data in semi-hard groups? How is the final equation of unlabeled loss obtained? The description of this part is lacking.\n3. The introduction of Equation 6 seems abrupt, authors claim that the Mahalanobis distance is used to assess the fit of pseudo-labels, with larger distances indicating lower reliability, which guides thresholding decisions. However, the threshold decision has been given in the transporting mechanism, and introducing Mahalanobis distance seems meaningless.\n4. In the experiment, this manuscript demonstrates that the proposed method can reduce training time, but does not provide theoretical analysis."
