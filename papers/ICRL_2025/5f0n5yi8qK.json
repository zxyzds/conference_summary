    "title": "Training Open-ended Policies to follow Video-prompt Instructions with Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, online reinforcement learning(RL) training methods like PPO have shone in important works such as Instruct GPT. However, unlike the success achieved in the language domain, online RL methods often struggle to generalize to untrained tasks in open-world environments like Minecraft, due to issues like overfitting. This has become a significant obstacle in using online methods to build a generalist agent. In this work, we notice the modality differences between natural language environments and embodied environments such as the Minecraft environment, which inspired us to use video instructions instead of text instructions to enhance the model's understanding of the relationship between the environment and instructions. We also introduce a new attention layer in the base model's encoder-decoder architecture to establish a semantic and visual dual-path information interaction channel, further strengthening this generalization capability. After training our model on a small set of tasks, it demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalization on new tasks, outperforming almost all other models in the Minecraft environment on our benchmark. Our approach takes a solid and important step toward unleashing the potential of online RL in building generalist agents.\nzero-shot generalization on new tasks, outperforming almost all other models in\nthe Minecraft environment on our benchmark.

                "value": "By providing the agent with a video of the task it needs to perform, the agent is given a step-by-step demonstration of what is expected, and must only learn to parse the action sequence contained in the human-provided video prompt at inference time.\n\nDoing this is not entirely without merit: this may well be a non-trivial problem to solve if the prompt is out of distribution with respect to the training data. \n\nHowever, I am not convinced that solving this problem is at all relevant to open-endedness: the proposed agent relies on being provided a concrete sequence of actions to take (contained in the video), but that is precisely what one hopes that agents can discover autonomously.\n\nIn other words, access to the video prompts that would be required in this set up does not seem feasible in practice, so I fail to understand the real-world relevance of this technical contribution. \n\nThe reason language prompts are prevalent in the literature is because natural language allows conveying arbitrarily abstract ideas, so requiring natural language prompting is a less strict limitation, as long as the agent can interpret abstract goals. (Though this is still debatable, as ultimately open-endedness is about creating new goals.)\n\nIn order to strengthen these results, the authors would have to argue how obtaining these video prompts without human intervention would happen, and how this would still be relevant despite the limitations of imitation learning. For example, in a multi-agent setting, one could show that one can build an agent that wanders observing other players, scores what interesting new observed skills to learn, and utilizes the proposed methodology to internalize these skills.\n\nI have a few other qualms with the methodology and soundness of the claims, but these seem second-order considerations given the above.\n\nI may well have misunderstood the motivation and relevance of the work. If this is the case, perhaps the authors can clarify the problem statement and any other relevant details to highlight the relevance of the contributions to the field of open-ended reinforcement learning, and I would be very happy to re-assess their technical contributions more fairly.\n\nI also encourage the authors to improve their writing and organization of the manuscript."

For instance, the authors should clarify the settings for \"with Attention\" and \"No Attention\" in the ablation study on intention-aware attention.\n\n2. In the ablation analysis of intention-aware attention, it appears that \"No Attention\" is equivalent to the base policy model GROOT. If this is not the case, has the proposed method refactorized the projection of latent z to address the limited feature dimension for enhancing generalization?\n \n3. The ablation section on the base policy contains some confusing aspects regarding the baseline policy. The paper states, \"Given GROOT\u2019s outstanding ability to follow video instructions, we chose it as our base policy\" (line 175). It seems that GROOT is intended as the comparison baseline in the ablation for the base policy. However, the analysis compares the dual-pathway architecture to STEVE1 and STEVEv, which is not a fair comparison since the dual-pathway architecture is not the only controlled variable between STEVE and the proposed model.\n\n$\\textbf{Additional experimental analysis:}$\nI recommend including an ablation study on the KL term \"between the current policy and the original policy,\" as this would further validate the effectiveness of the KL constraint for the agent.\n\nWhile the proposed method shows promising direction to enhancing the generalization capabilities of video instruction-based online RL, the paper lacks clarity regarding key components, such as the policy model architecture. This causes limitations in both the reproducibility and readability of the proposed method. Furthermore, some experimental settings are not normative to ablation study, or lack a detailed analysis of each design (e.g., objective function). The above reasons lead me to conclude that the current version of the manuscript is not suitable for publication; therefore, my rating tends to be below the accepted threshold."

Also, the goal space should appear somewhere in the definition of the reward function $R: S \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, right? Also, $t$ and $g$ should be italicized on the last line of Section 2.1. \n- Section 3.2 is redundant, it just specifies the standard PPO update rules. \n- On the other hand, the reward function that is used is not defined anywhere. Other methods like MineCLIP use the similarity between the embeddings of the image observations and textual instructions. But here, the paper says it is using video instructions. Is some kind of analogous reward defined, consisting of the similarity between instruction embeddings and the observation embeddings? \n- More generally, the proposed algorithm should be clearly described someplace. Please add some pseudocode or a detailed diagram (Figure 2 does not show any rewards, and my understanding is that this is not the proposed model but a baseline). It would be good to have the learning objetives spelled out somewhere (my understanding is the the reward function is the sum of multiple goal-conditioned rewards?)\n- What is the demonstration data used? How many trajectories/frames does it consist of? All I see in the paper is the sentence \u201cWe recorded each task\u2019s instruction videos manually and generated them using the model, showcasing the player successfully performing the correct actions on the target objects.\u201d Do you also have textual instructions for all these demonstrations? How are you training the baselines to ensure they all have access to the same data for a consistent comparison?\n\nMinor:\n- Section 2 title: \u201cPreliminary\u201d should be \u201cPreliminaries\u201d. \n Line 047: \u201cIn this work. We draw...\u201d is not a proper sentence. \n- References are not properly formatted, see line 035 for example. \n- Figure 3\u2019s caption says \u201cDraft\u201d and parentheses are not matched. \n- Line 379: \u201cGeneralization\u201d is misspelled. \n- The list of typos above is not exhaustive, there are others throughout the paper.
