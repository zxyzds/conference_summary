    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the practical utility of grokking, a phenomenon where\nmodels generalize long after overfitting the training data. This offers a promising\navenue for training on changing distributions, especially in data-scarce environ-\nments. We investigate a scenario where a model grokked on a distribution p1 is\nutilized to grok another model on a different distribution p2, particularly in a data\ncrunch situation on the p2 distribution. We further explore distilling multiple small\nmodels grokked on different distributions to generalize a larger model. This ap-\nproach is crucial where data is scarcely available for these different distributions,\nthus saving computational resources. Finally, we present a setup for continually\npretraining a grokked model from distribution p1 to p2. Our experiments reveal\nthat distilling from a grokked model provides quick generalization over the cur-\nrent task while simultaneously alleviating the forgetting of previous knowledge.\nWe analyze these scenarios over various algorithmic tasks such as addition, sub-\ntraction, and multiplication. Our results provide a framework for efficient model\ntraining in dynamic and data-limited scenarios, enabling the development of more\nrobust, adaptable systems.",

                "value": "The reviewer has the following major concerns, and therefore leans on a rejection.\n\n1. Conclusion not very surprising: regarding the finding-(1) in the above summary, when distilling a grokked model trained on a task p1 to a student model training on another task p2, it is shown that the student model is easier to generalize (acceleration of grokking) and the required data for p2 is below critical data size. However, the authors use tasks whose differences are only up to the modulus P (if the reviewer understands correctly). It is intuitive that such a KD process can inject some bias (or act as some \u2018pre-training\u2019) that facilitates the generalization on a similar task p2. Did the authors try to transfer to other tasks such as changing the binary operators?\n2. Part of the conclusion is not new: regarding the finding-(2) in the above summary, existing works already showed with counterexamples that a decreasing weight norm may not be causally related to grokking, see examples in [1][2]. \n3. The experimental setup lacks justification: \n    - the reviewer is confused about the experimental setup, specifically why the training is performed in 30000 epochs and the data fraction is 30%/20%/10%? Are these used in some prior works?\n    - In section 5, the authors show that training a \u2018larger\u2019 model on a joint distribution of two tasks does not lead to grokking, but training two models on each task individually and distilling the two models into a \u2018larger\u2019 model allows for grokking. Why should one care about this setup? What is its implication?\n4. The writing can be improved. \n    - For example, figure 1 is not mentioned in the text if the reviewer is not mistaken. In addition, many parts in the paper miss critical citations for a smooth reading (e.g. row 48, 50-51, 201-207)\n    - More intuition or explanation on why a set of experiments is conducted and why the use of KD objective makes a difference, would be greatly helpful.\n5. Practical implication: the paper is motivated to consider a low-data regime (subject to security protocols and privacy regulations) for the purpose of facilitating generalization under limited data conditions, however, the reviewer had a hard time connecting the toy setting with the real-world applications. Specifically, the authors seem not to verify that a grokked model can reduce the delay generalization on the student model for a broad range of tasks.\n\n[1] Grokking as the transition from lazy to rich training dynamics.

At row 184, it is implied that P is a constant modulus, but at row 190, P is referred to as the last token of the model\u2019s output, which is not consistent."

Specifically, the authors use knowledge distillation from previously grokked models as an additional loss term to regularize their model.

                "value": "I have several concerns regarding the experiments and the math notations:\n1. Section 3: the authors use P for modulo operation and use small p for distribution notation which is confusing. In line 196, they describe the input space whereas they describe the distribution before that. The distribution is also confusing. What is the random variable here? How do the input data live in d dimensional space as mentioned in Line 196. They use the term `distribution' loosely everywhere.\n\n2. Figures: it seems the model's accuracy is at 0% before grokking which is confusing to me. What is the chance accuracy here? Did the model learn anything at all? I would change the color scheme in Figure 3. It took me a lot of effort to distinguish among the shades and linestyles of green.\n\n3. Section 4: I would elaborate more on the bullet points regarding the advantages of KD and how they relate to the current work. Referring to other works is unhelpful.\n\n4. The paper shows empirical evidence on a selected dataset. As they do not have any theoretical guarantee, without elaborate experiments on a broad range of datasets, raises concerns for overfitting to a particular case.\n\n5. I did not understand the experiment description in Page 7. The statement in Line 375 goes against their Figure 1 (b) top right panel. what is $f_M$ tested on in all the plots?\n\n6. Continual learning experiment: The terminology `pretraining' is confusing for continual learning (CL) setup. They consider a narrow setup with two tasks only. The experiment description is not clear and I could not understand their hypothesis and finding after investing a significant time to grok it. CL setups are not useful unless they have a lot of tasks (~100-1000) in the learning environment. We want to look at the long term behavior of the CL algorithms. CL systems are complex and there many performance statistics to consider while proposing a CL setup. I would solely focus on the single task experiments and address the CL setup in a different paper.\n\n7. What is the impact of similarity between p1 and p2 on the grokking? I would explore the effect of task similarity and review the transfer learning literature.\n\n8. The author only mentions percentage of total data in experiments everywhere without mentioning the total sample size. Without knowing the actual sample size, it is impossible to know how low that data percentage is."
