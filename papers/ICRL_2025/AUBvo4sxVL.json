    "abstract": "Material discovery is a critical research area with profound implications for various industries. In this work, we introduce MatExpert, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning to accelerate the discovery and design of new solid-state materials. Inspired by the workflow of human materials design experts, our approach integrates three key stages: retrieval, transition, and generation. First, in the retrieval stage, MatExpert identifies an existing material that closely matches the desired criteria. Second, in the transition stage, MatExpert outlines the necessary modifications to transform this material formulation to meet specific requirements outlined by the initial user query. Third, in the generation state, MatExpert performs detailed computations and structural generation to create a new material based on the provided information. Our experimental results demonstrate that MatExpert outperforms state-of-the-art methods in material generation tasks, achieving superior performance across various metrics including validity, distribution, and stability. As such, MatExpert represents a meaningful advancement in computational material discovery using langauge-based generative models.",

                "value": "1. The design of MatExpert mirrors the expert-driven process in material science, breaking down material generation into retrieval, transition, and generation stages. This structured approach allows for iterative refinement.\n\n2. The transition stage uses a CoT reasoning process, enabling the model to outline logical, step-by-step modifications to meet target properties. This sequential reasoning contributes to the model's ability to achieve high accuracy in conditional generation tasks.\n\n3. By compiling a dataset of over 2 million materials from NOMAD, MatExpert provides a large-scale testbed to assess its performance."

While the multi-stage design of MatExpert improves accuracy, it adds computational complexity and potentially increases training time compared to single-step models. \n\n2. The proposed framework will have cumulative errors. If the result retrieved in the first step is far away from the target, it will be difficult to correct it later, thus affecting the results of subsequent steps.\n\n3. This paper focuses on innovation in application scenarios, and the technological innovation is relatively limited."

There are three stages to the MatExpert methodology: retrieval, transition, and generation. First, a material is retrieved from the database that most closely matches the description given (similarly was trained with contrastive learning). Next during transition, the model determines how to alter the retrieved material to match the desired properties. Lastly, in the generation phase the model produces a ALX representation that is converted into a CIF representation. The main contribution of the paper is the MatExpert framework and the accompanying benchmarking and ablation study."

Also, there are 11 bars but only 9 labels, not sure if I missed something? The colors are very similar in some cases, hard to parse quickly.   \n- There is no discussion on the limitations of using the retrieval stage. My interpretation is that the retrieved material is like a template. Before generative models, new materials were searched for using templating/substitution methods. One of the critiques of those methods is that materials generated are still quite similar to the template, would that also be a limitation here?"

The authors might find [4] useful as a reference for evaluating the quality and safety of generated pathways.\n* Due to the complexity of multi-steps framework, the paper could discuss more on how the authors prevent the error propagation.\n* The visualization for Figure 6 is not clear enough.

For unconditional generation, we randomly select a material from the database during the first stage of MatExpert.\u201d According to the second referred sentence, the second, transition stage would take samples of training set embeddings or raw data would be given as input. This is contradictory to the claim that no structure or property is given to generate. For this reason, I believe the evaluation scheme is unfair. Please fix me in the author response if I understood incorrectly.\n\n2.  Following this concern, the performance improvement on generation is also questionable. The authors are encouraged to provide stabilities (Predicted energy over convex hull values, or DFT relaxation success rate) of the generated samples that are out-of-distribution. Also, stability measurements on Table 2 are also needed.\n\n3. There are stronger baselines following the CDVAE research, as the authors stated. However, comparisons between them, which is necessary, are missing in Table 1.  Furthermore, the authors also need to specify which dataset was used, or, the source of the CDVAE model. If the CDVAE model is trained only on MP-20, that would not be a fair comparison."
