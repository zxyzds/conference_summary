    "title": "InsightBench: Evaluating Business Analytics Agents Through Multi-Step Insight Generation",
    "abstract": "Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents\u2019 ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics",

Some of the data is made up, and some is real, to make it feel like actual business situations. They also came up with their own AI agent called AgentPoirot, which did better than other AI tools at figuring out different kinds of insights from the data.\n\nTo make sure anyone can use and improve on their work, the team used an open-source AI called LLaMA-3 to judge how well the AI agents do. They hope this will help push forward the development of AI that can do complete data analysis for businesses without needing humans to guide it every step of the way."

One suggestion might be to further split up the datasets into Happy path and Challenge datasets, with challenge datasets using less synthetic data, and being more realistic of real world scenarios.\n1. Dependency on structure: InsightBench focuses on structured, tabular data, but increasingly other data formats like unstructured text, images, or complex graphs are becoming relevant for business analytics.\n1.

It was also clever to use the real-world data schema from a popular troubleshooting ticketing platform, ServiceNow, which ensures the applicability of this approach.\n\n3) Using LLaMA-3-Eval as an alternative to GPT-4 which is a closed API.

However, this notion of four types of analytics was not as prevalent in the later part, where the results were presented. Consider looping back to these four types of analytics when presenting the results and performance.\n\n3) I understand Pandas Agent is probably the most popular agent aiming to achieve similar goals. However, I would like to see the comparison against some other agents, if there are any.\n\n4) This paper focuses too much on showing the strengths of the benchmark and the specialized agent, Agent Poirot.

This value looks interesting to me. Do you know why the agent works best at such a low temperature?\n\n3) It was encouraging to see that LLaMa-3-Eval produced consistent outcomes compared to G-Eval, which is known to be well aligned with human judgments.
