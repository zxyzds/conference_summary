    "title": "Two-Step Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning with Constrained Actions",
    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) in the offline setting has succeeded greatly in industrial applications such as chatbots. A two-step learning framework where one applies a reinforcement learning step after a reward modeling step has been widely adopted for the problem. However, such a method faces challenges from the risk of reward hacking and the complexity of reinforcement learning. To overcome the challenge, our insight is that both challenges come from the state-actions not supported in the dataset. Such state-actions are unreliable and increase the complexity of the reinforcement learning problem at the second step. Based on the insight, we develop a novel two-step learning method called PRC: preference-based reinforcement learning with constrained actions. The high-level idea is to limit the reinforcement learning agent to optimize over a constrained action space that excludes the out-of-distribution state-actions. We empirically verify that our method has high learning efficiency on various datasets in robotic control environments.",

                "value": "The author discusses the success of preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) in offline settings, particularly in industrial applications like chatbots. A common approach in this area is a two-step learning framework, where reinforcement learning follows a reward modeling step. However, this method faces challenges related to reward hacking and the complexity of reinforcement learning. The author identifies that these challenges stem from state-actions not supported by the dataset, as these state-actions are unreliable and complicate the learning process. To address this issue, the author proposes a novel method called PRC (preference-based reinforcement learning with constrained actions), which limits the reinforcement learning agent to optimizing within a constrained action space that excludes out-of-distribution state-actions. The method is empirically shown to achieve high learning efficiency across various robotic control datasets."

The primary innovation in this work lies in the use of a constrained action space. However, 1) this modification to the original PBRL objective appears to be marginal, and 2) the paper lacks both theoretical and principled justification for the overall performance improvements.\n2. **Ambiguous Experimental Results.**\nSome of the experimental results and figures are difficult to interpret, leading to confusion. There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the model's performance and the underlying reasons for its superior results. A more detailed study is necessary to clarify these points (please refer to the specific question below).\n3. **Technical Issues.**\nThe core of the proposed method is to constrain the action space to include only actions with a high probability of being sampled by a behavior cloning policy. However, it remains unclear how the method guarantees that policies with higher performance than those in the dataset can always be found. This raises concerns about the robustness of the approach."

                "value": "1. The PCA algorithm is mentioned in Section 5.3, but it is not explained or referenced earlier in the paper. Could you clarify what the PCA algorithm refers to in this context, and how it relates to the overall methodology?\n2. In Section 5.4, it is stated that \"the reinforcement learning complexity is reduced when the simulated performance is high.\" However, I observed that the baseline performance is also quite high. Could you provide further explanation on how we should interpret Figure 2 and the relationship between simulated performance and RL complexity in this context?\n3. In the experiments within Section 5.2, your method significantly exceeds the upper bound you set for the Walker2d-Medium-Replay dataset. Given that the action space is constrained, this result seems theoretically unlikely. Could you clarify how your method achieves such results, and whether this outcome is consistent with the constraints imposed by your approach?\n4. In Section 4, it appears that Algorithm 3 does not directly address a hard constraint problem during the reinforcement learning process. Instead, it seems to perform a data processing step directly on the dataset. Could you explain how this aligns with or addresses the hard constraints mentioned earlier in the method description?"

                "value": "1. The authors should expand the related work section, as recent key studies on both online and offline PbRL, as well as RLHF for LLMs, are currently missing.\n\n2. Especially, DPPO [1] is a two-step algorithm for offline PbRL that learns a preference predictor followed by direct policy learning through a newly proposed preference score based on policy-segment distance, thereby avoiding reward learning and RL. Additionally, CPL [2] directly learns a policy without both reward modeling and RL. Both approaches address the same challenges as this paper, indicating that this is not the first study to tackle these issues.\n\n3. I am concerned that with unbounded regularization, as mentioned in line 240, optimization might become unstable. Additionally, could excessive conservatism risk resulting in a policy that is unable to achieve high rewards?\n\n4. Further discussion on function $f$ and $\\mathcal{P}^\\prime$ are necessary to improve clarity and avoid confusion.\n\n5. I recommend including training and evaluation configurations, such as hyperparameters for each method and details on the evaluation process (e.g., number of runs over random seeds), in the appendix for reproducibility.\n\n6. The paper lacks quantitative results for experiments on pessimism effectiveness. Additionally, if these results are based on a single run, I suggest conducting multiple runs and illustrating the findings. This suggestion applies to all the experiments in section 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.\n\n7. Several SOTA baselines in offline PbRL, such as PT [3], DPPO [1], and CPL [2], are missing from the evaluation.\n\n8.

The modification over conventional offline PbRL is very slignt and lacks considerations. Merely restricting the action space based on the offline dataset could introduce several issues, such as limiting the policy\u2019s ability to explore alternative, potentially optimal actions. This paper does not account for the potential negative consequences of such a simplistic restriction, which may lead to unintended limitations in policy performance and adaptability.\n2. The paper lacks a clear structure, with an excessive focus on background information and well-known techniques. The authors should place greater emphasis on detailing their own methods, providing both theoretical insights and empirical analysis to strengthen the contribution of their approach.\n3. The experiments are not convincing and comprehensive, as the authors compare their method only to basic baselines in a limited set of simple environments. Additionally, the presentation of the results is unclear. For example, the authors show the performance of the best policy learned by a method during training, which is actually improper. In Table 1, certain values are bolded without explanation. Moreover, the final scores should be reported using normalized rewards rather than raw sums to enable more meaningful comparisons. Furthermore, Figures 1, 2, and 3 lack consistency in their x-axis labeling, making cross-comparisons difficult. Consolidating the results for each task into a single figure and displaying all methods would improve clarity and readability.\n4. Overall, this paper does not meet the standards expected for this conference. Significant improvements are needed in both the methodology and experimental evaluation to adequately address the mentioned challenges in offline PbRL."

Why do the authors evaluate the performance of the learned policies on the learned reward models instead of ground-truth reward models? Why does the simulated performance go down in the rightmost subfigure in Figure 2?
