    "abstract": "We introduce RNA-FrameFlow, the first generative model for de novo 3D RNA backbone design. We build upon $SE(3)$ flow matching for protein backbone generation and establish protocols for data preparation and evaluation to address unique challenges posed by RNA modeling. We formulate RNA structures as a set of rigid-body frames and associated loss functions which account for larger, more conformationally flexible RNA backbones (13 atoms per nucleotide) vs. proteins (4 atoms per residue). Toward tackling the lack of diversity in 3D RNA datasets, we explore training with structural clustering and cropping augmentations. Additionally, we define a suite of evaluation metrics to measure whether the generated RNA structures are globally self-consistent (via inverse folding followed by forward folding) and locally recover RNA-specific structural descriptors. The most performant version of RNA-FrameFlow generates locally realistic RNA backbones of 40-150 nucleotides, over 40\\% of which pass our validity criteria as measured by a self-consistency TM-score $\\geq0.45$, at which two RNAs have the same global fold.",

While clustering and cropping augmentations aim to mitigate this, they lead to a decrease in sample validity. Additionally, over-represented lengths like those common to tRNA and 5S rRNA may cause the model to rely on memorized structural features, limiting its novelty in unseen scenarios.\n\n2. The evaluation pipeline uses RhoFold for forward folding, but RhoFold\u2019s length bias favors structures with specific lengths, potentially skewing evaluations for other sequence lengths. The reliance on scTM and pdbTM as primary evaluation metrics may thus disproportionately favor over-represented sequence lengths, and alternative, less biased evaluation methods could improve fairness."

                "value": "Main Weaknesses:\n\n1. The innovation in the methodology section is limited. It applies frame flow to the backbone design of RNA. However, the application of frame flow to RNA design, in my view, lacks novelty, as frame flow is a model for generating frames (although the authors only provide experiments with proteins), and RoseTTAFoldNA has already offered a method to represent RNA as frames. Therefore, applying frame flow to RNA seems like a combination and does not appear to be a significant enough contribution to serve as the primary innovative point for a top-tier conference paper; it could only be considered a minor innovation and a baseline. However, this paper presents it as the main innovation. I think this paper needs to highlight some other insights, such as what problems arise when applying frame flow to RNA and how they should be addressed. The paper does indeed point out some insights, like how to address the issue of insufficient data and how to represent RNA as frames. However, I have questions about these insights. First, the lack of 3D structural data for RNA is a well-known problem [1], and it is not an insight. To solve this problem, the authors propose data augmentation methods, such as Structural clustering and Cropping augmentation. But these Structural clustering[3] and Cropping augmentation[2] are very common [2,3] and cannot be considered major insights or innovations.\n\n[1] RDESIGN: HIERARCHICAL DATA-EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR TERTIARY STRUCTURE-BASED RNA DESIGN\n\n[2] AlphaFold3 & AlphaFold2\n\n[3] SE(3) diffusion model with application to protein backbone generation\n\n2. Another innovation in the methodological part is their proposal of a way to characterize RNA backbones as frames. However, I find this questionable. First, in RoseTTAFoldNA, a method to characterize RNA backbones as frames has already been proposed, and it is highly similar to the one presented in this paper. Therefore, this paper is not the first to propose such a method. Second, while RoseTTAFoldNA constructs frames based on the phosphate group (P, OP1, and OP2), this paper bases its construction on C3\u2032\u2212C4\u2032\u2212O4\u2032. However, the authors do not provide compelling reasons or experimental results to demonstrate that choosing C3\u2032\u2212C4\u2032\u2212O4\u2032 is a superior option. The authors do mention in the paper that C3\u2032\u2212C4\u2032\u2212O4\u2032 is more centrally located. Nevertheless, even so, I do not think this would lead to a significant improvement in model performance, as it essentially just adds a fixed offset to the RNA, and neural networks should be capable of fitting this offset. Thus, I do not consider this a valid innovation. If, however, the authors can provide experimental results showing that using C3\u2032\u2212C4\u2032\u2212O4\u2032 over P, OP1, and OP2 significantly enhances the model's performance, along with a compelling analysis of the underlying reasons, I would be willing to regard this as a major innovation.\n\n\nMinor Weaknesses:\nTo my knowledge, the reliability of RNA structure prediction results is not as high as that of protein structure predictions. As a result, although the experimental outcomes have some reference value, they are not very precise. Of course, I understand this is a difficult issue to resolve, and my evaluation of this paper does not hinge on this point. This issue has a minimal impact on my rating of the paper, and the authors can disregard it. I am merely pointing out this objective fact in the interest of rigor. It would be better if the authors could provide additional experimental data, such as some molecular dynamics software that can now estimate RNA energy, which would also serve as a helpful evaluation tool."
