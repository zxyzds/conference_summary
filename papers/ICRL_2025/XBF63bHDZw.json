    "title": "SimulPL: Aligning Human Preferences in Simultaneous Machine Translation",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates translations while receiving streaming source inputs. This requires the SiMT model to learn a read/write policy, deciding when to translate and when to wait for more source input. Numerous linguistic studies indicate that audiences in SiMT scenarios have distinct preferences, such as accurate translations, simpler syntax, and no unnecessary latency. Aligning SiMT models with these human preferences is crucial to improve their performances. However, this issue still remains unexplored. Additionally, preference optimization for SiMT task is also challenging. Existing methods focus solely on optimizing the generated responses, ignoring human preferences related to latency and the optimization of read/write policy during the preference optimization phase. To address these challenges, we propose Simultaneous Preference Learning (SimulPL), a preference learning framework tailored for the SiMT task. In the SimulPL framework, we categorize SiMT human preferences into five aspects: **translation quality preference**, **monotonicity preference**, **key point preference**, **simplicity preference**, and **latency preference**. By leveraging the first four preferences, we construct human preference prompts to efficiently guide GPT-4/4o in generating preference data for the SiMT task. In the preference optimization phase, SimulPL integrates **latency preference** into the optimization objective and enables SiMT models to improve the read/write policy, thereby aligning with human preferences more effectively. Experimental results indicate that SimulPL exhibits better alignment with human preferences across all latency levels in Zh$\\rightarrow$En, De$\\rightarrow$En and En$\\rightarrow$Zh SiMT tasks.",

While SiMT has been extensively studied in the research community, most papers have focused on automatic metrics rather than real human preferences. This work proposed 5 human preferences that are closely related to the end-users of SiMT.\n\n2. The proposed optimization objective aligns well with the proposed human preferences. For example, the output length constraint is applied for latency preference. The derived final objective in Eq(9) is further to improve its read/write policy."

Or this work is to GPT-4 preference alignment?  Figure 2 only shows the win-rate between GPT-4 translation and original one. Is there a comparison between GPT-4 and professional interpreter?\n\n2. In the experiments, you only tune the hyper-parameter $\\alpha$, and set $c_t$ as 0.5 to control the read/write. In general, tuning the thresholds of $c_t$ may introduce various read/write strategies. Did you try other threshold?"

                "value": "1. Since real-time translation is a key requirement of SiMT, LLM-based SiMT may need to re-translate each partial source sentence, as the decoder-only architecture of LLMs does not permit the insertion of additional source tokens without disrupting the positional indexes of the already translated target tokens. I want the authors to justify this issue.\n\n2. Continued on Weaknesses 1, given some GPT-4/4o translations, is that possible to ask the professional interpreter to select the high quality translation? Then a classifier or reward model can be implemented to filter out the translations align most with human."

Scope is very limited to SiMT only, and this method does not seem applicable to more general LLM preference alignment cases.\n4. Some design is arbitrary.

More experiments and analysis should be done to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. In the current form, experiment analysis are limited.\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] Park, Ryan, et al. \"Disentangling length from quality in direct preference optimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.19159 (2024)."

Could you imagine a speech-to-text scenario where you could offer multiple text windows so the user can look at one window when latency is a priority and another window when BLEU is a priority?"

They tell me what I need to know when I need to know it.  In addition, sometimes the speaker uses a metaphor that requires more explanation.    The professionals understand when then need to do more than just translate what the speaker said.\n\nI never liked average latency.  I can't fault you for doing what others have done, but sometimes latency matters and sometimes it doesn't.  The professionals understand this.  They speed up when necessary and slow down when latency is less of a priority.  Moreover, I probably care more about worst case latency or RMS latency than average latency.\n\nThis literature would benefit by including more input from professional interpreters that have a lot more experience in this area than we have.\n\nI would really like to see some data from schools that teach professional interpreters. We should be able to record what students say in the booth when they learn how to do this task."
