    "title": "LLMScan: Causal Scan for LLM Misbehavior Detection",
    "abstract": "Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.",

The authors provide detailed visualizations and analysis showing how different patterns in the causal maps correspond to different types of misbehavior, as demonstrated in Figures 2-5 and the extensive experimental results in Section 4.\n3. The method shows impressive performance, particularly for detecting lies, jailbreaks, and toxic content, with AUC scores consistently above 0.95 across different models and datasets. This is particularly notable given that the method works with the first generated token, allowing for early detection of potential misbehavior."

                "value": "Cons:\n1. The performance on bias detection is notably weaker than other tasks, with AUC scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.78. While the authors acknowledge this limitation and provide some analysis in Section 4.3, they could have explored more deeply why their approach struggles with this particular type of misbehavior and potential solutions.\n2. While the authors provide a public code repository, the reproducibility section (Appendix C) could be more detailed, particularly regarding the specific hyperparameters used for the detector training and the process for selecting attention heads for token-level analysis.\n3. The evaluated LLMs are relatively limited and small-scale. It is suggested that the authors also evaluate on models with a larger scale such as llama-70B. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the proposed method is relatively limited."

E.g.,  \n    - The name of causality seems misleading. The process described in ``Computing the causal effects of tokens'' is a measurement of sensitivity to token replacement by the attention scores. Since the target is an internal attention score, the term causality seems not to be an appropriate description. \n    - The term causal map is also weird. The causal map provides a vector value and not a 2-dimensional matrix value. \n- Besides the example of {\u201cWho developed Windows 95?\u201d. The truthful response is \u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u201d. The untruthful response is \u201cBill Gates\u201d} (Line 263) is also very curious since Bill Gates is the CEO of Microsoft Corporation at that time.\n- Other typo/errors: \n     - Table 2 duplicate first and second row"

LLMScan is composed of two key components: a scanner and a detector. The scanner assesses the influence of each token through attention scores and evaluates the contribution of each layer by examining differences in output logits. These token influences and layer contributions are used to form a causal map and serve as features, which are then processed by a multi-layer perceptron (the detector) to identify misbehavior in the LLM. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMScan by detecting four types of misbehavior across 13 public datasets using three well-known LLMs."

Here are some reasons: \n\n- In the context of causal inference, when we conduct the intervention on a token, we should expect the downstream effects on the intervention, leading to the change of other tokens. That said, this paper implicitly makes a strong assumption that all tokens are independent of each other. However, this assumption may not be held in NLP.\n\n- From the perspective of estimating causal effect, the method only measures a difference in attention scores given a single instance, which is actually more like deriving a counterfactual sample if we assume tokens are independent. \n\nNote that I was not questioning the effectiveness of this method. I just don't think the technique described constitutes a rigorous causal analysis. The proposed approach provides useful insights, but labeling it as causal analysis without following the established principles can be misleading."
