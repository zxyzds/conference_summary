    "title": "Deep Signature: Characterization of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.",

                "value": "The paper introduces Deep Signature, a framework for characterizing dynamics on graphs. Deep Signature involves three key components: (1) graph coarsening using a deep spectral clustering module, (2) computation of path signatures to capture global inter-node interactions using iterated integrals over time, and (3) a two-layer MLP for property prediction.\nThe authors tested Deep Signature on three datasets: (1) gene expression dynamics, classifying into degradation or dimerization types, (2) GPCR dynamics, distinguishing between active and inactive states, and (3) EGFR mutant dynamics, predicting drug sensitivity. They conducted an ablation study validating the contribution of each loss component in the model and performed limited comparisons with methods based on static structures, dihedral angles, and GraphLSTM."

In particular, the invariance to time reparameterization is key because the underlying MD simulations might be prone to random restarts and miscellaneous artefacts preventing them from being a smooth \"video\" (ie, the MD itself might be erratic with the same state sampled repeatedly).\n\n2. Deep Signature _learns_ the ideal CG beads relevant to the task, bypassing the need to manually remove degrees of freedom (eg: CA-level coarse-graining, as done in existing methods). The use of the signature transform allows for local and global temporal interactions to be captured well, as opposed to learning representations on separate frames. \n\n3. I'm confident this method can be used for good representation learning of trajectory information for tasks beyond the ones mentioned in the paper (eg: interpolation in the latent space of protein conformations, perhaps for ensemble generation).\n\n4. Demonstrates relatively good performance compared to weak and strong temporal graph learning baselines (like GraphLSTM)."

                "value": "The paper does not clarify the level of coarsening necessary to make path signature computations feasible. For instance, in gene regulatory dynamics, the graph was reduced from 100 nodes to 30, while the EGFR dataset was reduced from approximately 5000 atoms to 50 nodes, but the level of coarsening for the GPCR dataset is unspecified. This raises questions about whether 50 nodes is a computational limit for the method. Additionally, while protein structure can be intuitively coarsened into backbones, sidechains, and motifs, the interpretation for coarsened graphs in gene expression dynamics is unclear. It is uncertain if the coarsened nodes correspond to gene hubs or other biologically meaningful groupings.\n\nThe equation used to model GRN dynamics (Eqn 13 in Section B.1) appears incorrect. Specifically, for dimerization (when f=2), the concentration should should be squared under Michaelis-Menten kinetics, rather than simply doubling the decay rate. This could lead to inaccurate modeling of gene expression dynamics and affect the results in this section.\n\nThe comparisons used in the experiments are limited and static, primarily involving the first and last frames (head, tail, and head & tail) which do not capture temporal dynamics. The authors do not benchmark against dynamic approaches that consider time-varying information, such as MDTraj [1], Timewarp [2], and DSR [3]. Including these comparisons would provide a more rigorous evaluation of Deep Signature's effectiveness relative to established tools for molecular trajectory analysis.\n\nThe authors claim that the coarsened dynamics in Fig 6c follow the same trend as the original dynamics, yet this similarity is not quantified. Providing a quantitative measure, such as correlation coefficients between the original and coarsened dynamics at various coarsening levels, would better support this claim. Additionally, the paper would benefit from comparisons of the authors' coarsening strategy against other deterministic and learnable methods for protein graph coarsening to demonstrate its effectiveness and fidelity in preserving dynamics.\n\nThe description of the cross-validation process and test set creation is confusing. The authors mention \u201cfor each running, we evaluate the prediction accuracy of our method on an independent unseen test set and report the averaged results,\u201d but it is not clear how this set is constructed. If results are averaged, please report the standard deviation in all the tables.\n[1] MDTraj: A Modern Open Library for the Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories.

Existing equivariant neural networks with geometric inductive biases have been outperformed, both in terms of performance and efficiency, by Transformer-style architectures (ie, something as simple as torch.nn.TransformerEncoder). Was any ablation done that compares Deep Signature with such architectures that \"tokenize\" the trajectory intervals?   \n\n2. I'm curious what the learned coarse-grained beads/maps look like for GPCR proteins \u2013 is it creating CG beads only based on atoms within a locality? How does this compare to naively taking atoms within some radial ball and considering them a bead? More often than not, these naive CG choices work well in practice, without the need to overcomplicate it with a learnable method. I'd like to see whether this \"learned GCN-based coarse-graining\" is really necessary.\n\n3. How sensitive is the path signature transform to very dynamic conformational changes in a short duration of time? For instance, as I mentioned above, fast-folding proteins undergo significant changes in 3D shape in just short simulations. Can this method capture this dynamics well enough?"
