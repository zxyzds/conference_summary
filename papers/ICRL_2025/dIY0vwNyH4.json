    "title": "Understanding, Abstracting and Checking: Evoking Complicated Multimodal Reasoning in LMMs",
    "abstract": "The recent large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated their impressive capability of image understanding. However, they still struggle to make complicated reasoning for solving a challenging multimodal problem. In this paper, we present UnAC (Understanding, Abstracting, and Checking), a novel multimodal prompting method, to synergize reasoning for complicated problems in the multimodal context of LMMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4V.  To improve the understanding of the image and capture more details, we propose an adaptive visual prompting method to make LMMs able to focus on certain regions. An image abstracting prompting is designed to effectively extract information from images. Further, we propose a gradual self-checking scheme for leading to better reasoning by checking each decomposed sub-question and its answer. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks -- MathVista, MM-Vet, and MMMU -- demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

How does it correct the wrong answers? Figure. 2 did not clarify how this module works and lacked necessary information. It could be improved with some examples.\n- Line 352 indicated that UnAC introduced extra errors on the task of Mathematical reasoning, but there is no analysis of these errors. It would be better to report and analyse some failure cases.\n- Line 420 stated that UnAC can make the reasoning more stable under different values of temperatures. But in Figure. 4, there is no comparison between models w and w/o UnAC. This statement is not supported by any experimental results in the manuscript.\n- Very rush writing. Line 263, 317 and 356 stated that more experiments and examples are **provided in the Appendix. However, there is no appendix in the PDF.**"

                "value": "- How is OCR specifically implemented in adaptive visual prompts? Does it just add extra boxes as markers for detected texts on the image (Line 429 to 431)? If so, why not utilize the detected texts with their locations as extra text prompts as in MathVista [1]?\n- The adaptive visual prompts module helps the model focus on objects with semantic meaning (Line 164), but it is not helpful for problems such as solving a geometry problem or understanding a function plot (Line 431). But in Table 4, the improvements of adopting adaptive visual prompts on figure question answering (FQA), textbook question answering (TQA) and visual question answering (VQA) are quite different. FQA and TQA mainly focus on solving and understanding geometry/chart/function problems, and the improvements are relatively high (5.7% and 4.1%). In contrast, on VQA , which mainly focuses on understanding objects with semantic meaning, the improvements are limited (1.3%). These experimental results are against the aforementioned statements, what is the reason?"
