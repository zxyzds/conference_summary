    "title": "Learning a Compact, Parcel-independent Representation of the fMRI Functional Connectivity",
    "abstract": "Functional connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is often calculated at the level of area parcels. Given the data's low-dimensional nature, we posit a substantial degree of redundancy in these representations. Moreover, establishing correspondence across different individuals poses a significant challenge. We hypothesize that it is possible to learn a compact representation of the functional connectivity data to enhance computational efficiency without losing the essential structure of the original data. Furthermore, comparable functional connectivity across individuals with differing area parcel definitions would be more straightforward when projected to a common low-dimensional latent space. Our analysis, based on various performance benchmarks, indicates that the low-dimensional latent space learned from the functional connectivity of one dataset generalizes well to another dataset. Notably, the latent space learned using a variational autoencoder represents the data more effectively than linear methods at lower dimensions. However, at higher dimensions, the differences between linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods diminish, rendering them comparable to the parcel representation with 333 dimensions. Our findings highlight the potential of employing an established transformation to obtain a low-dimensional latent representation in future functional connectivity research, thereby promoting reproducibility and supporting open science objectives.",

                "value": "Hi for your concern about dual submission and overlap with the Kim et al. paper, please see my responses below. I will reply to other concerns separately in a different comment (not sure if this is the right way to do it but it's the first time I'm submitting to a conference on OpenReview and I'm still learning).\n\n1. The Kim et al. paper used fMRI time series data (temporal), and the current work uses the connectivity seed maps (spatial, correlation of time series) which tend to be \"trait-like\" fingerprints for subjects (one summary metric per session) and are much more commonly associated with traits/phenotype etc. unlike fMRI time series data. In addition, their training data and testing data were from the same dataset, and we want to demonstrate that the projections learned from one dataset (be it linear or nonlinear) could generate meaningful embeddings in a completely different dataset with very different acquisition protocols. Therefore, like atlases/parcellations, we could use a generic projection (whether it is linear or nonlinear) to obtain insights for/store new data instead of having a different embedding for each dataset (e.g. Margulies et al. 2016 PNAS and other fMRI dimensionality reduction). It was my original plan to further extend and demonstrate this in developmental datasets but I felt that would not fit in the limited pages in the paper.\n\n2. We did adapt the figure from Kim et al. 2021 because we used the model architecture from the publically available code from Kim et al. 2021 https://github.com/libilab/rsfMRI-VAE as we stated in the methods. Because it seems like a generic model description and I could not find a good way to modify it while still retaining the meaning, I modified the figure. Is it possible for me to note \"adapted from consent from Kim et al. 2021\" to avoid plagiarism? Or is there any suggestion on how I could modify the figure but retain the meaning?"

The results in this study are quite convincing, and the method seems sound given its simplicity. The authors take pains to provide sufficient details for replicability in terms of model architecture and optimization, and a significant amount of work is included in the appendix which elaborates on the results and justifies hyper-parameter discussions. \n\nI want to take the simplicity of this approach as a strength rather than a weakness as well. I find that simple approaches are refreshing and if they outperform state of the art, should be widely adopted. That said, as I elaborate on in the weaknesses section, convolutional VAEs are a fairly old model and comparisons ought to be made with more novel methods such as Transformer-based architectures (such as Brain LM [1] perhaps), or generative adversarial networks (GANs) [2]. That said, the model convincingly outperforms the linear methods used as baselines in this work.\n\n[1] Ortega Caro, Josue, et al. \"BrainLM: A foundation model for brain activity recordings.\" bioRxiv (2023): 2023-09.\n\n[2] Goodfellow, Ian, et al. \"Generative adversarial networks.\" Communications of the ACM 63.11 (2020): 139-144."

                "value": "While the simplicity of the model could be a strength, more work is needed to justify why a convolutional VAE would outperform other nonlinear reconstruction methods which exist in the literature. The most obvious omission is that the authors ought to compare against a traditional convolutional auto-encoder in order to justify why the variational model should be used in favor of a non-variational approach. As I've mentioned above, more novel reconstruction methods such as GANs and Transformer-based architecture ought also to be considered. The performance above linear reconstruction methods is convincing; however, multiple nonlinear reconstruction methods exist and have been applied to functional connectivity before [3,4,5]. This omission by itself puts this below the acceptance threshold for me, and unless the authors can provide a substantial rebuttal which includes comparisons, I would encourage them to resubmit this work at a later date given more substantive comparisons to modern architectures.\n\nFurthermore, it seems the authors have not performed any cross-validation or multiple model training (across different random initializations) in order to reduce the variance from individual runs of the model. It is standard practice to perform a k-fold cross validation and provide error bars across folds in order to assure that model improvements do not amount to a particularly good subset of data or model initialization. This omission is more glaring than the previous one and puts it below a marginal reject to a full reject for me. If the authors can provide k-fold cross validation results in their revision, I will consider improving my score to a marginal reject; however, I think this work would benefit from a substantial revision and resubmission at a later date.\n\nFinally, I think this work would benefit from training on a larger cohort of data, such as the UKBiobank [6] which contains several thousand participants. This alone does not lower the score for me; however, I will point out that the data sets in this study are quite small and finding a larger cohort of data would substantially improve the results here. \n\n[3] Zhang, Lu, Li Wang, and Dajiang Zhu. \"Recovering brain structural connectivity from functional connectivity via multi-gcn based generative adversarial network.\" Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention\u2013MICCAI 2020: 23rd International Conference, Lima, Peru, October 4\u20138, 2020, Proceedings, Part VII 23.

I.e. a poor model focusing on noisy signals may have high subject consistency as noise/bias may be subject specific, produce high degree of homogeneity and lend itself well reconstructed as such noise confounders may be prominent as fMRI generally suffers from poor SNRs. As such, the methodology is not compared to ground truth information of neuroscientific interest such as recovery of task responses in task data, ability to predict properties of the individuals such as age, gender and cognitive capabilities etc (and why I deem the results qualitative). Such data is available from the HCP cohort and would strengthen the study to include and see what has been learned in regards to neuro- and cognitive-science relevant aspects.\n\nThe results are not so convincing. It seems simple methods such as ICA and PCA when applied with larger dimensions provide better reconstruction quality than the beta-VAE as indicated by the results of Figure 3. I find this somewhat surprising as I would expect the beta-VAE to be able through its non-linear modeling to efficiently compress the signal characteristics of the seed maps. This would be good to further elaborate upon as it then becomes unclear why to use advanced modeling approaches as opposed to very simple procedures such as ICA and PCA.\n\nI understand that given the metrics and the uniqueness of considering seed-derived maps there are no natural alternative modeling procedures to consider. However, I would have liked to see conventional PCA and ICA compression on the time series and their reconstructions of seeds to further understand if this type of information cannot already be reproduced in such conventional neuroimaging analyses. \n\nAlso, I think the paper would substantially improve to consider prediction of external information such as demography and cognitive abilities available in the HCP cohort to ground the methodology\u2019s utility more quantitatively in terms of such ground truth information available for the individuals. It would in this context also be possible to understand and compare the proposed seed-based beta-VAE compressions utility when compared to standard neuroimaging compression methodologies operating directly on the spatio-temporal data for which there is a large literature using various approaches to predict aspects of the individuals of neuroscientific interest."

However, standard parcellations only use a couple hundred nodes, and datasets have around a hundred subjects. I am not convinced by their argument that computational complexity is a significant problem at this scale. After all, they cite a community detection algorithm which works on graphs over 1000x larger (Soman and Narang, 2011). While their method indeed is lower dimensional than parcellations with hundreds of areas, I would want to see complexity or runtime analysis if they claim that their method offers significant computational savings. \n\nMinor presentation comments on Figure 3:\n- I think the colormap for correlations is a bit unclear since some similar colors are in fact far away from each other (e.g. light/dark blue, yellow and light green). I suggest considering alternative \"diverging\" color maps.\n- Given that there isn't much discussion of matching subjects across method, I suggest not using line plots in panels B-D and instead using a Strip plot, or box-and-whisker plots, or bar plots.
