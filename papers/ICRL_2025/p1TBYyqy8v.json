    "abstract": "Node-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on graphs has received significant attention from the machine learning community. However, previous approaches are evaluated using unrealistic benchmarks that consider only randomly selected OOD nodes, failing to reflect the interactions among nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new challenging task to model the interactions of OOD nodes in a graph, termed spreading OOD detection, where a newly emerged OOD node spreads its property to neighboring nodes. We curate realistic benchmarks by employing the epidemic spreading models that simulate the spreading of OOD nodes on the graph. We also showcase a ``Spreading COVID-19\" dataset to demonstrate the applicability of spreading OOD detection in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to effectively detect spreading OOD samples under the proposed benchmark setup, we present a new approach called energy distribution-based detector (EDBD), which includes a novel energy-aggregation scheme. EDBD is designed to mitigate undesired mixing of OOD scores between in-distribution (ID) and OOD nodes. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in both spreading OOD detection and conventional node-level OOD detection tasks across seven benchmark datasets.",

                "value": "Q1: Since the dataset is central to the benchmark, it is crucial to understand how well it reflects realistic contact-driven networks for virus spreading. Information on whether the dataset\u2019s assumptions have been validated against more realistic epidemic scenarios would also help clarify its suitability for simulating disease dynamics. Could the authors provide detailed information on the construction and structure of the LastFM dataset, including the main mechanisms of edge formation, the presence of high-degree nodes that could act as super-spreaders, and the dataset\u2019s time span in relation to episode durations required to reach 75% node infection? \n\nQ2: Could the authors discuss the sensitivity of the proposed method to variations in the SIS model parameters and its adaptability to different diffusion patterns? Understanding this sensitivity is important for evaluating the method\u2019s robustness in various scenarios. Additionally, could the authors clarify why OOD detection is not approached as a binary classification between ID and OOD, or as a one-class classification in cases where only ID labels are available? Addressing these points would provide valuable insights into the generalizability of the benchmark and the chosen approach for OOD detection.\n\nQ3: Given the high error bars in Tables 2 and 3, how conclusive are the results? Could the authors explain if the similar performance of EDBD and the Energy method suggests that data features, rather than graph structure, drive the performance? Also, since Eq. 4 of the paper is quite similar to Eq. 7 of GNNSAFE, could the authors clarify the exact differences between EDBD and GNNSAFE beyond adding the energy similarity and consistency matrices? For example, does the first row in Table 4 represent GNNSAFE?\n\nQ4: Since hyperparameter tuning can greatly impact performance, could the authors explain how it was done for both EDBD and baseline methods? Was the search for competitors restricted compared to EDBD? For GNNSAFE, was only the supervised loss used, or did the authors include GNNSAFE++ with energy regularization? If only the supervised loss was used, what motivated this choice?"
