    "title": "Can foundation models actively gather information in interactive environments to test hypotheses?",
    "abstract": "While problem solving is a standard evaluation task for foundation models, a crucial component of problem solving---actively and strategically gathering information to test hypotheses---has not been closely investigated. To assess the information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive environments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the factors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its previously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to maximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a text-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables high-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which requires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to real-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as self-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering efficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single rewarding feature, we find that Gemini's information gathering capability is close to optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding features, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's effectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self correction into the model improves performance.",

                "value": "The paper aims to assess the ability of foundation models to gather more information to finish a task/achieve a goal in interactive environments, with simple and complex reward functions.\n\nIn order to do so, the authors build a text-based and an embodied 3D environment where the goal is to find properties/concepts of objects (shape, color, etc.) which lead to maximum reward, without any prior information. The 3D environment only has visual cues, and thus provides a harder problem to solve. In 3D environment, Gemini only provides textual instructions to a human, who then performs it in the environment.\n\nThe agents are evaluated based on their efficiency (number of steps) required to gather the information needed to solve the problem, and their accuracy (how often the correct property is identified given fixed budget of steps).\n\nThe authors evaluate variants of Gemini model (Flash, 1.5 Pro) against random baselines (with and without replacement), and optimal baselines (a rule-based agent that optimizes for information gain). The task complexity varies in number of features in combination (single feature vs conjuction) that are to be identified as rewarding.\n\nThe learning/inference is designed as a two-stage process - vision and reasoning - where Gemini first lists down all the previous placements, timestamps, and rewards, and then tries to pick next action accordingly.\n\nThey show that Gemini models perform better than random baselines, and that total number of steps needed to find optimal properties increases with complexity.\n\nThey also experiment with self-correction, long-context windows and guided reasoning show that self-correction is more effective in complex conjunction tasks. The long-context window leads to improvement in conjunction tasks too. They also find that removing cases with visual errors leads to significant improvement in the 3D environment setting."

Curious to hear an explanation on why this was done. What about the results on other LLM families?\n- The results in Figure 3 are not unexpected. I would expect a larger LLM to be more efficient on account of more training/generalization ability, and LLMs to be worse than optimal baseline and better than random agents. I think there should be some more exploration towards finding new/unexpected insights or maybe a deeper analysis of the results.\n- The environments are simple and the approach is not easily extensible to more real-world scenarios. I think disentanglement of the exploration component is important, however there should also be some thoughts on how to disentangle this component in more realistic tasks like navigation/more complex search-based problems, etc. Even the 3D environment has limited shapes/colors and limited number of correct objects.\n- The downstream use-cases/impact of this work is not discussed, and is not immediately clear from the reading.\n- Guided reasoning is not described in the main paper, but discussed. It also seems to achieve the best results in Fig 4 b. \n- For the 3D environment, a human performs the instructions specified by Gemini. Can there ever be cases where Gemini instructions are vague? If not, there needs to be some discussion (if only a few lines) on this.\n\t- What kind of expertise does it need from the humans?\n- \"A likely reason for this is that the iterative nature ... occasional erros\" -  What happens when the two-stage process is removed and a single step process is used i.e. direct reasoning from the previous data?  This seems like an important ablation.\n- Minor:\n\t- Line 374: Guided reasoning is mentioned here, but not mentioned anywhere before.\n\t- Line 487: \"aren't\" -> are not."

As a benchmark, evaluating a wider range of models could provide a more comprehensive understanding. This constraint limits the applicability and generalization of the study's findings to other models. \n- From my point of view, the assessment of pure LLMs' strategic information-gathering abilities appears less meaningful (e.g., compared with RL agents) due to the agents' inability to engage directly in dialogue with the environment. This limitation hinders the ability to mimic human-like information-seeking behaviors through questioning and conversation. I think a more compelling focus could be evaluating agents powered by LLMs. While for agents, there are some pipelines designed for ensuring the information gathering in different environments. \n- The experimental setups appear somewhat overly simplistic, lacking the complexity needed to truly challenge the models' capabilities. The distinction between text-based and embodied environments appears unnecessary. Is the primary difference the visual input versus text input? Also, I think the research would benefit from incorporating a greater variety of examples (which somewhat related to real-world applications) or expanding its applications to demonstrate a broader utility and impact.\n- The paper may fall short in demonstrating substantial contributions, appearing to merely transpose traditional cognitive experiments to test large language models (LLMs) without significant innovation."
