    "title": "Spread them Apart: Towards Robust Watermarking of Generated Content",
    "abstract": "Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license.  In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.",

It would be insightful to understand the trade-offs here.\n\nA further concern is the scalability of the proposed approach. The watermark retrieval process requires comparing each image against every user's secret key before generating a binary string, which appears impractical as the user base grows. This limitation suggests that, as the number of users increases, the approach may face significant challenges in maintaining efficiency and scalability."

Such visual aids could convincingly illustrate the impact of these constrained attacks on image quality and watermark robustness.\n\n2. For the \"contrast -\" result in Table 2, it is 0.998. This value is influenced by a negative sign introduced during processing. Given that the method employs a two-tailed detection approach, this result is indeed the optimal outcome in this context. However, a brief explanatory note could help clarify this for readers, potentially reducing confusion about the significance of the negative sign and its impact on the results."

If the watermark doesn\u2019t successfully embed into the image, the latent $z$ is optimized, otherwise, the image is given to the user. To decide on the threshold, the method uses double-tail detector as described [1]. To embed the watermark, the method generate a unique secret $s(u_i)$ and a watermark $w(u_i)$, then embed it on the pixel level. If the embedding is not successful, the method further fine-tunes the latent vector $z$, with a two-component loss. The paper also provides a proof of robustness against additive attacks. The experiment shows that the method demonstrates strong robustness against various watermarking removal attacks, while still maintaining high image quality.\n\n\n[1] Zhengyuan Jiang, Jinghuai Zhang, and Neil Zhenqiang Gong. 2023.

It seems all models that have a decoder structure can perform this method, which is pretty general, like VAE or GAN.
