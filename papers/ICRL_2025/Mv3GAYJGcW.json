    "title": "MetaDesigner: Advancing Artistic Typography through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis",
    "abstract": "MetaDesigner revolutionizes artistic typography synthesis by leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive a design paradigm centered around user engagement. At the core of this framework lies a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline, Glyph, and Texture agents, which collectively enable the creation of customized WordArt, ranging from semantic enhancements to the imposition of complex textures. MetaDesigner incorporates a comprehensive feedback mechanism that harnesses insights from multimodal models and user evaluations to refine and enhance the design process iteratively. Through this feedback loop, the system adeptly tunes hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences, generating WordArt that not only meets but exceeds user expectations of visual appeal and contextual relevance. Empirical validations highlight MetaDesigner's capability to effectively serve diverse WordArt applications, consistently producing aesthetically appealing and context-sensitive results.",

Additionally, it demonstrates the effect of merging LoRAs with varying weights.\n\n3. The paper utilizes advanced prompt-LM techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, and Feedback Refinement, to enhance the accuracy of sub-prompts for each agent, resulting in generated content that better aligns with user preferences."

The impact and novelty of other modules are also insufficiently highlighted. The paper adopts a style closer to a technical report.\n\n2. **Insufficient Experimental Design**: For example, (a) the user study includes only 11 participants, and it may benefit from a fair comparison using publicly available VLMs (e.g., GPT4-V); (b) the ablation study only analyzes the ToT module within the \u201cTexture Designer,\u201d without examining the analyses of other modules; (c) the comparison of generated results with other models is limited to 6 samples in Fig. 5, and more samples would be expected."

Would replacing the previous GPT-4 with GPT4-V be a more effective choice? Quantitative and sample-based analyses? b) What differences would arise if using GPT4-V instead of LLava in the \u201cFeedback\u201d stage?\n\n5. **Potential Common Problems in Generated Images**: a) Although the images in Fig. 5, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9 may possess artistic qualities, the text color often resembles the background, making it less distinguishable compared to results from other models.  b) In the lower-left of Fig. 8, style information, such as \u201cRenaissance,\u201d is generated as part of the text\u2014what causes this, and is this phenomenon common?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Some technical details are missing. For example, in \u201cNormal & Traditional Glyph\u201d, the rendering details of normal and traditional glyphs based on $s^{gly}$ are unclear. Also, it is not clear how vector graphics optimization in \u201cSemantic Glyph Transformation\u201d is done. Where do the \u201ctarget objects\u201d come from and what is the loss function exactly? In Section 3.4, what is the meaning of $L_m$ and $L_u$ ?\n\n2. Some experimental settings are questionable. First, comparison to SDXL is unfair. Traditional text-to-image models like SDXL often require detailed prompts and may not work well with brief instructions (e.g., \u201cCreate a stylish word World Peace representing its meaning\u201d) that the proposed system is supposed to handle. The proposed system utilizes GPT for input prompt extension and, thus, it should be compared against a GPT-augmented SDXL where GPT is used to extend the input prompt into a more detailed description relevant for text generation.  Second, in the user study, \u201cAesthetics & Creativity\u201d should be divided into two independent dimensions, instead of being merged as a single one. Third, the claim \u201cTable 2 presents quantitative results using SSIM and LPIPS metrics, further reaffirming the excellence of our approach in terms of readability and aesthetics.\u201d is inadequate. SSIM and LPIPS mainly measure image similarity and, therefore, are not suitable for evaluating readability. To compute quantitative scores for readability and legibility, a more reasonable way may be to apply a model to detect and recognize text on the generated images and then compare the outputs with the ground truth text. Last, the \u201cquantitative\u201d evaluation of the Q&A evaluation agent is lacking. The results of the proposed method, without this agent, should be added to Table 1 and Table 2. \n\n3. Some results are not satisfactory. As shown in Figure 5, the outputs by the proposed method, although being visually appealing, suffer from low text legibility and readability: some letters and words are either hard to recognize due to some of their strokes being excessively deformed or stylized (e.g., as leaves), or hard to read because of low color contrast between them and the background."

                "value": "1. Should Equation (13) use max instead of argmax?\n\n2. For the hyperparameter optimization in Section 3.4, it seems that the parameters are updated with GPT (as illustrated in Figure 4). What are the detailed prompts used to instruct GPT to output the updated prompts/parameters for each case in Figure 4?\n\n3. For the user study, what does \u201cText accuracy\u201d mean? Was the input text exposed to the participants during the study? What is the meaning of the percentages in Table 1?"
