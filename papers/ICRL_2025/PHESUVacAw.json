    "abstract": "Single-cell omics technologies capture molecular snapshots of cells, while most\nbiological processes unfold over time. Accurately predicting single-cell gene ex-\npression at unmeasured time points enhances our understanding of these processes,\nreducing costs and experimental effort by enabling the interpolation and extrap-\nolation of observed data. This helps study continuous development, response to\nperturbations, and disease progression. To address this problem, we propose an\nencoder-decoder transformer architecture for Temporal Reconstruction of Cellular\nEvents (TRACE). TRACE models gene expression generation as a sequence-to-\nsequence generation task by learning to transform a sequence of genes from a\nsource condition (e.g., previous time) into a sequence of genes in a target condition\n(e.g., next time point). TRACE decoder learns to generate gene tokens of the target\ncondition by iteratively unmaking tokens in the target sequence, overcoming the dis-\ncordance between autoregressive modeling and the non-sequential nature of gene\nexpression data. We evaluate TRACE both quantitatively and qualitatively on three\ndatasets, covering a range of tasks and biological scenarios. TRACE outperforms\nexisting models in generalizing across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks\nfor temporal prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the biological relevance of\nthe cell embeddings learned by TRACE by delineating activation-dependent cell\nstages in immune cells, measured across multiple time points. Our findings suggest\nthat TRACE can enhance in silico hypothesis generation, improving our under-\nstanding and prediction of cellular changes over time. This ultimately facilitates\ndisease understanding and supports the design of cost-effective experiments for\nbiological discovery.",

Single-cell gene expression data collected at various time points provides an avenue to unravel these processes. However, collecting this data at many different time points is expensive. To help alleviate this problem, the authors develop a seq2seq model called TRACE. TRACE follows recent work such as Geneformer to encode a cell\u2019s expression profile at any given time point as a sequence of gene tokens. Then, it uses an encoder-decoder architecture to predict the gene tokens at a target time point given the gene tokens at either previous time points (extrapolation) or surrounding time points (interpolation). The authors show that TRACE outperforms existing methods for predicting expression profiles at unseen time points."

Its main innovation is the usage of seq2seq modeling for directly capturing gene-gene interactions across time points instead of relying on cell embeddings as intermediates like in existing methods. Related work has been adequately cited and the authors state how TRACE improves upon existing methods.\n- **Quality:** The authors benchmark TRACE against relevant baselines on three different datasets and show that it outperforms them for interpolation and extrapolation. However, their other analyses lack a compelling rationale in my opinion.\n- **Clarity:** In the introduction and related work sections, the authors clearly articulate the motivation for interpolating and extrapolating temporal data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). They also describe how seq2seq modeling can enhance temporal reconstruction. However, the remaining sections lack clarity and do not provide sufficient information to comprehend the specifics of the task and the methodology employed. In my opinion, the manuscript requires substantial revision for acceptance.\n- **Significance:** TRACE outperforms existing methods for temporal reconstruction. However, due to issues with the clarity of the manuscript, it would be difficult for other researchers to understand and build upon this work. While the primary results comparing TRACE to baseline methods are compelling, the supporting results lack convincing evidence and do not align with the narrative."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Beginning with the Methods section, the clarity of this paper needs to be significantly improved for acceptance. Additionally, some of the analyses presented in the paper lack a clear motivation. Below are my suggestions for each section:\n\n- **Methods:**\n   - Although the general problem is stated in the introduction, a more detailed description is required. The current problem description lacks clarity and specificity. It fails to provide precise details about the inputs and expected outputs for interpolation and extrapolation, leaving the reader to make assumptions. It might be useful to illustrate the problem using one of the datasets used for evaluation.\n   - The description of the training process is unclear and disjointed. The authors should provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide outlining the training methodology. Providing an algorithm that describes the process would be useful.\n   - It is also unclear how TRACE is utilized for inference. The concise descriptions in lines 237-241 are not particularly informative. Both interpolation and extrapolation appear to be performed in the same manner. Furthermore, it is unclear how the sequence length and number of time points can be adjusted, as they should be constants for a given dataset. Again, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide a succinct algorithm outlining the inference process for both interpolation and extrapolation.\n\n- **Experiments:**\n   - The metrics employed in this work should be meticulously described to ensure that individuals unfamiliar with the specific metrics utilized in prior work can comprehensively understand them.\n   - In my opinion, the analysis presented in section 4.5 does not align with the overall narrative of the text. It fails to provide any insights into the temporal reconstruction capabilities of TRACE.\n\n- **Ablation:** I find the analyses in this section very uninformative and it is unclear why these specific ablations were performed. It would be beneficial if authors could explain for why these ablations are probing the most critical aspects of their method. In my opinion, a more insightful ablation could be conducted on the training data used for interpolation/extrapolation. For instance, it would be interesting to explore how performance is affected by excluding data points that are closest to unseen time points."

            "questions": {
                "value": "In addition to the suggestions above, I have the following questions:\n\n- Why is $t_0$ data exclusively utilized for computing source embeddings? How is data from other time points incorporated into the training process?\n- Why are only the source embeddings computed using the encoder? Why are the other embeddings computed using a frozen TRACE decoder?\n- Do the encoder and decoder use the same gene token embeddings?\n- It is unclear how the $Y_i$s are computed, are they computed using the decoder\u2019s gene token embeddings?\n- It also unclear what the $C_t$s represent, are they the gene embeddings for time $t$, the [CLS] token embeddings, or some combination/function of both?\n- One of the main motivations for this work is to directly learn gene-gene interactions between time points to predict expression profiles at unseen time points. Although the seq2seq model accomplishes this objective to a certain extent, all final gene counts are still predicted using the cell embedding. Wouldn\u2019t it be more effective to directly use the gene embeddings to make predictions instead of using the cell embedding?\n- How are the two losses ($\\ell_{SSL}$ and $\\ell_{ZINB}$) combined during training?\n- How exactly are the positional encodings for time computed?

Due to the non-autoregressive nature of single-cell data, TRACE employs an iterative unmasking generation style rather than the traditional autoregressive generation common in transformers.

It handles high-dimensional single-cell data without dimensionality reduction.\n   2. It provides a learned embedding space for transformation between token and gene expression spaces.\n   3. It integrates well with foundation model pretraining and offers scalability.\n   4. It avoids challenges like posterior collapse often seen in VAE training.\n  5.
