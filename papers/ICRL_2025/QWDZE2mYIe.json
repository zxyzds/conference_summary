    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic audio, posing significant challenges in voice authentication, media verification, and fraud detection. While deep learning models are frequently used for fake audio detection, they often struggle to generalize to unseen and complex manipulations, particularly partial fake audio, where real and synthetic segments are seamlessly combined. This paper explores the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for fake and partial fake audio detection, an area that has not yet been investigated. SNNs, known for their energy-efficient computation and ability to process temporal data, offer a promising alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). We propose an SNN-based approach for fake audio detection and comprehensively evaluate its performance through a series of experiments, including hyperparameter tuning, cross-dataset generalization and partial fake audio detection. \nOur results show that SNNs achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art ANN models with fewer number of parameters. Although, SNNs did not offer significant improvements in generalization capabilities, they provided advantages such as reduced model sizes and computational efficiency, making them more suitable for resource-constrained and real-time voice authentication applications.\nThis study lays the groundwork for further exploration of SNNs in audio spoofing countermeasures, providing a foundation for future advancements in security-critical voice applications.",

The author proposes in the contribution that \"combining real and synthetic samples from the Fake or Real dataset, Demonstrating the effectiveness of SNNs in detecting partial fake audio at the frame level, \"but no specific experimental data or demonstration examples were provided for the detection effect at the frame level. It is recommended that the author further improve this section.\n2. The author points out in the introduction the limitations of existing ANN models in generalization and processing complex forged audio, but lacks data support or experimental evidence for the specific manifestations of these limitations. Suggest citing specific literature or experimental data to quantify the shortcomings of existing methods in detecting counterfeit audio.\n3. The model proposed in the paper contains multiple key modules, but the role of these modules is not fully emphasized in the overall framework diagram or textual description. It is suggested that the author highlight the core role of each module in the methodology section to highlight the logical structure of the model and deepen readers' understanding of its working mechanism.\n4. The author designed multiple experimental plans, but the organization of experimental design and results is somewhat scattered. To enhance logical coherence, suggest clearly separating the objectives, methods, and results of each experiment into sections.\n5. The experimental results presented in Table 2, especially the EER index, perform worse than the existing methods, which the authors must explain in the paper."

                "value": "1. The related work mentioned in this paper may not fully represent the current research status, as deep fake audio detection has been a long-standing and ongoing research direction. As stated in Section 1, \"the detection of partially fake audio\u2014where real and synthetic audio segments are seamlessly merged\u2014remains an underexplored area\", which may not be accurate. For example, research on identifying or localizing fake segments within a piece of audio can be considered as detecting partially fake audio, according to the taxonomy of this work. The following literature from 2022 to 2024 provides just a few examples that are not included in this paper:\n - Yadav, Amit Kumar Singh, et al. \"Mdrt: Multi-domain synthetic speech localization.\" ICASSP 2024-2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2024.\n - Xie, Yuankun, et al. \"An Efficient Temporary Deepfake Location Approach Based Embeddings for Partially Spoofed Audio Detection.\" ICASSP 2024-2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2024.\n - Zhang, Lin, et al. \"Range-Based Equal Error Rate for Spoof Localization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.17739 (2023).\n - Khan, Awais, and Khalid Mahmood Malik. \"Securing voice biometrics: One-shot learning approach for audio deepfake detection.\" 2023 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS). IEEE, 2023.\n\n2. The motivation for introducing SNNs for detecting fake audio could have been more convincingly stated. For example, does the architecture of SNNs make them particularly suitable for this task? According to Section 1, \"SNNs are inherently designed to process temporal data due to their ability to capture the timing and sequence of events, which makes them particularly suitable for tasks involving audio, which has rich temporal dynamics.\" However, the experimental results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that SNNs actually perform worse than the self-implemented CNN in most cases. Additionally, from an efficiency perspective, do SNNs offer other benefits beyond having fewer parameters that make them more suitable for practical use? If so, in what scenarios do existing continuous-parameterized neural networks fail to meet the detection latency requirements?\n\n3. Since the reviewed related work is limited, this may also make the evaluation less comprehensive and representative. For example, as stated in Section 4.2, \"Due to the lack of cross-dataset evaluation studies on assessing the generalization ability of ANNs for the fake audio detection problem...\", this statement may not fully consider the necessity of cross-dataset generalization performance evaluation for existing deep neural network-based fake audio detectors. If the evaluation is limited to simple ANN architectures, such as feed-forward and convolutional architectures, then the considered evaluation scope could have been significantly expanded."

While these are important datasets for this field, other available datasets, such as WaveFake [4] and In-the-Wild [5], would enhance the study\u2019s scope by testing the model\u2019s generalization across a broader array of synthetic audio sources, further verifying its performance on diverse data.\n\n- **Lack of Robustness Evaluation**: The study does not explore the robustness of the SNN and CSNN models under common real-world audio perturbations, such as MP3 compression or Gaussian noise. Evaluating the models with these types of perturbations would provide a more practical understanding of their performance and adaptability in noisy or degraded audio environments.\n\n### References\n1.
