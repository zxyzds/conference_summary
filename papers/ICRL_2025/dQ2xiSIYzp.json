    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the task of learning 3D human Gaussians from a single image, focusing on recovering detailed appearance and geometry including unobserved regions. We introduce a single-view generalizable Human Gaussian Model (HGM), which employs a novel generate-then-refine pipeline with the guidance from human body prior and diffusion prior. Our approach uses a ControlNet to refine rendered back-view images from coarse predicted human Gaussians, then uses the refined image along with the input image to reconstruct refined human Gaussians. To mitigate the potential generation of unrealistic human poses and shapes, we incorporate human priors from the SMPL-X model as a dual branch, propagating image features from the SMPL-X volume to the image Gaussians using sparse convolution and attention mechanisms. Given that the initial SMPL-X estimation might be inaccurate, we gradually refine it with our HGM model. We validate our approach on several publicly available datasets. Our method surpasses previous methods in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction. Our approach also exhibits strong generalization for cross-dataset evaluation and in-the-wild images.",

Besides feature from image space like the splatter image paper, this HGM model additionally aligns features based on the fitted SMPL-X template via a dual path. Then, the SMPL-X parameters and GS prediction are iteratively refined to improve mutual alignment. Finally, a ControlNet model generates a back view, which, combined with the front view, is processed by a two-view HGM for the final reconstruction."

SMPL-X Refinement Concerns: Although justified in ablation studies, the proposed iterative SMPL-X refinement is a EM-like approach, while the previous works always refine SMPL parameters regarding the original input image. The proposed iterative refinement may depend heavily on initial GS and SMPL-X accuracy, making it sensitive and prone to degenerate solutions. Also, the wording in Section 3.3.2 is a bit redundant and would benefit from refinement for clarity and conciseness."

To resolve this issue, this paper introduces generate-then-refine pipeline that 1) reconstructs 3D Gaussians, 2) refines SMPL-X & back-view, and 3) reruns the 3D Gaussian reconstruction. The experiments demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art in novel-view synthesis and 3D reconstruction compared to existing methods."

I think solving the proposed generate-then-refine pipeline could be one of the good research directions in 3D human reconstruction. The proposed approach sounds plausible, and can be plugged into most reconstruction algorithms. The paper is written in an easy-to-understand manner."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have several concern points below.\n\n1) About SMPL-X refinement strategy\n\nIt is unclear why the proposed SMPL-X refinement pipeline actually helps. As described in Section 3.3.2, the SMPL-X is optimized by two-type losses: normal loss and rendering loss. The optimization targets of two losses can be inaccurate: normal GT is from normal estimator, rendering T is from coarse Gaussians. Furthermore, as the coarse Gaussians are processed based on the initial SMPL-X (Figure 2), it seems that coarse Gaussians will not deviate much from the initial SMPL-X. It is questionable whether the proposed SMPL-X improvements always guarantee improved reconstruction quality. For example, if using a distinguished SMPL-X estimator, the refinement pipeline can lead to performance degradation.\n\n2) Validation of SMPL-X refinement\n\nAlthough SMPL-X refinement is claimed to be an important contribution, there is no detailed experiment on it. Although Table 4 indirectly demonstrates this, more explicit experiments on SMPL-X improvements (measuring MPJPE for before refine. / after refine.) are required.  Additionally, to strengthen the effect of SMPL-X refinement, experiments on diverse SMPL-X initial estimator [1,2,3] are also needed.\n\n\n3) Description about ControlNet in back-view refinement\n\nThe paper does not specified how ControlNet in back-view refinement is trained. Back-view refinement is also a major contribution of this paper, so it is important to clarify the training procedure for the reproducibility. I would recommend describing ControlNet's architecture, learning strategy, and training dataset. Specifically, I curious about how to augment coarse image (ControlNet condition) for the training. Furthermore, I also recommend that conducting a quantitative comparison with SiTH's back-view estimation (Figure 4) to justify the proposed refinement module.\n\n4) Writing\n\na. In Section 3.3.2, it is unclear whether SMPL-X only optimizes parameters or whether SMPL-X and HGM are jointly optimized.\n\nb. In L123, it is an overclaim that using multi-view images is main strength over existing methods. This algorithm setup using 12 rendered multi-view images (L350) is not significantly different from that using a 3D scan. Fundamentally, this algorithm also used 3D scans (L349), and did not show results when trained with 12 multi-view images for the existing methods.\n\n\n\n[1] Moon et al., Accurate 3D Hand Pose Estimation for Whole-Body 3D Human Mesh Estimation, CVPRW 2022.\n\n[2] Lin et al., One-stage 3d whole-body mesh recovery with component aware transformer, CVPR 2023.\n\n[3] Zhang et al., PyMAF-X: Towards well-aligned full-body model regression from monocular images., IEEE 2023.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed approach looks plausible and well-designed, but I am concerned that the proposed generate-then-refine strategy is actually effective. I think it could be a good academic paper if it includes a more clear explanation about SMPL-X refinement (1, 2) and back-view refinement (3), which are the core of the generate-then-refine strategy."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1) According to the paper, it looks like back-view refinement is quite effective. If back-view refinement improves the final Gaussians, can the improved Gaussian be a good source for back-view refinement? In other words, I wonder if performance can continue to improve if processes 2) and 3) in Figure 2 are performed cyclically. This experiment would be a good way to demonstrate how much the paper's approach improves reconstruction performance."
