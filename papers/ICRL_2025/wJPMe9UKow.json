    "title": "Posterior Label Smoothing for Node Classification",
    "abstract": "Soft labels can improve the generalization of a neural network classifier in many domains, such as image classification. Despite its success, the current literature has overlooked the efficiency of label smoothing in node classification with graph-structured data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective label smoothing for the transductive node classification task. We design the soft label to encapsulate the local context of the target node through the neighborhood label distribution. We apply the smoothing method for seven baseline models to show its effectiveness. The label smoothing methods improve the classification accuracy in 10 node classification datasets in most cases. In the following analysis, we find that incorporating global label statistics in posterior computation is the key to the success of label smoothing. Further investigation reveals that the soft labels mitigate overfitting during training, leading to better generalization performance.

The contribution of this paper is somewhat incremental - the idea of using neighborhood information to perform label smoothing has already been extensively studied [1, 2]. \n\n2. \"Under the assumption that the neighborhood labels are conditionally independent given the label of the node to be relabeled...\", I fail to comprehend this statement, hope authors can further explain this. But in any case, I think the assumption of two adjacent nodes are conditioally independent is too strong. \n\n3. While the proposed method shows superior emprical performance, this paper fail to provide an in-depth explaination on why label-smoothing performs so well in graph-structured data - does it stems from the same reason as i.i.d. data? What makes the proposed method superior than other label smoothing methods on graph?\n\n4. The improvements over the most competitive baselines are marginal - for most cases the differences are within the standard deviation.\n\n[1] Adaptive Label Smoothing To Regularize Large-Scale Graph Training, Zhou et al., 2021.\n\n[2] Structure-Aware Label Smoothing for Graph Neural Networks, Wang et al., 2021."

While the posterior label smoothing method achieves notable improvements on graph-structured data, it relies on the neighborhood label distribution of nodes, which may lead to unstable posterior distributions in sparse graphs or scenarios with very few labels, resulting in reduced label quality. Although the authors propose a strategy of re-estimating the posterior with pseudo labels, limitations remain, especially on heterogeneous graphs with sparse labels.\n2. Although the paper mentions that the computational complexity is linearly related to the number of edges and categories, it lacks sufficient discussion on efficient computation and optimization for large-scale graph structures, especially heterogeneous graphs. In real-world applications, such as large-scale social networks or e-commerce recommendation systems, this method may encounter efficiency bottlenecks.\n3. Although the paper compares various existing label smoothing methods, it lacks adequate comparison with the latest graph classification models, particularly on large-scale heterogeneous graphs. This limitation suggests that PosteL\u2019s effectiveness on more complex or dynamic graph tasks may require further validation."

After claiming the effective handling of heterophilic graphs as a highlight, the description of the proposed method fails to emphasize its treatment of heterophilic graphs. For instance, it is not clear why the proposed method is suitable for handling heterophilic graphs and where the efficiency of this treatment is manifested.\n\n2. The motivation for proposing the method and the effects achieved by the method itself seem to be contradictory. In Section 1, the authors state \"...their performance on heterophilic graphs, where nodes tend to connect with others that are dissimilar or belong to different classes, still remains questionable.\" However, the proposed method estimates the posterior of one node based on label frequency of its neighbours, which leads to its prediction similar to the classes of its neighbours. In addition, the estimation of the prior mitigates the problem of class imbalance but does not address the stated problem of heterogeneity.\n\n3. The idea in the method section of the article is similar to that of a naive Bayes approach, but some assumptions of conditional independence need to be clearly stated in Section 3.\n\n4. In the case where the neighbors are not labeled and the neighbors of the neighbors are also not labeled, an iterative process of generating pseudo-labels needs to be reflected in this algorithm part."
