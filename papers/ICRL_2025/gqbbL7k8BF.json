    "title": "A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization",
    "abstract": "Testing conditional independence (CI) has many important applications, such as Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Although several approaches have been developed for learning CI structures for observed variables, those existing methods generally fail to work when the variables of interest can not be directly observed and only discretized values of those variables are available. For example, if $X_1$, $\\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are the observed variables, where $\\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of the latent variable $X_2$, applying the existing methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ would lead to a false conclusion about the underlying CI of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$.\nMotivated by this, we propose a CI test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of discretization. To achieve this, a bridge equation and nodewise regression are used to recover the precision coefficients reflecting the conditional dependence of the latent continuous variables under the nonparanormal model. An appropriate test statistic has been proposed, and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of CI has been derived.\nTheoretical analysis, along with empirical validation on various datasets, rigorously demonstrates the effectiveness of our testing methods.",

Specifically, the last term should be $f'(\\theta_*)$  for a $\\theta_*$ between $\\theta_0$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$ rather than $f'(\\theta_0)$.\n\nThe empirical results are limited for showing the generality of the developed method for non-gaussian settings."

The following provides some details:\n\na) The authors were careful and patient in explaining detailed notations up to line 190. However, after that, the pace and notational complexity suddenly got of hand. For example, in line 192, the notation 1{ } is not even defined, let alone the meaning of the equation (the sentence in line 194 does not help). It was as if this part of the paper was written by a different author. I had a hard time understanding the paper from this point.\n\nb) Definition 3.1. What is \u201cthe estimated boundary\u201d? It should be rigorously defined somewhere. If the intention of this definition is to define \u201cthe estimated boundary\u201d then the language is not appropriate. It should be something like this: \u201cthe \\emph{estimated boundary of variables $X_j$ is defined as \u2026.\u201d. Currently, it reads as the estimated boundary is already defined before. \n\nc) Definition 3.4. Isn\u2019t this simply the formula for the sample covariance? that is Cov(X,Y) = 1/n \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_iY_i) - \\mu_X\\mu_Y? If so, what\u2019s the point of giving it a separate definition and name (bridge equation)?\n\nd) Theorem 3.5. I am confused by what is the rigorous statement in this theorem? By \u201cthis statistic is approximated to follow a normal distribution\u201d, do the authors mean that the statistic converges to a normal distribution as N grows? \n\ne) Theorem 3.9. Where is the \\hat{\\beta}_{jk} formally defined? I suppose the answer is not eq 13 as then it should have been out of the theorem. \n\nf) The Experiment Section is back on track and written clearly. It was unclear though why the addition of W at line 450 is good for assessing the power. \n\n2) One of the main motivations of this work was its application in Bayesian network (BN) structure learning. Nevertheless, insufficient effort was put into it. As the authors stated, the experiments in Section 4.2 are only for [extremely] sparse DAGs. They do consider denser ones in C2, but that is an only minor improvement, as the number of edges increased from p-1 to at most p+6. True DAGs can be much denser. The authors should provide a fair comparison for this part (also not to move these important parts in the appendix). \n\na) I suggest to test several established datasets in BN structure learning such as ASIA, CHILD, WATER, and ANDES. \n\nb) Similar to the other experiment section, here, non-Gaussian distributions should be tested for structure learning. \n\nc) Even if the results here are weak, DCT appears to be a promising method that is worthy of publication, provided a major rewriting. \n\nd) Note that without this structure learning application, this paper perhaps better suits a statistics journal.\n---\nOverall, a good problem is studied in this paper with a seemingly effective solution. However, the presentation of the technical parts needs a substantial improvement."
