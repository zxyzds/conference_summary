    "title": "PGLearn - An Open-Source Learning Toolkit for Optimal Power Flow",
    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging machine learning to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn implements realistic data generation procedures that capture both global and local variability, ensuring that datasets are representative of real-world conditions. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.",

                "value": "The authors proposed a library that generates datasets to standardize ML for OPF research. While each study in the literature shows improvement over earlier models, it is hard to fairly compare the model performance across different studies. \n\nThe authors proposed a library that constructs input output pairs to different formulations of the OPF problem (AC-OPF, DC-OPF and second order cone relaxation of AC-OPF) on large middle to large sized test cases. They also address data augmentation issues in the literature that results in a narrow demand range and implement a procedure that captures global larger demand characteristics. The library also contains solvers implemented in efficient libraries to find the corresponding optimal solutions and evaluation metrics to measure model accuracy and computational cost."

                "value": "1. A typical ML for OPF study goes through the steps of generation of input parameters (e.g. demand), finding corresponding solutions, model training and evaluation. The he authors contribute the literature with a toolkit that standardizes all these processes.\n2. I think main contribution of the study is that the proposed library improves  comparability and fair assessment of existing models. Many studies in the literature show improvement over some baselines but are not able to compare against the state of the art. The library enables researchers to compare their approaches with previously reported benchmarks without implementing each specific model.\n3. Another contribution is the data augmentation procedure that potentially generates different load characteristics.\n4. The library also implements widely solved formulations of OPF using efficiently written solvers."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. There are not many systems implemented in the library and most of them are large systems. Researchers may want to work on smaller systems for proof of concept or visualizing the model behaviour. It would be nice to add them.\n2. While the proposed data augmentation method generates wider range of demand dynamics than sampling random factor and multiplying the base load, I am not sure this approach captures the global dynamics. The demand characteristics can differ widely within the hours of a day or among different seasons, which can result in different constraints to bind at the solution. This is mentioned as a limitation, but I think more detailed demand scenarios should be considered to train more reliable NN models."

No algorithm insights nor new findings of learning to solve optimal power flow problems are reported.\n* Data augmentation is treated as the sole solution for tackling the non-standardized implementation problem for ML-OPF. Are there any other choices, such as sim-to-real transfer, multi-task or meta learning?\n* Though the paper claimed considering the correlation between samples, only uniform noises are added in a two-step approach. Uniform sampling is still far away from the real-world load data correlations. And the paper omits the discussion on how the proposed data augmentation approach resembles realistic settings.\n* The design of standard grid testbed models were rooted in abstraction and representation of real-world transmission grids. However, the paper falls short in explaining in details how the real-world data distribution can be applied to construct dataset for PGLearn.\n* In the demand sampling part, \" The power factor at each node is kept constant, i.e. the active and reactive power at each load is scaled by the same amount.\" This is not a very realistic setting, as power factor is having variations, and has a big impact on the OPF solutions.\n* There is no inclusion nor analysis of contingencies in OPF problems. Essentially the introduction mentions renewable uncertainties multiple times, while the proposed method does not address such uncertainty issues.\n* The PGLearn module is limited to implementations of few methods by similar group of authors. A more thorough literature review and inclusion of methods are recommended:\nZhang, Ling, Yize Chen, and Baosen Zhang. \"A convex neural network solver for DCOPF with generalization guarantees.\" IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems 9, no. 2 (2021): 719-730.\nZhou, Min, Minghua Chen, and Steven H.

But some more interactive representations shall be considered, e.g., generator/line value w.r.t capacity, prediction error, visualization of solution on grid, correlation between nodes and etc.\n\nSome minor issues and questions:\n* in Introduction, \"The increased volatility and scale of energy generation in modern and future grids...\" Shall be power generation in the scope of OPF. Similarly in the second paragraph: \" account for uncertainties in renewable energy generation and/or demand...\"\n* In Introduction, \"previously intractable applications such as real-time risk analysis\", yet in this work, there is no discussion on how ML can help with OPF risk.\n* \"inherent volatility of wind and solar generation creates OPF problems that are, or will be, orders of magnitude larger that today\u2019s instances.\" Why the increase of volatility will make the OPF instances larger? \n* The PGLib-OPF seems to be an important reference. Could the author explain more on \"PGLib-OPF only provides a single snapshot per grid\"? Does that mean only one data sample is provided for each power grid model?\n* In Appendix A.2.2, the authors mentioned the bus-pair variables were changed to branch on each variable. Could the authors explain more why this has marginal impact on the relaxation? And does this mean the ML model is learning the newly defined variables instead?"
