    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence techniques, transportation system optimization is evolving from traditional methods relying on expert experience to simulation and learning-based decision and optimization methods.\nLearning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators.\nHowever, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios.\nIn addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization.\nThe simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow.\nBesides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model.\nBased on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios including traffic signal control, dynamic lane assignment within junctions, tidal lane control, congestion pricing, road planning, e.t.c.\nWe choose five representative transportation system optimization scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities.\nThese experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization.\nThe anonymous code of the simulator is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/moss-AF45 and the others are shown at Appendix A.\nIn addition, we build an open-registration web platform to support no-code trials.",

They are therefore of equal importance and should be considered as a whole.\nAccording to the idea of the paper, GPUs are the hardware base for enabling computational acceleration, and the task of software system design is to best adapt to the hardware.\nWe identify two major difficulties (read/write conflict & vehicle sensing indexes) in the adaptation process and provide solutions (two-phase parallel process & linked-list based vehicle sensing indexes) that ultimately allow the GPU's performance to be fully utilized for acceleration.\n\n**To Question 1:**\nThe answer is YES.\nOur simulator supports user-configurable inputs of kinematic and IDM model parameters for each vehicle, including maximum acceleration, general acceleration, maximum braking acceleration, general braking acceleration, headway, and so on.\nUsers can build their own vehicle input data that they want to match the desired scenario, and we provide a tool chain (mosstool mentioned in Appendix A) to support such needs.\n\n**To Question 2:**\nIt is possible but not trivial.\nThe main obstacle is the knowledge of CUDA and the complicated build process of C++.\nActually, for an experienced developers, they can easily change the model by modifying the following function - `IDMCarFollowAcc(const Person& p, float target_speed, float ahead_speed, float distance, float headway)` (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/moss-AF45/src/entity/person/vehicle.cu: line 362) to do it.\nAttracting more community collaboration to improve the system was also one of our goals in opening the source code and submitting our work to ICLR."

For example, [1,3,4] are also a GPU simulators, are the techniques used for GPU acceleration in their papers the same as this paper?

However, this assertion could be problematic as vehicle interactions, particularly in congestion, often exhibit dependencies on nearby vehicles. The paper would benefit from a clearer explanation of how dependencies are managed in parallel to ensure realism without sacrificing computational performance. \n\n- In the Simulator Realism experiment, the paper mentions that the simulator achieves more realistic speeds compared to CityFlow. Given that CityFlowER now incorporates more realistic driving models, it would be valuable to benchmark the proposed simulator against it to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n- When demonstrating scalability at large vehicle counts, the reported performance of CBLab appears to contradict with its original paper when simulating scenarios with over 1,000 vehicles, with CityFlow performing comparably or even outperforming in such instances. This discrepancy between claims and results needs further explanation on why CBLab is generally worse than CityFlow - is this because of your data is different from the CBLab? Can you provide more details about their experimental setup, including the specific datasets used and any differences from the original CBLab experiments? If so, can you use the similar dataset used in CBLab?  It would also be helpful to request a detailed comparison of their experimental setup with that of the original CBLab paper, including specifics on hardware configurations and simulation parameters.\n\n-  The absence of scenario data within the provided code limits the reproducibility of results, particularly for scenarios such as traffic signal optimization and congestion pricing.

To overcome the computational limitations of existing simulators, the authors introduce GPU-based parallel processing, a two-phase parallel process, and a linked-list-based vehicle detection index. Through experiments simulating over 2.4 million vehicles, the proposed system achieved an approximately 88.92x performance improvement compared to existing systems. Furthermore, the authors present a framework that aims to integratively support five major traffic optimization scenarios: Traffic Signal Control, Dynamic Lane Assignment, Tidal Lane Control, Congestion Pricing, and Road Planning.\n\n- Soundness (Score: 2 - Fair): The design and performance improvement of the GPU-accelerated simulator proposed in this research are technically convincing, and the experimental methodology is systematic. However, the simplifications, such as excluding intersection interactions and various traffic participants (e.g., pedestrians, bicycles, public transport), may significantly affect the realism of the simulation, and these aspects were not clearly validated. It is unclear whether prior research justified these exclusions. Although extensive benchmarking experiments were conducted, the lack of detailed analysis and interpretation of the results leaves the motivations behind the scenarios insufficiently explained.\n\n\n- Presentation (Score: 3 - Good): The overall structure and explanations in the paper are clearly presented, particularly regarding system design and the use of GPU acceleration. However, the validation of each scenario within the same system is not clearly articulated. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a clear comparison of the proposed system architecture with existing studies, explaining the structural advancements and reasons for adopting this specific architecture.\n\n\n- Contribution (Score: 2 - Fair): The proposed performance improvements through GPU acceleration and the integrated traffic simulator framework are meaningful contributions to the field. However, the lack of individual effectiveness analysis for the five scenarios and insufficient validation of the simulator's realism are notable shortcomings. The experiments with real-world data are limited, which poses a constraint on the practical contribution aspect."
