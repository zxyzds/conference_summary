    "title": "On a Hidden Property in Computational Imaging",
    "abstract": "Computational imaging plays a vital role in various scientific and medical applications, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), Computed Tomography (CT), and Electromagnetic (EM) inversion. These methods address inverse problems by reconstructing physical properties (e.g., the acoustic velocity map in FWI) from measurement data (e.g., seismic waveform data in FWI), where both modalities are governed by complex mathematical equations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that despite their differing governing equations, three inverse problems\u2014FWI, CT, and EM inversion\u2014share a hidden property within their latent spaces. Specifically, using FWI as an example, we show that both modalities (the velocity map and seismic waveform data) follow the same set of one-way wave equations in the latent space, yet have distinct initial conditions that are linearly correlated. This suggests that after projection into the latent embedding space, the two modalities correspond to different solutions of the same equation, connected through their initial conditions. Our experiments confirm that this hidden property is consistent across all three imaging problems, providing a novel perspective for understanding these computational imaging tasks.",

                "value": "The paper considers three inverse problems (namely, FWI, CT reconstruction, and EM inversion). The authors propose a new architecture for the reconstruction operator by exploiting the relationship between the latent representation of the measured data and the parameters to be reconstructed.  In particular, the construction of the reconstruction net exploits the fact that the data and the parameters, in their latent space, are governed by the same wave equation with linearly correlated initial conditions. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the new architecture as compared with a couple of baseline methods for the three inverse problems mentioned above."

This also makes the overall presentation somewhat misleading and difficult to follow.\n\n2. The numerical experiments do not provide strong evidence in favor of the proposed method. The baseline methods for comparison (e.g., SIRT and InversionNet for CT) are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. State-of-the-art deep learning methods for CT (such as learned primal-dual by Adler and Oktem) are not used for comparison, making it difficult to judge the empirical superiority of the new architecture."

For instance, the word \u201cmodality\u201d is used to refer to the parameter and data spaces, which can lead to confusion. Some specific comments are below:\n\n- Abstract: \u201cwhere both modalities are governed by complex mathematical equations\u201d: This is a rather vague statement to use in the abstract. What specific governing equations are being referred to here? What latent space is talked about here? The actual contributions or the significance of the proposed method do not come out clearly from the abstract.  \n\n- Figure 1 caption (and other places in the introduction): The phrase \u201clatent space\u201d is used frequently without much explanation about what exactly it refers to. \n\n- Page 2: \u201cWhether an elegant mathematical relationship exists in the latent space, akin to that\nin the original space?\u201d: I don\u2019t think it is a precise, well-formulated research question. The mathematical relationship between the parameter space and the data space is determined by the specific imaging modality, whereas the relationship in the \u201clatent space\u201d is empirically enforced (and no such relationships are shown to exist theoretically). \n\n- Page 2: \u201c...typically with a bottleneck in the network, they lack a deeper understanding of these latent representations.\u201d: I don\u2019t see any such \u201cdeeper understanding\u201d (which in itself is somewhat vague and subjective) being uncovered in this paper either. \n\n- The phrase \u201ctarget property\u201d is used in several places in the paper. Could you please explain what this means?\n\n- Section 2.1: It might be good to make the descriptions of the inverse problems (FWI, CT, and EM inversion) more concise. \n\n- Page 6: \u201cDifference with vanilla FINOLA\u201d: This part needs to be rewritten. Currently, it gives the impression that the proposed method is capable of handling multi-modal data for reconstruction, which it isn\u2019t. \n\n- Page 7: Architecture details: Do you use the same architecture for the reconstruction network for all three inverse problems considered? \n\n- CT experiments: There is no comparison with the unrolling-based techniques (such as learned primal-dual), which are known to yield state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. The choice of the baseline techniques is somewhat arbitrary and not well-motivated."
