    "title": "FuzzyCLIP: Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompt in Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "How to enhance the alignment of text and image features in CLIP model is a key challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent studies mostly rely on precise category prompts for pre-training, but this approach is prone to overfitting, which limits the generalization ability of the mode. To address this issue, we propose the concept of fuzzy prompts and introduce Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) along with the Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module to improve the alignment between text and image features. This design significantly outperforms other methods in terms of training speed, stability, and final convergence results, showing remarkable efficiency in enhancing anomaly detection segmentation performance. What is even more surprising is that fuzzy stacked prompts exhibit strong generalization in classification tasks, enabling them to adapt to various anomaly classification tasks without any additional operations. Therefore, we further propose the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module, which leverages the strong generalization ability of fuzzy stacked prompts to regularize prompt learning, thereby improving performance in anomaly detection classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets, which demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.",

                "value": "1.Insufficient Innovation: While the paper introduces the concept of fuzzy prompts and a clustering-driven approach, the fundamental techniques used are extensions of existing methods in the field of vision-language models and prompt learning. The novelty might be seen as limited because it primarily combines known strategies in a new way rather than presenting a groundbreaking new algorithm or theoretical framework. This could lead to questions about the true advancement the paper offers to the field, beyond the specific application to zero-shot anomaly detection.\n\n2.Dependence on Dataset Characteristics: The effectiveness of the method seems to be highly dependent on the dataset's characteristics, particularly the clarity of internal clustering boundaries. For instance, the method performs better on the VisA dataset, where the clustering boundaries are clear, compared to the MVTec dataset, where it struggles to distinguish multiple clusters.\n\n3.Insufficient Experimental Evidence: The experimental results may not be sufficient to fully support all the claims made in the paper. Specifically, in two out of the five datasets, their method does not outperform AnomalyCLIP, which raises questions about the general applicability of their approach.\n\nMinor issues:\nAdditionally, the paper exhibits a lack of consistency in the referencing of figures and tables. While figures are abbreviated as \"Fig\", tables lack any abbreviation. Furthermore, the abbreviation for figures should be standardized to \"Fig.\" with a period, to adhere to conventional academic writing standards. Besides, futher descriptions for tables and figures should be added to the captions respectively."

Several aspects of Figures 1 and 2 are unclear:\n  - Figure 1: Please specify which method's training process generated the performance graphs in Figure 1 (a) and (b). Adding explicit labels or annotations indicating the methods shown, along with details on the experimental setup, would clarify the results presented.\n  - Figure 2: To improve clarity in Figure 2, consider adding labels or arrows to distinguish the inputs, operations, and outputs within the EFA module. Currently, the output seems to be multiplied by the features, yet this process is also labeled as EFA, which may be confusing.\n3. Additionally, the equations require clarification:\n  - In Equation 4, the method for finding the optimal class number K* seems to select a specific class K with the smallest distance difference, which could be misinterpreted as choosing a particular class k rather than determining the number of clusters k. Additionally, definitions for n, x, and x' are missing.\n4. Finally, there are some limitations regarding the effectiveness demonstrated in the experiments.\n  - For Tables 2 and 3, consider either using a consistent set of comparison methods across all datasets or explaining why different methods were chosen for each dataset. This would help readers interpret the results more accurately.\n\nFurther specific questions are provided in the Questions section."

Figure 4: Although the proposed methodology is described as clustering-driven, I noticed that only one cluster is formed in MVTecAD. This observation raises the question of whether clustering is meaningful in this context.\n3. Extending from Question 2: Table 5 suggests that the entire dataset can be represented by learning either the full dataset or specific clusters within an optimal number of \ud835\udc3e clusters. The authors argue that the expressiveness of individual clusters is demonstrated by comparing these two approaches. However, this claim seems limited without experiments on datasets with a large number of classes and clusters. It is unclear whether the high ZSAD performance results from the explanatory power of each cluster\u2019s data or merely from the strength of the pre-trained backbone, which may require minimal data for effective learning."
