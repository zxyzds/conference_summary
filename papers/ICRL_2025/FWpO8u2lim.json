    "title": "ClearSR: Latent Low-Resolution Image Embeddings Help Diffusion-Based Real-World Super Resolution Models See Clearer",
    "abstract": "We present ClearSR, a new method that can better take advantage of latent low-resolution image (LR) embeddings for diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR). Previous Real-ISR models mostly focus on how to activate more generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models to make the output high-resolution (HR) images look better. However, since these methods rely too much on the generative priors, the content of the output images is often inconsistent with the input LR ones. To mitigate the above issue, in this work, we explore using latent LR embeddings to constrain the control signals from ControlNet, and extract LR information at both detail and structure levels. We show that the proper use of latent LR embeddings can produce higher-quality control signals, which enables the super-resolution results to be more consistent with the LR image and leads to clearer visual results. In addition, we also show that latent LR embeddings can be used to control the inference stage, allowing for the improvement of fidelity and generation ability simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and generate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods. Our code will be made publicly available.",

The authors classify detail information as high-frequency information and structural information as low-frequency information. However, edges can also represent structure and are actually considered high-frequency information. The authors should use more appropriate terminology to avoid ambiguity.\n\nTo balance the fidelity and details of results, the author propose Latent Space Adjustment (LSA) strategy. However, the experimental results do not clearly demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in terms of fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc). In addition, similar approaches have also appeared in DiffBIR and PASD, and the author should provide a thorough comparison with the strategies proposed by these other methods."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The motivation is clear. However, there are some concerns regarding the proposed approach. Specifically, the LR latent embedding, which is the output of the VAE encoder, has a size of 4x64x64, while the input image is 3x512x512. Compared to the original image, the LR embedding loses a significant amount of spatial information. Therefore, the LR latent embedding may not be suitable for supplementing detail and structural information. \n\nFigure 2 shows that the proposed method has a low KL divergence value between the control signal and the low-resolution latent embedding. This suggests that the authors have introduced two modules to achieve a similar distribution between the LR latent embedding and the control signal. So why not use the LR latent embedding directly? Furthermore, from past work (DiffBIR, PASD, SeeSR), we know that the role of the control branch is primarily to remove degradation and bring it closer to the HR distribution. However, the method proposed by the authors results in the distribution of the control branch outputs being closer to the distribution of LR latent embedding, which is puzzling."

How to choose ideal hyperparameters can be tough and case-by-case. Moreover, when the degradation is severe, adding LR guidance into the inference may leads to blurry outputs. The authors should consider providing guidelines or heuristics for choosing hyperparameters, and discussing how their method performs under severe degradation conditions and the quality of the guidance under such cases.\n\n4. SUPIR has more powerful generative ability then the baselines in the paper. The authors may want to explain why SUPIR was not included as a baseline, or to consider adding it to their comparisons if feasible.\n\n5. Why choosing window cross-attention rather than full-attention and how to decide the window size? The authors should provide empirical or theoretical justification for using window cross-attention, and explain how they determined the optimal window size."
