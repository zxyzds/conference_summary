    "title": "Fair Submodular Cover",
    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasing prevalent in the modern world, and as a result there has been significant recent study into algorithmic fairness in order to minimize the possibility of unintentional bias or discrimination in these algorithms. Submodular optimization problems also arise in many machine learning applications, including those such as data summarization and clustering where fairness is an important concern. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Fair Submodular Cover Problem (FSC). Given a ground set $U$, a monotone submodular function $f:2^U\\to\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, and a threshold $\\tau$, the goal of FSC is to find a balanced subset of $U$ with minimum cardinality such that $f(S)\\ge\\tau$. We first introduce discrete algorithms for FSC that achieve a bicriteria approximation ratio of $(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}, 1-O(\\varepsilon))$. We then present a continuous algorithm that achieves a $(\\ln\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}, 1-O(\\varepsilon))$-bicriteria approximation ratio, which matches the best approximation guarantee of submodular cover without a fairness constraint. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with a number of empirical evaluations that demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms on instances of maximum coverage.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the fair submodular cover problem, where a submodular function is defined over a set of elements that are divided into disjoint classes. The objective is to select a minimum number of elements such that the selected subset meets a target submodular value threshold and the number of selected elements of each class is within a predefined interval.\n\nAlthough prior work has addressed fair submodular maximization, fair submodular cover has not been previously studied. The authors first provide a reduction from fair submodular maximization to fair submodular cover. It is worth noting that there was a reduction for the non-fair case, which does not directly apply here. Additionally, they develop new algorithms for fair submodular maximization, achieving improved results when applied within their reduction framework. For designing those algorithms, they leverage the result by El Halabi et al. (2020), which converts instances of fair submodular maximization into submodular maximization problems under matroid constraints."

All ground elements are partitioned into $N$ groups, each group $c$ having a corresponding interval $[p_c,q_c]$. The objective is to select as few elements as possible such that the value of the submodular function is greater than or equal to a given threshold $\\tau$, while ensuring that the proportion of selected elements from each group falls between $p_c$ and $q_c$.\n\nThe authors consider bicriteria approximation algorithms, where the threshold constraint may be violated by a factor. By establishing a relationship between fair submodular cover (FSC) and fair submodular maximization (FSM), they show that given a $(\\gamma,\\beta)$-approximation algorithm for FSM, they can convert it to an algorithm for FSC with an approximation ratio of $((1+\\alpha)\\beta, \\gamma)$. if the given FSM algorithm is continuous, they can yield an approximation ratio of $((1+\\alpha)\\beta, ((1-3\\epsilon)\\gamma-2\\epsilon)/(1+3\\epsilon +2\\epsilon/\\gamma))$. Furthermore, they present nearly feasible algorithms that can admit $((1+\\alpha)/\\epsilon, 1-O(\\epsilon))$-approximation and $((1+\\alpha)(\\ln(1/\\epsilon)+1), 1-O(\\epsilon))$. Finally, the proposed algorithms are investigated experimentally."

Next, they propose three algorithms for FSM that, when combined with their converting algorithms, produce approximate solutions for FSC. The discrete algorithms achieve approximation ratios of $(1 - O(\\varepsilon),\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ for FSM, while the continuous algorithm achieves a better ratio of $(1 - O(\\varepsilon),\\ln(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}) + 1)$ but needs more queries. By integrating these algorithms into their framework, they obtain improved FSC algorithms with better approximation ratios. The continuous algorithm for FSM with the converting algorithm achieves a $((1 + \\alpha) \\ln (n) + 1, 1 \u2212 7/n)$ bicriteria approximation guarantee for an instance of FSC when  $\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{n}$, which is close to the lower bound."
