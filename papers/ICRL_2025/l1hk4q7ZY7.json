    "title": "Relation Augmented Preferential Bayesian Optimization via Preference Propagation",
    "abstract": "In black-box optimization, when directly evaluating the function values of solutions is very costly or infeasible, access to the objective function is often limited to comparing pairs of solutions, which yields dueling black-box optimization. Dueling optimization is solely based on pairwise preferences, and thus notably reduces cost compared with function value based methods such as Bayesian optimization. However, an optimization performance gap obviously exists between dueling based and function value based methods. This is mainly due to that most existing dueling optimization methods do not make full use of the pairwise preferences collected. To fill this gap, this paper proposes relation augmented preferential Bayesian optimization (RAPBO) via preference propagation. By considering solution similarity, RAPBO aims to uncover the potential preferential relations between solutions within different preferences through the proposed preferential relation propagation technique. Specifically, RAPBO first clusters solutions using a Gaussian mixture model. After obtaining the solution set with the highest intra-cluster similarity, RAPBO utilizes a directed hypergraph to model the potential relations between solutions, thereby realizing relation augmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic functions and real-world tasks such as motion control and spacecraft trajectory optimization. The experimental results disclose the satisfactory accuracy of augmented preferences in RAPBO, and show the superiority of RAPBO compared with existing dueling optimization methods. Notably, it is verified that, under the same evaluation cost budget, RAPBO is competitive with or even surpass the function value based Bayesian optimization methods with respect to optimization performance.

                "value": "This work studied the dueling optimization problems under the framework of preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO). The key finding was that by leveraging directed hypergraphs to augment the relations among preference dataset, the optimization efficiency of (PBO) could be improved, and even competitive with the real-value-based Bayesian optimization method. Both synthetic functions and real-world tasks were considered to validate the effectiveness."

                "value": "1. The motivations may not be convincing. The dueling optimization problems were originally addressed by dueling bandits algorithms. In PBO, which considered continuous search space and the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the Gaussian processes (GPs) was introduced with kernels and priors that had already defined the relation among solution in the latent space. Therefore, in my opinion, what this work did is to supplement the characterization of correlation that has been quantified by priors and kernel functions. If so, I think a more elegent way is  to modify the format of kernel functions and strictly follow the Bayes rule, rather than performing preference propagation following by constructing two GPs in a single round, as presented from Line 167 to Line 170 in Algorithm 1, which not only increases computational complexity but also weakens the principle of the Bayesian optimization.\n3. The contributions, a.k.a. the introduction of GMM and directed hypergraph, were somewhat noval but not strong enough. No theoretical analysis nor design principles were used to underpin the rationality of the proposed algorithm.\n2. The experiment results are not satisfactory. The big variance implies that the proposed method may not statistically outperform other baselines in most cases. Methods such as Wilcoxon rank sum test could be used to demonstrate this point."

This paper uses the logistic assumption for the comparison outcomes. \n\nThe authors proposed a new algorithm relation augmented preferential Bayesian optimization (RAPBO) for dueling BO, and then make numerical experiments to compare the proposed algorithm with previous algorithms.

The PBO performance is naturally related to the clustering performance, since the assumption that similar solutions exhibit analogous relations holds only when exact clustering results is achieved.
