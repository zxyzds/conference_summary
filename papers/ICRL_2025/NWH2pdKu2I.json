    "title": "Prompt Distribution Matters: Tuning Visual Prompt Through Semantic Metric Guidance",
    "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has become a promising solution for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models on downstream vision tasks. VPT partially fine-tunes a set of learnable tokens while keeping the majority of the model parameters frozen. Recent research has explored modifying the connection structures of the prompts. However, the fundamental correlation and distribution between the prompts and image tokens remain unexplored. In this paper, we leverage \\textit{metric learning} techniques to investigate how the distribution of prompts affects fine-tuning and transfer learning performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, \\textbf{D}istribution \\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{V}isual \\textbf{P}rompt Tuning (DA-VPT), to guide the distributions of the prompts by learning the distance metric from their class-related semantic data. Our method demonstrates that the prompts can serve as an effective bridge to share semantic information between image patches and the class token. We extensively evaluated our approach on popular benchmarks in both recognition and segmentation tasks. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed method and offer a new direction for PEFT optimization in vision transformers. We demonstrate that our approach enables more effective and efficient fine-tuning of ViT models by leveraging semantic information to guide the learning of the prompts, leading to improved performance on various downstream vision tasks.",

                "value": "Dear Reviewers,\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your detailed and constructive feedback. Although we have decided to withdraw our submission, we greatly appreciate the opportunity to address your major concerns and clarify certain aspects of our work.\n\n1. Comparison with Wang et al. (2024):\nWe acknowledge that Wang et al.'s method, based on prompt initialization, reports performance comparable to ours. However, we did not include this work in our benchmarks for the following reasons:\n\n- Reproducibility concerns: The authors of Wang et al. recently removed their code repository, which included discussions about reproducibility issues raised by others.\n- Discrepancies in reproduced results: Even with their released code, our reproduction of their method still got results significantly below those reported in their paper.\n- Effect on our framework: In our revised experiments, we found that their proposed prompt initialization method does not positively impact our framework's performance.\n\n2. Key differences and advantages of our approach:\n\nOur method fundamentally differs from prompt initialization by dynamically optimizing the distribution of prompts throughout the fine-tuning process. This allows us to adaptively control class assignments, leading to more effective learning.\n\n3. Exploration of other metric learning losses and PEFT methods:\n\nWe carefully considered alternative metric learning losses (e.g., Proxy-NCA and Triplet Loss). However, these are less suitable for our framework due to the disparity between the number of visual prompts and data tokens. This imbalance often destabilizes training. In contrast, our use of the Proxy-Anchor loss explicitly accounts for the asymmetric nature of prompt-token relationships, ensuring stable optimization.\n\nLastly, we will address all other concerns raised in our next revision. Thank you once again for your valuable feedback, which will greatly inform the improvement of our work.\n\nSincerely,\nAuthors"

For instance, existing methods, like Time- [4], have achieved notable performance of 78.4 on VTAB, demonstrating the competitive landscape in this area. Given the abundance of related prompt research, this paper does not provide enough insights or robust experimental results to warrant a recommendation.\n\n[1].GLGait: A Global-Local Temporal Receptive Field Network for Gait Recognition in the Wild.\n[2].

This hypothesis should be verified either theoritically or empirically. \n\n- Metric learning tend to be sensitive for the hyper-parameter values.

Additionally, the proposed dynamic mapping method appears to share a similar technical approach with [a]. The authors should provide a comparative analysis to clarify these connections.\n\n2. After carefully checking the performance between DA-VPT and [a], it is observed that DA-VPT performs comparably to [a] when utilizing supervised-/MAE-/MoCov3-pre-trained ViT-B. For instance, DA-VPT achieves a mean accuracy of 83.20% on FGVC with the MAE pretrained ViT-B, while [a] achieves 83.26% under the same conditions. Given that DA-VPT is built upon [a], this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of the metric-based loss function. The authors should conduct ablation studies using [a] as the baseline to isolate the impact of prompt initialization and clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function, rather than using VPT as the baseline in Table 4.\n\n3. It remains unclear whether the metric-based loss genuinely enhances the similarity between prompt tokens and image tokens of the same class, especially since [a] achieves this solely through initialization, as evidenced by the increased mutual information.\n\n4. The manuscript lacks information regarding the number of prompt tokens and the hyper-parameters \\beta and \\alpha used across various datasets.  To improve reproducibility, the authors should provide a table to detailing the number of prompt tokens and hyper-parameters used for each dataset in the experiments.\n\n5. Figure 1 (b) is confused. I found a lot of little squares with different colors, but I didn't understand how these squares convey the flow of information. The authors should provide a more detailed caption or legend to clarify what each color represents and how the arrangement of squares relates to the information flow.\n\n[a] Revisiting the Power of Prompt for Visual Tuning.
