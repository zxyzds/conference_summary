    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of proteins, influenced by ligand interactions, is essential for comprehending protein function and progressing drug discovery. Traditional structure-based drug design (SBDD) approaches typically target binding sites with rigid structures, limiting their practical application in drug development. While molecular dynamics simulation can theoretically capture all the biologically relevant conformations, the transition rate is dictated by the intrinsic energy barrier between them, making the sampling process computationally expensive. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose to use generative modeling for SBDD considering conformational changes of protein pockets. We curate a dataset of apo and multiple holo states of protein-ligand complexes, simulated by molecular dynamics, and propose a full-atom flow model (and a stochastic version), named DynamicFlow, that learns to transform apo pockets and noisy ligands into holo pockets and corresponding 3D ligand molecules. Our method uncovers promising ligand molecules and corresponding holo conformations of pockets. Additionally, the resultant holo-like states provide superior inputs for traditional SBDD approaches, playing a significant role in practical drug discovery.",

From our point of view, a valid way to compare different settings for baselines and DYNAMICFLOW is to use MD trajectories-based methods, such as MMPBSA [5].\n- Moreover, the fact that a ligand binds well to a generated pocket may not imply that the real affinity is good. The validity of the generated pockets is not assessed.

The idea that the pocket changes upon the introduction of the ligand is well physically motivated. The generative model itself is impressive, as it combines various flow-matching modules.

However, questions remain regarding the quality of generated samples and the real-world applicability of the proposed methodology.\n\n*\\* The issues are sorted in the order they appeared in the manuscript.*\n\n**Issue 1: Bias in the training data.** Page 8. Section 4. Data curation.\n\nThis work relies on training datasets constructed from MD simulations, which may lead the model to learn the simulated physics of MD rather than capturing real-world structural distributions. While various 3D generative models ([1-2]) utilized simulation datasets (e.g., CrossDocked2020), I think it would be a minor issue. For future work, authors might consider leveraging true experimental datasets PDBbind [3] to enhance reliability [4].\n\n**Issue 2: Bias in the predicted pocket structure selection for analysis.** Page 9. Table 2, Page 10 Figure 6.\n\nIn the paper, authors selected the pocket structure (\"our pocket\") among the predicted pocket conformations based on Vina score, so the distribution of selected structures is biased from the training dataset. I suggest adding the analysis about randomly selected conformations, too. If the performance of SBDD methods (Table 2) or Volume distribution (Figure 6) are similar when using true holo structure and randomly selected structure, this would be strong evidence that the model has learned the distribution of holo structures.\n\n**Issue 3: Questions about applicability in real-world applications.** Page 16. Line 835. \"we locate residues within a cutoff distance of 7\u00c5 around each ligand and extract them from the 100-frame MD results.\"\n\nAs I understand it, this study define the pocket using the atom coordinate informations of known active binders in holo structures.\nHowever, I wonder whether these pocket definitions are directly applicable to Apo protein structures generated in AlphaFold.\nFor high usability, the pockets should be easily defined, e.g., defining pocket using the center and radius (or box length) in an Apo structure.\nThis process has been used in existing 3D generative models [1-2], but this is because they do not account for the flexibility of the pockets.\nIf I misunderstood the process, let me know.\n\n\n---\n**Reference.**\n1.
