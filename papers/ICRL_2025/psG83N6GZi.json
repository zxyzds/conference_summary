    "title": "Grassmannian Geometry Meets Dynamic Mode Decomposition in DMD-GEN: A New Metric for Mode Collapse in Time Series Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) often fail to capture the full diversity of their training data, leading to mode collapse. While this issue is well-explored in image generation, it remains underinvestigated for time series data. We introduce a new definition of mode collapse specific to time series and propose a novel metric, DMD-GEN, to quantify its severity. Our metric utilizes Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven technique for identifying coherent spatiotemporal patterns, and employs Optimal Transport between DMD eigenvectors to assess discrepancies between the underlying dynamics of the original and generated data. This approach not only quantifies the preservation of essential dynamic characteristics but also provides interpretability by pinpointing which modes have collapsed. We validate DMD-GEN on both synthetic and real-world datasets using various generative models, including TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and DiffusionTS. The results demonstrate that DMD-GEN correlates well with traditional evaluation metrics for static data while offering the advantage of applicability to dynamic data. This work offers for the first time a definition of mode collapse for time series, improving understanding, and forming the basis of our tool for assessing and improving generative models in the time series domain.",

The authors introduce a novel definition of mode collapse tailored specifically to time series data and propose a new metric, DMD-GEN, for its quantitative evaluation. DMD-GEN leverages Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to identify coherent spatio-temporal patterns and uses Optimal Transport to quantify discrepancies between real and generated data. The metric is tested across various recent time series generative models. Experimental results demonstrate DMD-GEN's effectiveness in evaluating the time series generative models."

However, the paper lacks a comparative analysis with models that are prone to mode collapse. It\u2019s essential to provide such comparisons to verify the metric\u2019s capability to discern between generative models that do and do not suffer from mode collapse.\n- The robustness across different types of time series data is not thoroughly discussed, particularly for non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio given the results on the stock dataset (please refer to Question 1 for a detailed concern).\n- The presentation of results in figures and tables could be more self-contained. Specifically, the captions of Figures 1 and 2 should briefly explain the depicted results. Additionally, Table 1 should clearly indicate whether higher or lower values represent better performance."

                "value": "1. The differences between epoch 0 and the final epoch are significant in the comparisons of DMD eigenvalues of the original and generated time series across various datasets, with an exception noted in the stock dataset. Specifically, in Figure 2, the generated samples closely match the actual data from the start at epoch 0, with a slight improvement after the final epoch. Does it suggest that the DMD-GEN metric might not be as effective for highly non-stationary time series with low signal-to-noise ratio like stocks, compared to other types of data?\n2. Do the results on the stock dataset in Figure 2 differ from Figure 6?\n3. I am interested in exploring how the proposed DMD-GEN metric performs when applied to time series generated using traditional time series generation methods, e.g., Bootstrap. Could you extend your experiments to include this technique and provide the corresponding results?\n4. Can you discuss the limitations of the DMD-GEN metric? Are there particular characteristics of time series datasets that might limit DMD-GEN's applicability, based on your current insight?"

Can you elaborate this from a data-driven perspective? (i.e., how the number of sample affect the noise robustness?)\n* The experiments are not convincing. Please include more summary statistics of the generated data, and compare with baselines. For example, it's well-known that stock data have many important  summary statistics like volatility, moving average...e.t.c. It's only fair to show that the proposal achieve more similar summary statistics to ensure its efficacy. \n* Is Thm. 3.4 your own result or from previous work?
