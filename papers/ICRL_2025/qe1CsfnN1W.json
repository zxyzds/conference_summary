    "title": "Causal Effect Estimation with Mixed Latent Confounders and Post-treatment Variables",
    "abstract": "Causal inference from observational data has attracted considerable attention among researchers. One main obstacle to drawing valid causal conclusions is handling of confounders. As the direct measurement of confounders may not always be feasible, recent methods seek to address the confounding bias via proxy variables, i.e., variables postulated to be causally related to unobserved confounders. However, the selected proxies may scramble both latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables in practice, where existing methods risk biasing the estimation by unintentionally controlling for variables affected by the treatment. In this paper, we systematically investigate the bias of latent post-treatment variables, i.e., latent post-treatment bias, in causal effect estimation. We first derive the bias of existing covariate adjustment-based methods when selected proxies scramble both latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables, which we demonstrate can be arbitrarily bad. We then propose a novel Confounder-identifiable VAE (CiVAE) to address the bias. CiVAE is built upon a mild assumption that the prior of latent variables that generate the proxy belongs to a general exponential family with at least one invertible sufficient statistic in the factorized part. Based on this assumption, we show that latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables can be individually identified up to simple bijective transformations. We then prove that with individual identification, the intractable disentanglement problem of latent confounders and post-treatment variables can be transformed to a tractable conditional independence test problem. Finally, we prove that the true causal effects can be unbiasedly estimated with transformed confounders inferred by CiVAE. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CiVAE is significantly more robust to latent post-treatment bias than existing methods.",

This is a challenging scenario where conventional methods may yield biased estimates of treatment effects. To correct the bias, this paper proposes a novel method, namely Confounder-identifiable VAE (CiVAE), to estimate treatment effects. The paper provides some theoretical guarantees for the method. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that the proposed method performs well in empirical applications."

Providing some high-level intuitions in this section could be helpful. \n- I am not sure why there is always a clear separation between latent confounders and post-treatment variables. It is possible that the value of latent confounders (e.g., health indicators) can be changed by the treatment, and thus, these latent confounders also seem to be post-treatment variables."

Please ensure consistency in the directions of M. Or add more examples to show if the case T->M<-Y happened. In line 269, it states, \"However, since both C and M form fork structures with the outcome Y (see Fig. 2-(c)).\" I am wondering why M forms fork structures.\n\n2. Z is the true latent space (Z = [C, M]). According to the paper, there exists a bi-directional path between M and Y. Could you explain why only p(Z|Y,T) is considered? If T \u2192 M \u2192 Y, I agree with using p(Z|T); if T \u2192 M \u2190 Y, I agree with p(Z|T,Y). I suggest considering different cases using different forms of p(\u00b7).\n\n3. More interestingly, if Z also includes C, then is C identifiable? I am wondering if C is treated as a general case in CEVAE without considering identifiability. Even with iVAE, additional information may be missing to guide identifiability.\n\n4. A related work may need to be included. [1] discusses the iVAE learning process of the front-door adjustment set, which is a very similar setting to this paper. I suggest adding a discussion of this in the related work section.\n\n[1] Causal Inference with Conditional Front-Door Adjustment and Identifiable Variational Autoencoder in ICLR 2024."
