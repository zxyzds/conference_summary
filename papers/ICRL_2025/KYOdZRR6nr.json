    "title": "GALA: Geometry-Aware Local Adaptive Grids for Detailed 3D Generation",
    "abstract": "We propose GALA, a novel representation of 3D shapes that (i) excels at capturing and reproducing complex geometry and surface details, (ii) is computationally efficient, and (iii) lends itself to 3D generative modelling with modern, diffusion-based schemes. The key idea of GALA is to exploit both the global sparsity of surfaces within a 3D volume and their local surface properties. *Sparsity* is promoted by covering only the 3D object boundaries, not empty space, with an ensemble of tree root voxels. Each voxel contains an octree to further limit storage and compute to regions that contain surfaces. *Adaptivity* is achieved by fitting one local and geometry-aware coordinate frame in each non-empty leaf node. Adjusting the orientation of the local grid, as well as the anisotropic scales of its axes, to the local surface shape greatly increases the amount of  detail that can be stored in a given amount of memory, which in turn allows for quantization without loss of quality. With our optimized C++/CUDA implementation, GALA can be fitted to an object in less than 10 seconds. Moreover, the representation can efficiently be flattened and manipulated with transformer networks. We provide a cascaded generation pipeline capable of generating 3D shapes with great geometric detail.",

                "value": "The paper presents a storage-efficient new representation of 3D triangle surface meshes, GALA, which can be used for 3D generation trained by a transformer. To create the proposed representation, voxel tree root nodes are initialized over the surface of the mesh using FPS. In the local adaptive grid extraction step, the grid orientation is aligned with the geometric structure using PCA on the local normal vectors, and the grid is rescaled using a histogram. With this representation, the authors show that 3D reconstruction and generation can be performed using cascaded diffusion models. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in 3D reconstruction and generation, both quantitatively and qualitatively."

It could be argued this work is limited to being an adaptive version of Mosaic-SDF, and that most choices made in the algorithm are the same choices any researcher would made if attempting to extend M-SDF to an adaptive realm (the authors of M-SDF themselves even mention \u201cadding local coordinate frames\u201d as a potential future work avenue). The authors of this work address this and also mention the cascading generation strategy as a difference with M-SDF; however, the magnitude of this contribution is not particularly explored: what would have happened if they used an identical flow-matching strategy to the one in M-SDF?\n\nClarity of writing. Several key aspects of the work are missing or unclear, to the point in which I don\u2019t believe I understand important sections of the algorithm (see \u201cQuestions\u201d below). Additionally, perhaps due to LaTeX template changes, groups of citations that should be grouped in parentheses are not, making reading difficult (e.g., 053, 080). The code link also seems to be missing.\n\nNonetheless, I do not think these weaknesses justify rejecting this work, which undoubtedly outperforms the state of the art and will definitely save authors\u2019 time if they wish to improve the M-SDF performance in the future."

                "value": "- How is each grid subdivided? As far as I can tell, the only explanation of this subdivision is \u201cwe recursively deduce the further levels of tree nodes in an overlapping way where we slightly expand the divided spaces at each level by ratio \u03b1.\u201d Which is far from enough detail for a reader to replicate the results. Which cells are subdivided? According to which logic? Along which axis?\n- How is a mesh extracted from this adaptive grid? Are the authors setting up some regular grid and interpolating values at grid cells using Eq. (2), and then using Marching Cubes or some other reconstruction algorithm? Or are they somehow extracting a mesh directly from the stored SDF data at the adaptive cells? The latter seems very non-trivial and would be an important contribution on its own.\n- What does \u201cthe weighting function which is defined by the infinity ball centered at the grid center pig and rotation matrix Oi\u201d mean? Isn\u2019t \\omega(x,i) just Eq. (3)?\n- It was very hard for me to follow Sec. 3.2., I think partly because of the notation used: Are x_v (lowercase) and X_V (uppercase) the same thing? Am I right in understanding that in this cascading scheme, given an initial tree X_0, the grid configuration X_V and the SDF values at those points will not be affected by the conditioning? Since the class label is only involved in Step 1."

For the comparison, the numerical results and the visual figures show a significant performance improvement over the baseline method in ShapeNet.

                "value": "1. While this proposed expression can enhance the details of the reconstruction, I think it is very challenging for diffusion networks to generate the explicit parameters for the root node, grid values, and grid configuration step by step. If some parameter predictions are incorrect, it can greatly affect the quality of the geometry in the subsequent steps. According to the figures in the supplementary, some structures of the generated meshes are noisy. This also limits the practical application of this expression in generative models. It would be better to discuss in the conclusion, or analyze how the errors propagate in the steps and ultimately affect the geometry's quality.\n\n2. I think the authors have omitted some relevant citations regarding XCube and OctTree. XCube employs sparse convolution to achieve high-quality reconstruction and geometric compression, and it has also demonstrated its applicability to generative models. It would be beneficial to include additional quantitative and qualitative experiments and discussions focused on reconstruction quality, compression efficiency, and the applicability to 3D generative models.\n\n3. The authors only tested on some simple geometric details of ShapeNet; it would be better if they could show some more complex results, like objects in Objaverse or Thingiverse.\n\n[1] Ren, Xuanchi, et al., XCube: Large-Scale 3D Generative Modeling using Sparse Voxel Hierarchies, CVPR 2024\n\n[2] Bojun Xiong, et al., OctFusion: Octree-based Diffusion Models for 3D Shape Generation, Arxiv 2024\n\n[3] Objaverse: https://objaverse.allenai.org/\n\n[4] Thingi10K: https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/"
