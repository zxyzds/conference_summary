    "title": "Physics-Informed Decentralized Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "The integration of domain knowledge into the learning process of artificial intelligence (AI) has received significant attention in the last few years. Most of the approaches proposed so far have focused on centralized machine learning scenarios, with less emphasis on how domain knowledge can be effectively integrated in decentralized settings. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of domain knowledge integration in distributed settings, specifically in the context of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). We propose the Physics-Informed DFL (PIDFL) architecture by integrating domain knowledge expressed as differential equations. We introduce a serverless data aggregation algorithm for PIDFL, prove its convergence, and discuss its computational complexity. We performed comprehensive experiments across various datasets and demonstrated that  PIDFL significantly reduces average loss across diverse applications. This highlights the potential of PIDFL and offers a promising avenue for improving decentralized learning through domain knowledge integration.",

The incorporation of domain knowledge is insufficiently elaborated. In which aspects is it utilized? A summary dedicated to this would be beneficial.\n3. There are errors in the theoretical proofs. In the penultimate equation on line 362, summing over $i$ includes both $w_{ij}$ and $\\Theta$, meaning $i$ and $w_{ij}$ cannot be grouped in parentheses independently. Additionally, the result on line 367 does not lead to the result on line 394, as $\\gamma$ does not exist. The authors need to thoroughly verify their proofs.\n4. The algorithms selected for comparison in the simulations are more than five years old, which might be outdated.
