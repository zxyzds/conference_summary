    "title": "Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images",
    "abstract": "As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. \n\nIn this work, we first demonstrate that the initial noise used in the diffusion process can itself be a distortion-free watermarking method for images.\nHowever, detecting the watermark requires comparing the latent noise of an image to all previously used initial noises. Additionally, the initial noise may still be susceptible to some removal attacks.\nTo mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.\nThe project code is anonymously available at https://github.com/anonymousiclr2025submission/Hidden-in-the-Noise.",

                "value": "This paper investigates reverse vulnerabilities in diffusion watermarking methods to forgery and removal attacks. Specifically, the authors propose WIND, a two-stage watermarking framework that first embeds a unique group identifier within the initial noise of a diffusion model using Fourier patterns and then searches the reconstructed noise within the noise group to identify the match. Empirical results show that WIND can achieve better detection performance and robustness against various attacks."

There is a lack of smooth logical connection between the two paragraphs of the abstract. The first paragraph primarily discusses deepfakes and the limitations of current watermarking methods, but there is no clear transition when moving to the new framework in the second paragraph. This makes it difficult for readers to understand why the new method is necessary and how it relates to the issues discussed earlier.\n2. The interpretation of the experimental results is insufficient. Descriptions of the tables and figures are very clear, but a deeper analysis of these results could enhance the paper. For example, in Table 2, while the changes in similarity are displayed, it would be beneficial to explore the potential reasons behind these changes and how they impact the overall robustness of the method.\n3. In the experimental section, while images generated by your framework are presented, there is a lack of quantitative analysis of image quality. \n4. There is a lack of the performance across a broader range of inference steps beyond the 50-step setting currently used. Testing various inference step counts (e.g., 20, 50, 100, and 200 steps) can help determine how the step count affects model performance in terms of robustness."

Are there ways in which this problem can be resolved/handled?\n2. It seems like this method relies on the (approximate) invertibility property of DDIM. Is so, please mention this in section 2.2.

The evaluation of different watermarking methods is somewhat limited.

While the paper makes significant claims regarding robustness, the robustness evaluation itself is not comprehensive. Beyond image transformations and regeneration attacks, there are numerous adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses greater capability.

While WIND presents a promising adaptation of existing noise-based watermarking techniques, it does not fundamentally diverge from the concepts established in Tree-Ring and RingID. The addition of a two-stage detection process is a novel enhancement but builds on the same theoretical foundation of Fourier-based watermarking in noise. The primary innovation lies in the grouping and search-space reduction, which increases efficiency and robustness but does not introduce a fundamentally new approach to noise-based watermarking.\n2. The multi-stage approach, while innovative, introduces complexity that may hinder ease of adoption. Managing group identifiers and applying Fourier-based transformations within the initial noise may pose challenges for large-scale implementations. Additionally, as the number of watermarked images grows, the demand for managing extensive initial noise records could impact computational scalability."
