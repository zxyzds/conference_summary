    "title": "MLGLP: Multi-Scale Line-Graph Link Prediction based on Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "This manuscript proposes a multi-scale link prediction approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed method - Multi-Scale Line-Graph Link Prediction (MLGLP) - learns the graph structure and extracts effective representative features of graph edges to address challenges such as information loss and handle multi-scale information. This approach utilizes embedding vectors generated by GNNs from enclosing subgraphs. While expanding GNN layers can capture more intricate relations, it often leads to overs-smoothing. To mitigate this issue, we propose constructing coarse-grained graphs at three distinct scales to uncover complex relations. To apply multi-scale subgraphs in GNNs without using pooling layers that lead to information loss, we convert each subgraph into a line-graph and reformulate the task as a node classification problem. The hierarchical structure facilitates exploration across various levels of abstraction, fostering deeper comprehension of the relationships and dependencies inherent within the graph. The proposed method is applied on link prediction problem, which can be modelled as a graph classification problem. We perform extensive experiments on several well-known benchmarks and compare the results with state-of-the-art link prediction methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in terms of average precision and area under the curve.",

                "value": "1. There are some notation issues; the model name is inconsistently defined throughout the paper, sometimes referred to as MLGLP, other times as MSGL or MSLGLP (as noted in the caption of Table 3), and occasionally as MSLG (in section 5.1). Additionally, the tables display varying levels of decimal precision (sometimes three decimal places, sometimes two), which should be standardized.\n2. There are concerns regarding baseline comparisons. For instance, the AP of GAE on the Cora dataset should be significantly higher than that of GCN based on the original paper, yet the authors report it being lower by ten points in their experiments, which needs to be explained to maintain credibility.\n3. The method involves sampling subgraphs, converting them to line graphs, and then performing node classification, which appears to result in high time complexity. Although the authors analyze time complexity, the discussion is not in-depth. They should compare it with the time complexity of two other subgraph-based methods and also include training time comparisons.\n4. The baselines compared in the paper seem somewhat outdated; for example, reference [1] proposes a line graph-based method for link prediction.\n5. The core innovation of this paper appears to be the application of multi-scale and line graph concepts to link prediction tasks. However, the paper lacks ablation studies on these two components, such as whether the line graph contributes to performance improvement, and it does not compare the final concatenation method. This makes it difficult to ascertain the key factors driving the model's improved performance.\n[1]Zhang Z, Sun S, Ma G, et al. Line graph contrastive learning for link prediction[J].

Can the authors conduct ablation studies to assess the individual contributions of the multi-scale and line graph components to the overall performance of the model?"

Further clarification on this aspect would enhance the analysis.\n* Figure 5 provides valuable visual insights; however, it lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, hindering a fair assessment of MLGLP's performance. The authors should clarify whether the identified clusters correspond to meaningful patterns and provide an experimental analysis to support this.\n* There are several presentation issues that require careful proofreading. For instance, Section 6 contains a dangling \"However\" above Table 3 that should be addressed."
