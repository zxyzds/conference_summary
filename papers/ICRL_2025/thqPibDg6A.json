    "title": "Efficiently pre-training language models with mixtures of cluster-oriented, trainability-aware experts",
    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are pre-trained on large-scale corpora from diverse data sources, encapsulating knowledge across various domains, with their feature spaces often displaying clustering structures. The mixture of experts (MoEs) approach is commonly used to scale up model learning capabilities to handle such complexities; however, the fine-grained learning dynamics at the expert level remain largely unexplored. This work analyzes the spatial and temporal characteristics of these clustering structures and examines their impact on the fine-grained trainability of individual experts. Our analysis builds on the singular spectrum of the feature and Jacobian spaces leading to two key observations. First, a few top singular vectors from the feature matrix are sufficient to capture the layer-wise feature cluster patterns. More interestingly, the maximum singular value of the Jacobian matrix reveals conflicts between different feature clusters, and experts exhibit varying levels of trainability, completing their learning asynchronously during training.\nInspired by these insights, we proposed mixtures of cluster-guided, trainability-aware experts (MO-CTE), with \nan efficient routing method to mitigate inter-cluster conflicts to improve expert trainability and \na simple yet effective criterion for early stopping low-trainability experts, thus reducing total training costs. \nWe evaluate the proposed MO-CTE across extensive datasets and tasks. Experimental results indicate that MO-CTE accelerates convergence by approximately 37\\% in test perplexity and 30\\% in downstream tasks, and improves performance by 3.6\\% over baselines when consuming similar computation resources.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel method, MO-CTE, for pre-training language models via mixtures of cluster-oriented trainability-aware experts. The paper first presents an analysis behind the inherent clustering of a language model's feature space and finds that a small number of the top singular vectors effectively capture the spatial cluster structures within it. The paper then uses these findings to propose the MO-CTE method, which leverages clustering to guide experts to focus on specific clusters and uses the Jacobian to assess expert trainability, which consecutively defines whether a specific expert should be frozen. The proposed method is evaluated on 140M and 750M transformer-based GPT models across a range of metrics, including test perplexity and downstream accuracy on 10 benchmarks."

                "value": "1. There are important details that lack clarity in the paper's descriptions, making it hard to understand the findings and methodology. \n\t1. In the analysis section, the figures lack important details. What is the connection between Figure 2 and Figure 1? Figure 1 shows 5 clusters while figure 2 shows 3. Did the authors verify that the 3 clusters correspond to semantically meaningful topics? What is the data size used to compute these plots and why is the number of bullet points so small?\n\t2. The experimental setup also lacks details. It is not clear in the main paper which datasets have been used for training, what is their size in tokens and how these datasets were mixed. (While the appendix mentions relevant information there are still details missing and I would be expecting more details in the main paper.)  Additionally, I was not able to find details about the baseline setup. \n      3. Also, there are insufficient details in the methodology section, including the exact setup behind the \"LoRA-like\" experts and the exact criteria behind line 4 of Algorithm 1 (\"if cluster structure is detected in a low-dimensional space then\"). Moreover, it is hard for the reader to understand how the clusters are initialized at the beginning of the training process, since the algorithm relies on the model's training dynamics.\n2. It is unclear how effectively the method can generalize across various settings in practice. The proposed method depends on thresholds ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$ in Algorithm 1), which might be hard to determine for new models or domains while at the same time there is no quantitative evidence of the method's stability with respect to these thresholds. The analysis is guided by the findings based on the GPT architecture, however it is not clear whether it applies across architectures. For example, the findings do not seem to be as prevalent in the analysis of BERT models in Figure 4(b). Similarly, given the lack of clarity behind the training datasets and its composition, it is unclear whether the findings will apply to realistic LLM training scenarios with large variety of data, including web documents. \n3. The paper has limited baselines and misses relevant work. The paper compares to just a single baseline and Switch Transformers while there already exists previous work stemming from the Branch-Train-Merge (Li et al., 2022) literature, including Branch-Train-Mix (Sukhbaatar et al., 2024) and C-BTM (Gururangal et al., 2023). It is unclear, how MO-CTE compares to such work, especially C-BTM which uses a cluster-based approach for routing in mixture-of-experts. \n\n\nReferences: \n- Li et al., 2022: Branch-Train-Merge: Embarrassingly Parallel Training of Expert Language Models\n- Gururangan et al., 2023: Scaling Expert Language Models with Unsupervised Domain Discovery\n- Sukhbaatar et al., 2024: Branch-Train-MiX: Mixing Expert LLMs into a Mixture-of-Experts LLM"

This forces readers to spend time comparing the information described in the images to find any differences. It may also give the impression that this is a tactic to inflate the word count.\n2\u3001It is well known that pre-training is a resource-intensive task, requiring a large amount of GPU memory even for small models. However, the author's pre-training setup differs significantly from traditional pre-training settings (e.g., GPT-3). For instance, in Table 5 of the appendix, the author sets the batch sizes for the 140M GPT and 750M GPT models to 40 and 48, respectively, whereas the GPT-3 paper\u2019s Table2.1[1] records a batch size of 500 for models of the same size. It seems that the author is using fine-tuning settings for a pre-training paradigm, raising doubts about the reliability of the conclusions.\n3\u3001The dataset tested by the author in the experiments is not a commonly used benchmark, making it difficult to compare with other works. Additionally, the evaluated datasets are primarily classification tasks, lacking evaluation on generation tasks.\n4\u3001The author's description of the clustering process is not clear enough. From my understanding, it should involve training for a few steps, then performing clustering once the features are divided into several clusters, and determining the number of experts based on that.\n5\u3001What are \"LoRA-like experts\"? Since LoRA is a fine-tuning architecture, applying it to a pre-training framework would likely result in a low-rank bypass structure. Such an MoE (Mixture of Experts) structure in a pre-training framework would likely struggle to achieve the original SMoE\u2019s goals of expanding dimensions and sparsification.\n6\u3001Since the SVD process cannot be accelerated by GPUs, performing SVD at every step is very time-consuming. The inclusion of Algorithm 1 by the author may further slow down the training process. The author needs to provide specific runtime data to demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency.\n7.
