    "title": "Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension",
    "abstract": "Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt correct geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic benchmarks for peptide drug development are still lacking.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce **PepHAR**, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring valid peptide structures.\nBy combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables de novo peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of **PepHAR** in computational peptide design.",

                "value": "This paper introduces PepHAR (Hotspot-driven Autoregressive peptide design), a novel three-stage approach for designing peptides that can bind to specific target proteins. The method acknowledges the critical role of \"hot spot\" residues in peptide-protein binding and addresses key challenges in computational peptide design. The three stages consist of: (1) a founding stage that uses an energy-based density model to identify and sample key hot spot residues, (2) an extension stage that autoregressively builds peptide fragments from these hot spots using a dihedral angle-based approach ensuring proper geometry, and (3) a correction stage that refines the complete structure through optimization. The authors also introduce a new \"scaffold generation\" task that better reflects real-world peptide drug development scenarios. When compared to state-of-the-art baselines (RFDiffusion, ProteinGenerator, PepFlow), PepHAR demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics including structural validity, geometric accuracy, binding site accuracy, and novelty/diversity of generated peptides, while maintaining competitive stability and binding affinity."

                "value": "Major:\n1. For different sampling K values, does the binder length remain constant for the same target protein?\n\n2. RMSD might be somewhat misleading since peptides can still bind effectively with very different geometries, which is actually desirable - valid binders that show different binding modes from native ones.\n\n3. Regarding Novelty, especially for sequences, what is the source of this novelty? Does it primarily come from scaffold sites or contact sites? If changes are mainly in scaffold sites compared to native ones, this metric might be misleading and trivial for a designed binder.\n\n4. In the Dataset section, the binding pocket is defined using a 10\u00c5 radius, while for BSR in the supplementary material, binding sites are defined using a 6\u00c5 radius. Why are different values used?\n\nMinor:\n1. Authors should specify that they are performing peptide binder design, not peptide design, as these are distinctly different tasks.\n\n2. In the Dataset section (Lines 276-377), please clarify the distinction between the 158 examples and the 8,207 additional examples."

This suggests that PepHAR may not always generate peptides with geometries that are fully consistent with the formation of peptide bonds. Additionally, PepHAR's Affinity metric indicates room for improvement, potentially due to the density model's limitations in sufficiently approximating the complex energy landscapes involved in peptide-target interactions.\n2. **Limited Exploration in Scaffold Generation**: The scaffold generation scenario only considers a small number of hotspots (K=1, 2, 3), with baseline comparisons limited to K=3. This narrow exploration may not capture the full spectrum of possible hotspot configurations, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to more complex scenarios.\n3. **Density Model Limitations**: The energy-based density model used in PepHAR might not fully approximate the intricate energy landscapes of peptide interactions, which could impact the model's ability to generate peptides with optimal binding affinities."

                "value": "The authors present a novel de-novo peptide design method, PepHAR, aimed at generating binders for specific sites on a target protein. The method leverages the concept of \"hotspots\", a small number of residues at protein-protein interfaces that contribute most of the binding energy, with other residues acting as \"scaffolds\" to stabilize the interface. PepHAR\u2019s peptide prediction process is based on three main components: (1) A neural network trained using a noise contrastive estimation (NCE) loss to differentiate between real interface residues (ground truth) and noisy counterparts altered with spatial perturbations. The authors use Langevin dynamics to sample from this energy-based model. (2) A second neural network that builds a polypeptide chain autoregressively by predicting the phi-psi dihedral angles for each subsequent residue. This model, trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), predicts angles for residues extending either direction along the chain. (3) A final correction step to refine the predicted peptide structures, addressing minor inaccuracies like dihedral angle errors, steric clashes, or chain breaks. This stage optimizes dihedrals based on neighboring residues and rebuilds the peptide, comparing it to the initial prediction. An objective function minimizes the distance between the rebuilt and predicted structures while ensuring angles align with the learned dihedral distribution.\nPepHAR was evaluated for de-novo peptide generation with up to three hotspots, comparing favorably to other leading methods like RFdiffusion, PepFlow, and ProteinGenerator. An ablation study also confirmed the significance of each method component. Overall, PepHAR generated peptides with lower RMSD to the native structure than other methods, showing its effectiveness in autoregressively designing peptides for target protein interfaces."

Additionally, are the k=3 hotspots located within disordered regions, or are they typically in helices, where the backbone might be easier to infill? I would suggest to include a brief analysis of the secondary structure composition of the generated peptides and compare it to native structures (or a representative set of native structures), as well as an examination of where the hotspots tend to be located in terms of secondary structure elements.\n\n(2) When multiple hotspots are specified, fragments are grown from each hotspot. How does the network ensure that these initially disconnected fragments will eventually fit together? Is this addressed during the extension phase or in the polishing stage? Furthermore, is there a risk that extended chains from different fragments might fail to converge into a closed structure? It could be useful to elaborate on the fragment assembly method, and add statistics on how often fragments successfully connect and if there are any strategies used to ensure proper assembly or safeguard this process."
