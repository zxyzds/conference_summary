    "title": "Common 7B Language Models Already Possess Strong Math Capabilities",
    "abstract": "It was once believed that mathematical capabilities in language models required either large model scales or extensive math-related data pre-training. However, this paper demonstrates that the small-scale LLaMA-2 7B model already possesses strong mathematical potential. This is evidenced by its impressive scores of 97.6% on GSM8K benchmark and 70% on MATH benchmark, achieved by selecting the oracle response from 1024 generations. Equipped GPT-4 Turbo as an additional verification, LLaMA-2 7B also achieves 91.8% accuracy on GSM8K benchmark. This indicates that the primary issue within current models is the difficulty in consistently eliciting the inherent mathematical capabilities. We find that scaling up synthetic SFT data, which proves to be nearly as effective as real data, can significantly enhance the reliability of generating correct answers. Surprisingly, even with approximately one million samples, we observe no clear performance saturation. And our method is more efficient with large data scale than previous works. This approach achieves an accuracy of 82.4% on GSM8K and 40.1% on MATH using LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo. Our 70B model even exceeds an early version of GPT-4 on MATH and out-of-domain Hungarian National High School Math Exam. These results demonstrate our method significantly elicits the general mathematical capabilities of language models. Also, we provide insights into scaling behaviors across different reasoning complexities.",

                "value": "The paper asserted that  mathematical abilities of small-scale language models, LLaMA-2 7B, inherently possess strong mathematical capabilities. They prompt the pre-trained LLaMA-2 7B model to generate multiple answers (up to 1024) for each question in math benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. By selecting the correct answer from these numerous attempts (an \"oracle\" approach), they find that the model can achieve high accuracy (97.6% on GSM8K and 70% on MATH). To improve consistency, they hypothesize that increasing the amount of supervised fine-tuning data can help the model learn to produce correct answers more reliably. They use a stronger language model, GPT-4 Turbo, to generate a large number of synthetic math problems and their solutions. However, the reference questions are from  GSM8K and  MATH. In other words, the new questions are similar to the questions in GSM8K and MATH. Which ends up with overfitting towards to solving GSM8K and MATH."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1 Training Data Overlap Concerns: There\u2019s a significant possibility that LLaMA-2's pretraining data includes or paraphrases the benchmarks used in evaluation, especially given the unknowns around its training corpus. This overlap could mean that the results simply \"unlock\" capabilities that were already in the model due to exposure during pretraining. Testing on a model where pretraining data is known and does not include the benchmarks would provide a more credible assessment.\n2 Limited Benchmark Selection: The focus on GSM8K and MATH restricts evaluation to high school and grade school mathematics. More challenging, diverse benchmarks like MMLU (especially college-level sections) and OlympiadBench could provide a stronger test of the model's robustness. Success on OlympiadBench (IMO) [3], for example, would be a stronger indication of broader mathematical reasoning abilities.\n3 Overstated Claims of Generality: The paper frequently implies that its findings apply to \"common 7B LMs,\" yet the experiments focus solely on LLaMA-2 7B. Generalizing these results to other 7B models without further testing is premature.\n4 No Discussion on Synthetic Data Risks: The paper lacks a discussion on \"model collapse\" from synthetic data, an issue documented in the literature [2]. While using GPT-4 may mitigate some risks, the absence of model degradation across such extensive data scaling is unusual. This aspect needs further exploration to explain the improvement consistency.\n5 Large Data Volume Requirements: The use of 1024 generations per problem (yielding up to 76M examples) raises questions about the efficiency and feasibility of this approach. Such large data requirements, combined with the potential overlap between synthetic and benchmark data, make the setup less compelling.\n6 Reliance on GPT-4 as Judge: The use of GPT-4 to evaluate generated responses without validating its correlation with human evaluations weakens the reliability of the reported improvements. A smaller-scale human evaluation or citation demonstrating alignment between GPT-4 judgments and human judgments would improve credibility.\n7 Power Law Claim without Evidence: The claim of \"power law scaling\" is unsupported by a functional form or detailed analysis. Without a clearly defined functional relationship, the observed improvements should be framed as scaling trends, not power laws.\nReservations - Writing Concerns:\n8 Misleading Introduction on Emergence: The introduction on emergence theory is confusing (It\u2019s known emergence is caused by metrics now and in addition this is not how we grade people) and does not add value to the main narrative. It distracts from the paper's core contributions and should be revised or strongly suggested its removed.\n9 Lack of Quantitative Detail in the Abstract: Statements like \"significant improvement\" are vague without absolute or relative performance changes. Quantitative results and implications should be included in the abstract to clearly communicate the impact of the findings.\n10 Clarity and Readability: The paper would benefit from a thorough review by a native English speaker. There are multiple areas where phrasing is unclear or lacks precision, detracting from the scientific rigor of the presentation.\n11 Captions and Figures: The captions do not provide sufficient context or summaries of the figures' main takeaways. Including summary values (like percentages) in the captions or directly in the figures would make it easier for readers to interpret the results.\n12 \u201cTable 2 shows the results.\u201d This type of sentence raises major concerns about the writing of the whole paper."

Lack of significant novelty or surprising results: Prior work has shown that extensive math-related data pre-training improves the math capabilities of 7B scale models. These results, illustrated even w/in the first sentence of the abstract, reduces the novelty of this work. It follows that if 7B scale models have stronger math performance after pretraining on more math related data, that we can similarly distill strong model math perf into smaller models in post-training. \n2. Lack of depth of analysis: you make an important observation that \"The primary issue is the lack of guarantee that the correct answer will be dug out, as most generations are incorrect.\", but this point is not deeply studied in the rest of the paper. The initial motivating observation that 7B models high have pass@1024 is under explored in empirical experiments, theoretical analysis, and final conclusion.\n3. Severe lack of breadth:\n a. the lack of evaluation on llama3 is a glaring miss that the authors likely foresaw would arise during reviews. Given that the empirically strong performance of distilled llama2 is one of the strongest conclusions of this paper, running the analysis on llama3 is left as an obviously open question\nb. The analysis conducted only on math and gsm8k. It's not clear how limited the author's claims are to these benchmarks.

The paper claims that the presence of correct answers within these 1024 generated responses suggests that the model already possesses strong math abilities, and the observed performance issues are due to instability in extracting responses, which the paper refers to as a \"ranking issue\". To alleviate this, the authors propose using an external LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to generate synthetic data for finetuning, which can increase accuracy on various math benchmarks."

                "value": "1- The observation that increasing the number of generations improves the probability of obtaining a correct answer is not new to this work. For example, figure 4 from [1] reports the same observation on GSM8K.\n\n2- Most importantly, the use of pass@1024 to claim a model's \"capability\" is methodologically questionable. Consider this extreme example for clarity: Imagine the target task is finding a path from start to end in a maze. If I write a program that randomly tests paths in the maze, with enough generations (depending on the maze size and difficulty), one of the outputs will be correct. Does that mean my program is capable of solving mazes? While LLMs don't output random tokens, and this is an extreme example for demonstration purposes, the overall situation is similar.\n\n3- The paper assumes that higher accuracy on GSM8K indicates better 'mathematical reasoning' capabilities. Recent works such as [2] suggest that models do not understand mathematical concepts and rely on pattern matching and memorization, which could explain the reported improved results from using synthetic data for finetuning in this work. Note that the experiments in this paper does not provide any evidence for reasoning improvement, including the OOD experiments. For instance, the Hungarian National High School Math Exam is very similar to the MATH benchmark, and we observe from figure 2 that training on 120K synthetic examples from MATH leads to ~30% more accuracy than training on 480K synthetic examples from GSM8K. This raises questions about whether this benchmark is truly OOD for MATH, and whether the improvements reflect enhanced \"mathematical reasoning\" or simply exposure to similar questions in the synthetic data, especially given that we cannot rule out GPT-4's prior exposure to these questions.\n\n4- Regarding the generation/use of synthetic data, there are no particularly new insights. There is no formal mechanism to guarantee the correctness of problems and solutions. In fact, Figure 8 of the paper (in Appendix) shows that the reasoning mistakes of the model increase as more synthetic data is used. This relates to my previous comments that there is no evidence (neither in the literature nor this work) that these LLMs possess \"mathematical understanding/reasoning capabilities\". However, there are several pieces of evidence, including this work, showing that the models rely on seeing similar questions and memorizing overall patterns to solve similar questions.\n\nOverall, I find many of the paper's assumptions and claims to be incorrect, and the experiments do not adequately address these issues.\n\n----\nReferences:  \n[1] Shi, Chufan, et al. \"A thorough examination of decoding methods in the era of llms.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06925 (2024).\n[2] Mirzadeh, Iman, et al. \"Gsm-symbolic: Understanding the limitations of mathematical reasoning in large language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.05229 (2024).  \n[3] Zhang, Hugh, et al. \"A careful examination of large language model performance on grade school arithmetic.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.00332 (2024)."
