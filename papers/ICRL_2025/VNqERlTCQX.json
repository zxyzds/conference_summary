    "title": "Similarity-Driven Regularization for Aligning Chemical and Latent Spaces in Molecular Design",
    "abstract": "Generative models play a pivotal role in molecular design by effectively generating target molecules. Among these, generative models with latent space stand out due to their robust latent space representation capabilities, powerful dimensionality reduction ability and controllability of generation. In molecular design applications, generative models with latent space convert input molecules into latent variables, capturing essential molecular features including both structural and property-related characteristics. Ideally, similar molecules should map to proximate latent variables. However, previous studies have shown an inconsistency between molecular similarity in the chemical space and that in the latent space. This inconsistency will impede the accurate representation and complicate subsequent design process,such as leading to higher optimization budget. To address this, we propose Molecular Similarity-Aware Consistency Regularization (MSCR), a straightforward regularization approach aimed at preserving the molecule similarity consistency. Our method proposes a brief but effective regularization technique to align chemical space and latent space,clearly reflect similarity relationships in latent space. We leverage Matched Molecules Pairs (MMPs) to introduce more robust similarity information than other conventional augmentation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSCR not only maintains molecules pairs similarity but also enhance optimization performance in molecular latent space tasks, without additional costs. Furthermore, our visualizations highlight molecular inconsistencies, thus underscoring the significance of our approach and improving the interpretability and relevance of our work.",

The authors assume that similar molecules should map to similar latent variables.\nMatched Molecule Pairs (MMPs) are introduced to serve as a more robust augmentation method. \nBased on such augmentation, straightforward regularization terms are applied to training variational autoencoders from both the perspectives of metrics and distribution. \nExperiments show that the proposed methods can make the latent embeddings of similar molecules maintain similar and also improve the performance on downstream tasks, such as molecular optimization based on latent space."

Assessing molecular similarity is an open challenge, as minor structural changes in an atom can significantly alter a molecule's functions and properties. The authors could benefit from referencing well-known concepts such as activity cliffs (ACs) to strengthen their argument. \n\nThe use of Tanimoto Similarity as the similarity metric in chemical space, while straightforward, may not adequately capture the true 'chemical' similarity.\n\nThe experimental evaluation needs to be more comprehensive. For instance, proposed regularization terms are introduced alongside the original VAE training losses, suggesting the presence of a hyperparameter to control regularization strength. However, there is an absence of ablation studies addressing this aspect. \n\nFurthermore, while multiple methods exist for measuring molecular similarity, only one approach is utilized here, lacking post-hoc analysis. A deeper analysis is necessary to understand how increased consistency enhances the performance of Bayesian optimization.\n\nIn some cases, the reported improvements, such as with GeoLDM on QM9, are too marginal.\n\nOverall, the presentation falls short of academic standards, with several typographical errors present.\n\nSome related references are not cited in the paper. There are lots of related works that focus on semantics in latent space, though most of them are in the field of computer vision."

There is a version of this paper that optimizes for ADMET, for example, which would be a very different kind of evaluation.\n\nThe paper chooses two baselines, TransVAE and GEOLDM, and thereby tests a transformer-based and autoencoder+diffusion-based latent space It would be helpful to choose another model with a substantively different architecture to show that this method generalizes to substantially different model architectures. Also, there are other models, like MolMIM, that already attempt to solve the chemical similarity problem, so it would be imperative to compare against such a model to demonstrate the additional value added by MSCR."

Is this a metric with a precedent, and if yes, can you please cite? If you are defining your own metric, please specify its calculation.\n- Why did you choose to define distribution consistency in a way that\u2019s not symmetric (using the KL) versus using something like Jensen Shannon? \n- While there is precedent to a two-stage training approach, because of what you\u2019re trying to do here, I am surprised that it outperforms one-stage. I\u2019d be curious to see more results or information as to why this is the better training regime.\n- Interpolation results \u2014 we begin the paper using Figure 1 to highlight the problem, but we don\u2019t redo this analysis for any of the models + MSCR. I want to see a depiction of the latent space and, ideally, an interpolation between molecules in the latent space, to demonstrate that the space itself is more robustly chemically consistent."

Diffusion-based molecular generation models have become more and more popular than VAE-based and GAN-based approaches since the year 2022, but this paper discusses far less related work in this category, including Pocket2Mol [1], DiffBP [2],  DecompDiff [3], etc.\n\n2. While I appreciate the plug-and-play property of the proposed regularization, only three generative models have been evaluated experimentally, lacking an evaluation on the applicability to the most current molecular design models, especially those based on diffusion.\n\n3. The paper does not discuss well how to define \u201csimilarity\u201d in chemical space, which is the most challenging issue. For example, two \u201cstructurally\u201d similar molecules may have completely different properties, and two molecules that look completely different may perform the same function. How would the proposed regularization term handle these cases where structural similarity does not correlate with functional similarity? Perhaps a discussion or experiment on this specific aspect will be helpful.\n\n4. While the paper compares MSCR with the base models (TransVAE and GEOLDM), it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in molecular design\n\n5. There is a lack of discussion on the scalability of the proposed method to larger datasets. Additionally, the computational complexity of the MSCR algorithm could be analyzed to assess its practical applicability.\n\n6. Using consistency loss to constrain the consistency of the input and embedding space is not a new problem; it is a classic problem in the field of manifold learning. However, I have not seen any discussion with these work in this paper. More importantly, augmenting the inputs and then imposing a consistency loss is not fundamentally different from contrastive learning, especially the common graph contrastive learning methods. Considering that there are already so many contrastive learning methods for molecular generation, the technical contribution of this paper is limited.\n\n[1] Peng X, Luo S, Guan J, et al.
