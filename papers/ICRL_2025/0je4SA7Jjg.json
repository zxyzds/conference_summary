    "title": "Spatiotemporal Learning on Cell-embedded Graphs",
    "abstract": "Data-driven simulation of physical systems has recently kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in predicting spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message passing mechanism in GNNs limits the model's representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a cell-embedded GNN model (aka, CeGNN) to learn spatiotemporal dynamics with lifted performance. Specifically, we introduce a learnable cell attribution to the node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume to edge and then to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the performance of CeGNN and alleviate the over-smoothness problem, via treating the latent features as basis functions. The extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baseline models, significantly reducing the prediction errors on several PDE systems.",

In fact, there have been many breakthrough studies on both graph-based methods and other neural operator approaches in recent years [1].\n\n2. This work appears more like a straightforward extension of MP-PDE, both in terms of methodology and experiments. The paper proposes a cell-based method for extracting spatial relationships, but how much improvement could be observed if this feature were integrated into MP-PDE?\n\n3. The main experimental results are somewhat confusing. Since the code is not available, it is unclear whether the training data was generated from the authors' own simulations or from public datasets, and what the training dataset size is. If the data is self-generated, the comparison with a few simple baselines is not convincing. Furthermore, the authors mention long-term simulations, yet all experiments are based on one-step predictions, which is clearly insufficient.\n\n4. Regarding the core innovation of this paper, the cell feature is merely a learnable feature initialized by the distance to the cell center. Can its significance be verified by theoretical analysis or by measuring the distance between cell features and node features? The benefit here might simply be from adding position awareness, which makes the model fit specific data better. It could even be considered to replace the distance to the cell center with the distance to the nearest PDE boundary for each point, which might also yield improvements.\n\n[1] Wang, Haixin, et al. \"Recent Advances on Machine Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics: A Survey.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.12171 (2024)."
