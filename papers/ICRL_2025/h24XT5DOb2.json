    "title": "A Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring and Suicide Detection",
    "abstract": "Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited, particularly in areas requiring the analysis of smaller and more complex datasets. While foundation models have made significant advances in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. Wearable device datasets are inherently heterogeneous and multisource and often exhibit high rates of missing data, presenting unique challenges. Notably, missing patterns in these datasets are frequently not-at-random, and when adequately modeled, these patterns can reveal crucial insights into patient behavior. \nThis paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. Our model excels at reconstructing heterogeneous multisource time-series data and effectively models missing data patterns. We demonstrate that our pretrained model, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients with diverse mental health issues, can perform downstream tasks without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. This is illustrated through the use of a change-point detection algorithm that identifies suicide attempts with high accuracy, matching or surpassing patient-specific methods, thereby highlighting the potential of VQ-VAE as a versatile tool for behavioral analysis in healthcare.",

                "value": "W1. My primary concern regarding this paper is its technical novelty. Although the proposal adeptly uses the VQ-VAE model as the foundational framework, modifies its design to capture missing data patterns in time-series wearable device data, and connects to change-point detection as a downstream task, it relies heavily on existing techniques. This reliance diminishes the perceived novelty of the proposed model. Moreover, the paper does not sufficiently articulate the challenges and complexities associated with integrating these techniques, which is crucial for demonstrating its innovation.\n\nW2. The evaluation of imputation performance lacks comparative baselines, which undermines the robustness of the findings. Additionally, the downstream task evaluation includes only one baseline, HetMM, which is insufficient. Incorporating a broader range of advanced and recent baselines would help demonstrate the superiority of the proposal in this research area.\n\nW3. The evaluation relies solely on a single proprietary dataset, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the evaluation to include multiple datasets would enhance the credibility and applicability of the proposed model across different contexts.\n\nW4. The performance improvements offered by the proposed model are marginal when compared with HetMM. Given that the proposal claims advantages in scalability and efficiency, it is essential to substantiate these claims with experiments on larger datasets or real-time analysis scenarios.\n\nW5. As the proposal targets a specific healthcare application\u2014suicide detection\u2014it would be advantageous to include medical validation of the findings or to offer insights into how the proposed model could inform real-world clinical decision-making. Such contributions would significantly elevate the practical relevance of the proposal.\n\nW6. The writing of this paper could be improved by addressing the following aspects:\n\n(i) The paper should clearly identify which model among Model A0, Model A1, and Model A2 performs best and should be recognized as the final proposed model.\n\n(ii) The inclusion of a detailed related work section is necessary. This section would help situate the paper within the existing body of knowledge, providing a comprehensive backdrop against which the current research can be assessed and appreciated."

A more thorough investigation, possibly through qualitative analysis or correlations with clinically relevant features, would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions.\n\n- **Omission of Spatio-Temporal Architectures**: While the authors mention that exploring spatio-temporal architectures is left for future work, the choice not to use models such as GNNs, RNNs, or Transformers, which are well-suited for these types of tasks, is not sufficiently justified. This omission limits the model's applicability to more complex time series problems.\n\n- **Clarity in Results Presentation:** The presentation of results could be made clearer.

Why are these not also used during the calculation of the loss function to optimize their imputation, potentially improving the model\u2019s capacity to handle missing values in the time series?\n\n- What is the class imbalance in the Suicide Detection task? If there is significant imbalance, the AUC score might be misleading. In clinical settings, the AUPRC is often used as an alternative metric for imbalanced data [1]. Perhaps it could be considered for this problem as well.\n\n- The imputation errors in Table 6 seem quite high, although this may be due to the nature of the data. Could the authors provide results from comparison techniques? It would be useful to include at least one method of a common benchmark [2], and possibly show results from methods like linear interpolation and mean interpolation.\n\n- The paper mentions that these profile embeddings could enhance the interpretability of individual behaviors. Have the authors explored this? Were they able to find any correlation between the presence of specific embeddings and labels? If not, could they outline how they would approach this in future work, if it falls outside the scope of this paper?\n\n- Why were more suitable architectures for capturing spatio-temporal representations not used? While it is mentioned that this is left for future work, it\u2019s unclear why models such as GNNs, RNNs, Transformers, or even newer blocks like Mamba were not considered [2] [3].\n\n- Figure 4 is difficult to interpret in terms of the quality of imputations and reconstructions. It would be helpful to complement this with a table, similar to Table 6.\n\n\n[1] Moor, M., Rieck, B., Horn, M., Jutzeler, C. R., & Borgwardt, K. (2021).
