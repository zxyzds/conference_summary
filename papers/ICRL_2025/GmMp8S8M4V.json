    "title": "HiS4MAE: High-efficiency Segmentation of Subcellular Structure via Self-distillated Masked Autoencoder",
    "abstract": "The accurate identification of subcellular structures is crucial for understanding cellular functions. However, due to the varied morphology of different cells, conventional segmentation methods typically depend on a substantial collection of accurately labeled images of cell structures. The creation of such precise labels is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised method for segmenting subcellular structures, named HiS4MAE (High-efficiency Segmentation of Subcellular Structure via Self-distillated Masked Autoencoder). Leveraging an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE), we train the encoder using the masked image modeling (MIM) framework, followed by clustering the encoded high-dimensional features to achieve pixel-level segmentation of structures. We employ a self-distillation technique to accelerate the model's training process and propose an inference method that is less time-consuming. We also introduce a discrete codebook to assist the self-distillation process, enhancing the model's stability during training. When applied to a publicly available volumetric electron microscopy (VEM) dataset of primary mouse pancreatic islet $\\beta$ cells, HiS4MAE not only surpasses the state-of-the-art technique but also significantly reduces the time required for both training and inference.",

Why is HIS4MAE only presenting evaluations at k=4?\n   2. Subcellular structure is complex and extends far beyond just 4 major organelles. Since the authors have chosen to use k-means clustering for unsupervised segmentation, it should be straightforward to show if more clusters can correspond to finer-grained structures, e.g., the membrane sounding the granule/mitochondria. Even a qualitative segmentation map could be helpful.\n\n2. Inconsistencies in motivations and methodologies. Line 061-063 argues that k-means' initial center introduces instability in clustering results. Line 077-078 suggests using fixed cluster centers, but line 272-273 states the method uses cluster centers calculated from random samples. \n\n3. The expand and stride strategy is vaguely discussed. The \"linear and non-linear function\" on line 268 is not defined, and the strategy is not clearly explained.\n\n\n[1] Han, Hongqing, et al. \"Self-supervised voxel-level representation rediscovers subcellular structures in volume electron microscopy.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n[2] Xie, Ronald, et al. \"Maester: masked autoencoder guided segmentation at pixel resolution for accurate, self-supervised subcellular structure recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023."
