    "title": "A Benchmark Study For Limit Order Book (LOB) Models and Time Series Forecasting Models on LOB Data",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of deep learning models on limit order book (LOB) data. Our work makes four significant contributions: (i) We evaluate existing LOB models on a proprietary futures LOB dataset to examine the transferability of LOB model performance between various assets; (ii) We are the first to benchmark existing LOB models on the mid-price return forecasting (MPRF) task. (iii) We present the first benchmark study to evaluate SOTA time series forecasting models on the MPRF task to bridge the two fields of general-purpose time series forecasting and LOB time series forecasting; and (iv) we propose an architecture of convolutional cross-variate mixing layers (CVML) as an add-on to any deep learning multivariate time series model to significantly enhance MPRF performance on LOB data. Our empirical results highlight the value of our benchmark results on our proprietary futures LOB dataset, demonstrating a performance gap between the commonly used open-source stock LOB dataset and our futures dataset. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that LOB-aware model design is essential for achieving optimal prediction performance on LOB datasets. Most importantly, our results show that our proposed CVML architecture brings about an average improvement of 244.9% to various time series models\u2019 mid-price return forecasting performance.",

This paper is also easy to follow with enough details on the performance of the benchmarks."

                "value": "1: As a benchmark paper, although this paper provides lots of comparison methods and results. I feel like the datasets (2 datasets) selected for this study are not enough. LOB is based on different markets, which normally will have different kinds of results. The 2 datasets are from NASDAQ Nordic stock market and SC (Crude Oil), one of China\u2019s most liquid futures contracts. For papers that are mainly focusing on technical achievements, these might be enough datasets and experiments to showcase superior performance, but for benchmark papers, two markets are not enough. I would recommend adding more market datasets, such as Bitcoin Limit Order Book (LOB) Data, which has many public resources. \n\n2: I have questions on CVML, \n\n2.1 The authors claim that, CVML can be added on any deep learning multivariate time series model to significantly enhance MPRF performance on LOB data. However, in Table 6, the performance variances are really different, from 3.1% to 958.3%. I'm not sure if this can be called as \"can be added on any deep learning methods\". Also, there are only 4 methods. I think it's not safe to claim \"can be added on any deep learning methods\" with only 4 methods experiments. \n\n2.2 \"an average improvement of 244.9%\" is the conclusion on CVML form the authors. I don't understand how the authors calculate this average. Can you explain me how you make such calculation?"

The paper falls short in providing a detailed description of the unique challenges that LOB presents for time series prediction. It particularly lacks an articulation of these challenges in a way that informs the design of new LOB benchmarks,\n2. The paper lacks comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored for LOB data. For instance, beyond conventional statistical indicators such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Correlation (Corr), and R-squared (R\u00b2), there is a need for evaluation metrics or testing methods that better align with the characteristics of LOB data. This includes how to test the model's handling of LOB data features (e.g., high-frequency updates and noise issues), the complexity of market microstructure in LOB data, and insufficient testing of the model's robustness in the face of extreme market events.\n3. Despite the inclusion of futures data, the paper does not convincingly demonstrate the breadth and representativeness of the datasets used to cover various LOB scenarios, including foreign exchange and cryptocurrencies. A more robust justification is needed to explain how the selected datasets capture the range of challenges encountered in diverse LOB environments.\n4. The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing methods, which is essential for validating the proposed CVML approach within the LOB domain.
