    "title": "Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games",
    "abstract": "Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with a local $\\textit{linear}$ convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local $\\textit{superlinear}$ convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods do not offer convergence rate guarantees. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.",

In this paper, the authors study a problem related to this area, particularly an unconstrained two-player zero-sum game with an objective function that can be nonconvex-nonconcave. \n\nIn this direction they study algorithms for convergence to local Nash equilibria taking into account the second order conditions of the function. To do that they propose a dynamical systems approach s.t. under specific assumptions the critical points are also local Nash equilibria to the initial game. They prove that their initial dynamics converges with local linear rate of convergence to a local strict Nash equilibrium and they give an improved algorithm of them with super linear local rate of convergence. Finally, they give an algorithm for the constrained setting based on an Euclidean projection approach to converge to a local generalized Nash equilibrium and experiments to give evidence for their approach."

The author shows that the algorithm achieves local linear convergence and proposes an advanced version enabling superlinear convergence."

Compared to prior work that focused on local convergence to Nash equilibria in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization, the paper derives explicit rates of convergence, and also addresses the constrained setting as well. I believe that both of those contributions are important. The authors also support their theory by conducting several experiments, showing that the proposed method outperforms quite convincingly the two most related algorithms (LSS and CESP). Moreover, the paper employs interest techniques, mostly relying on dynamical system theory. Although most of those techniques are standard in this area, the way they are combined in this paper appears to be new. The writing overall is of high quality, and the authors do a good job at explaining the key ideas in the main body. The most related papers have been cited, although I would suggest including a more detailed discussion about the paper of Daskalakis et al. (2023) since it is strongly related. All claims appear to be sound."

First, the proposed method relies on second-order information, which could limit its practical applicability. Perhaps more importantly, the main result only establishes local convergence. It is unclear whether a local convergence guarantee is a strong enough solution concept. The paper of Daskalakis et al. (2023) provides a global convergence guarantee, but the latter comes without a rate of convergence. At the same time, I believe that computing local Nash equilibria in this setting is intractable (at least in the constrained setting), and so this perhaps justify focusing on local convergence. Regarding the assumptions made in the paper, Assumption 3 seems very artificial and hard to parse. Can the authors elaborate more on what that assumption entails? And why is it a reasonable assumption? Assumption 2 also seems somewhat artificial, but at least its role is quite clear. I believe that the main body should discuss in more detail some of those assumptions."
