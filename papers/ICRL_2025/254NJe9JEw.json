    "title": "A deep inverse-mapping model for a flapping robotic wing",
    "abstract": "In systems control, the dynamics of a system is governed by modulating its inputs to achieve a desired outcome. For example, to control the thrust of a quadcopter propeller the controller modulates its rotation rate, relying on a straightforward mapping between the input rotation rate and the resulting thrust. This mapping can be inverted to determine the rotation rate needed to generate a desired thrust. However, in complex systems, such as flapping-wing robots where intricate fluid motions are involved, mapping inputs (wing kinematics) to outcomes (aerodynamic forces) is nontrivial and inverting this mapping for real-time control is computationally impractical. Here, we report a machine-learning solution for the inverse-mapping of a flapping-wing system based on data from an experimental system we have developed. Our model learns the input wing motion required to generate a desired aerodynamic force outcome. We used a sequence-to-sequence model tailored for time-series data and augmented it with an adaptive-spectrum layer that implements representation learning in the frequency domain. To train our model, we developed a flapping-wing system that simultaneously measures the wing's aerodynamic force and its 3D motion using high-speed cameras. We demonstrate the performance of our system on an additional open-source dataset of a flapping wing in a different flow regime. Results show superior performance compared with more complex state-of-the-art transformer-based models, with 11% improvement on the test datasets. Our open-source data and framework may improve modeling and real-time control of systems governed by complex dynamics, from biomimetic robots to biomedical devices.",

Nevertheless, these paragraphs are clear. \n\nThere are many comparisons between different baseline methods, which is good. However, it would be beneficial to have a statistical test to show that the improvement in performance between Seq2Seq+ASL and the other baseline methods is statistically significant. In Figure 5, there is not that much difference between the Seq2Seq and Transformer models. A statistical test such as Mann Whitney U-test to compare the differences between the MAE losses. I leave the choice of statistical test to the authors discretion."

Is there a reason for not doing this?\n\nPlease could you point me to where you state the size of the dataset and evaluation sets used to compare results against the baselines.\n\nI have a further optional suggestion for authors. Can the authors comment on the frequency spectrum present in the data? \n\nThis question is more one of curiosity, but may be of interest to other readers: I have a question about the RFFT and the IRFFT. How do you implement this in practice? I had assumed that most \u201cfast\u201d implementations are non-differentiable and I am curious which implementation you used."

Empirical effects are provided in the results (although the improvement provided in Table 2 seems not very promising). The innovation is relatively weak. The theoretical principle and intuitive explanation behind the learning architecture should be further abstracted and discussed.\n\n2. The implemented experiments are relatively simple. The real applied scenarios are usually more complicated, such as external disturbance, unknown dynamic model, and actuator uncertainty. The generalization problem of the developed learning architecture is not considered.  To improve contributions, it is highly recommended to further include the learned inverse model in the online control framework, not just offline demonstration on the dataset of a flapping wing. Moreover, a comparison with a traditional control method (e.g., MPC) is needed.\n\n3. Some presentation errors. Every abbreviation that appears first in an article should be given its full name, such as FFT. All symbols employed in Fig 3 should be illustrated."

In real application, how to plan the desired force and how to implement the obtained attitude?  A special control framework can be provided to illustrate the implementation of the learned inverse model.
