    "abstract": "Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types.\n\nThis paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries.  \n \nThe proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. \n\nFor periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed the invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and detect thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's five largest databases in a few minutes on a modest desktop computer.",

                "value": "This is a new method for searching crystals. Multiple databases were used for evaluation.\n\nThe authors claim large improvements from years to hours.\n\nThe paper does make some large claims. For example, in the abstract there is a free standing claim saying\n\"The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any\ndata objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces.\" This is for some types of\nneural networks not for all algorithms. Correct? Please clarify by providing evidence or citations supporting the claim that this is an \"essential requirement\" for all ML on ambiguous data in continuous spaces. Alternatively, please clarify if this applies only to certain types of ML algorithms. \n\nThe paper is written for an extremely specialized and narrowly focused domain and not for the general \nML crowds found in ICLR.\n\nThe authors will need to add more explanations for general purpose ICLR audience. Otherwise this paper should be submitted to a Crystallography journal.\n\nThe main contribution is that the authors can  convert any PDD{h} into a fixed-size matrix,\nwhich can be flattened into a vector for easy comparisons, while keeping the continuity and almost\nall invariant data.\n\nThe authors also directly talk to the reviewers which is unexpected. For example, \"We thank all reviewers for supporting scientific integrity, now guaranteed by the proposed invariants.\" or \"Thank you for reading all the proofs!\". Such claims are informal and not relevant for a publication in ICLR."

In particular the representation is Lipschitz-continuous under noise, i.e., tiny variations of crystal structures, e.g. caused by measurement noise, only yield tiny distances in representation space. The representation allows the efficient identification of duplicates or (noisy) near-duplicates in databases by pairwise comparisons in databases with in total almost two million entries, thus revealing a large number of previously unknown duplicates as well as labelling errors (same structure with different chemical composition, which is infeasible) in the databases. Last but not least, the proposed approach is able to distinguish all known counter-examples, i.e. examples indistinguishable by some previous representations."
