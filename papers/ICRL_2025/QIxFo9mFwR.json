    "title": "Scale-aware Recognition in Satellite Images under Resource Constraints",
    "abstract": "Recognition of features in satellite imagery (forests, swimming pools, etc.) depends strongly on the spatial scale of the concept and therefore the resolution of the images. This poses two challenges:\nWhich resolution is best suited for recognizing a given concept, and where and when should the costlier higher-resolution (HR) imagery be acquired? \nWe present a novel scheme to address these challenges by introducing three components: (1) A technique to  distill knowledge from models trained on HR imagery to recognition models that operate on imagery of lower resolution (LR), (2) a sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement, and (3) an LLM-based approach for inferring concept \"scale\". With these components we present a system to efficiently perform scale-aware recognition in satellite imagery, improving accuracy over single-scale inference while following budget constraints. **Our novel approach offers up to a 26.3\\% improvement over entirely HR baselines, using 76.3 \\% fewer HR images.**",

The main contributions are: (1)knowledge distillation is adopted to allow Low resolution models to improve significantly in  recognizing finer concepts by learning from High resolution ones. (2) Semantic understanding of LLM is used to determine the  scale of each concept.(3) A sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement is proposed. The process is frameworked as remote sensing image retrieval task. Experiments show some promising success for the proposed idea.\nThe idea is very novel and interesting."

If the recognition results differ significantly, HR images could be invoked. What are the advantages of the proposed, more complex method over this approach?\n\nImpact of resolution ratio on the proposed method is suggested to be discussed.

Is using LLM-based in-context learning to determine the scale reliable? Has the accuracy been tested on unseen categories in the validation set? Since the context is determined by the HR and LR scores, why not directly train a network using the HR and LR scores? It is well known that LLMs are very resource-intensive, and using an LLM just to determine the scale seems like overkill. Furthermore, it contradicts the premise of resource efficiency\u2014if one cannot afford HR images, they likely don't have the computational resources to run an LLM either."
