    "title": "Transformer-Based CT Anomaly Detection and Auto-Segmentation of Sparse Lung Nodules",
    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of lung nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans is challenging due to extreme class imbalance, where nodules appear sparsely among healthy tissue. Lung tumor boards often review these scans manually, a time-consuming process. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach for lung tumor segmentation by framing the problem as anomaly detection. The method is divided into two stages, allowing each model to leverage its strengths. Stage 1 focuses on region proposal, employing a custom Deformable Detection Transformer with Focal Loss to overcome class imbalance and localize sparse tumors. In Stage 2, the predicted bounding boxes are refined into pixel-wise segmentation masks using a fine-tuned variant of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation. To address the challenge of nodule sparsity and improve spatial context, a 7.5 mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is applied, aiding in the differentiation between nodules, bronchioles, and vascular structures. The model achieves a Dice coefficient of 92.4%, with 95.2% sensitivity and 93.2% precision on the LUNA16 dataset, demonstrating robust performance in real-world clinical conditions where nodule sparsity is 5%.",

I think the paper fall short in showing how these individual components are fundamentally innovated upon rather than simply integrated. Without clear evidence of novel adaptations or improvements to each component, the approach might seem like an assemblage of established methods rather than a groundbreaking technique\n- although model achieves strong results on a modified version of the LUNA16 dataset, its robustness in diverse real-world settings is uncertain. Validating the approach on additional lung datasets could reinforce its practical impact and help mitigate concerns of overfitting to a single dataset\n- paper introduces encoding and decoding processes using Deformable-DETR and SAM yet it lacks a detailed mathematical explanation of how refined feature maps are encoded and subsequently reconstructed. Without mathematical formulations and a proof of concept, it remains unclear how effectively the feature maps capture and retain essential characteristics through the two stages"
