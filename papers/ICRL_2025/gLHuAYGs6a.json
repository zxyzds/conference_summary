    "title": "Structural Multi-view Clustering Network via Heterogeneous Random Walks",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering, which aims to partition data samples into disjoint clusters by leveraging information from multiple views, has been shown to be highly effective when incorporating structure information, as widely acknowledged in recent works. This paper presents a novel structural multi-view clustering network via heterogeneous random walks, guided by a unified sample-level structure to enhance clustering performance. We first construct a multi-view heterogeneous graph consisting of sample nodes and view nodes, capturing correlations between views while preserving their specific structures. Then, a multi-step random walk strategy on the heterogeneous graph is introduced to explore high-order sample structures across various views, ensuring that each view structure is taken into account. Based on this, a lightweight network is designed to facilitate structure learning both within-view and cross-view, guided by the unified structure derived from heterogeneous random walks, ultimately achieving representations that are conducive to clustering. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

The framework and training strategy of the proposed method are the same as those of DIVIDE.\n2. [Soundness] The advantage and effectiveness of the proposed heterogeneous graph (which is the main contribution of this paper) are not clearly presented and demonstrated. The authors only show the effectiveness in an ablation study (Table 3), but this is not sufficient for showing its effectiveness. I would suggest the author to deeply analyze and discuss why it works and how it works.\n3. [Motivation] The motivation is not clearly presented, e.g., why they propose the heterogeneous graph, what's the difference between introducing node samples for interaction among views and directly learning among views?\n4. [Presentation] The organization of this paper is not good, especially the Methods section. For example, the matrix $M$ is defined two times,\"the transition matrix M of v-th view is obtained by normalizing the adjacency matrix A in a row-wise manner\" and Eq.(10). The author should formally define it when it first appear. $T$ is not clearly defined, what's it value range?\n5. [Presentation] Contribution is not clear. The authors referred to many designs from DIVIDE, what's the main novel and main contribution of this paper?"

Mixing the random walk process from multiple views has been studied in \u201cSpectral Clustering and Transductive Learning with Multiple Views.\u201d (Zhou et al., 2017)\n2.\tThe methodology in this work bears substantial similarities to the DIVIDE method in \u201cDecoupled Contrastive Multi-View Clustering with High-Order Random Walks\u201d. (Lu et al., 2024) The random walk-based proximity measure, model architecture and loss functions in SMvCNet largely follow from DIVIDE. There is one noticeable difference, that the heterogeneous random walk is adopted instead of each view\u2019s own random walk transition matrix. Hence, the novelty of this work should be clarified.\n3.\tThe presentation of the SMvCNet clustering method should be more complete.  In Figure 2, \u201cMomentum encoder\u201d modules and \u201cMoving average\u201d procedures are never addressed in the text. The paper also does not explain how the final clustering results are acquired.\n4.\tGiven the wide range of multi-view datasets, the experiment results could be strengthened by including more data. Especially, the number of views here is rather small, on average 2.8."

What is the computational complexity of this clustering method? Are there empirical results of clustering efficiency against the baseline methods? Is the edge pruning technique in 4.7 effective for improving efficiency?\n2.\tIn the paper \u201cDecoupled Contrastive Multi-View Clustering with High-Order Random Walks\u201d (Lu et al., 2024) the ACC/NMI/ARI results on the complete Scene15 dataset are 0.491, 0.487, 0.316, respectively. However, the metrics reported here are much lower (0.431, 0.435, 0.259). ACCMVC\u2019s results on the Prokaryotic dataset are also much lower than those reported in their original paper.\n3.\tMore recent works on multi-view clustering could be compared and discussed. For example, \u201cCross-view Topology Based Consistent and Complementary Information for Deep Multi-view Clustering\u201d (Dong et al., 2023) also reports competitive results on the UCI-Digit dataset."
