    "abstract": "Generating street-view images from satellite imagery is a challenging task, particularly in maintaining accurate pose alignment and incorporating diverse environmental conditions. While diffusion models have shown promise in generative tasks, their ability to maintain strict pose alignment throughout the diffusion process is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Iterative Homography Adjustment (IHA) scheme applied during the denoising process, which effectively addresses pose misalignment and ensures spatial consistency in the generated street-view images. Additionally, currently, available datasets for satellite-to-street-view generation are limited in their diversity of illumination and weather conditions, thereby restricting the generalizability of the generated outputs. To mitigate this, we introduce a text-guided illumination and weather-controlled sampling strategy that enables fine-grained control over the environmental factors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves pose accuracy and enhances the diversity and realism of generated street-view images, setting a new benchmark for satellite-to-street-view generation tasks.",

                "value": "The paper clearly defines the problem by identifying two key challenges in Satellite-to-Street-View Synthesis: geometric consistency and environmental diversity. It effectively addresses these challenges by proposing corresponding solutions.\n\nThe innovative Iterative Homography Adjustment scheme stands out as a significant contribution. By iteratively refining the intermediate output based on relative pose differences, this approach corrects pose misalignments. I believe the \"iterative adjustment\" mechanism not only plays a crucial role in the Satellite-to-Street-View Synthesis task but also holds potential for broader applications in other controllable image synthesis tasks.\n\nThe introduction of the Zero-Shot Environmental Control (ZoEC) mechanism is another noteworthy highlight. Compared to existing methods like ControlNet, ZoEC demonstrates superior performance in synthesizing environmental variations through text-based control, enhancing the flexibility and realism of the generated outputs.\n\nThe paper is well-written and well-structured, making it easy to follow and understand. The clarity of presentation further strengthens the overall impact of the work."

Understanding the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency would enhance the practical value of the method.\n\nThe paper lacks an ablation study on the proposed Geometric Cross-Attention (GCA) mechanism. Including this analysis would help isolate and highlight the specific contribution of GCA to the overall performance.\n\nWhile the rationale for introducing a new evaluation metric is understandable, for a fair comparison, it is important to also report results using the evaluation pipeline and metrics from previous works, such as RMSE, PSNR, and SD. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's performance relative to existing approaches.\n\nThe scholarship could be improved by referencing other relevant works in conditional street-view synthesis, such as SCP-Diff: Photo-Realistic Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatial-Categorical Joint Prior [ECCV 2024]. This would situate the proposed method more effectively within the broader research landscape."

Besides, it is recommended for the authors to provide more details for the meaning of the derived results. What benefits does this derivation bring to subsequent model design? How do model design and formula derivation relate to each other?\n\n2. In Method, the proposed \u201cCROSS-VIEW CONDITIONING MECHANISM\u201d injects the controlling information into the diffusion model. Actually, it is like to introduce a query to extract the features from the satellite image. However, the authors\u2019 statement makes me a little confused. Firstly, the authors state that \\mathbf{A} represents the confidence. \\delta{h} represents the height offset, but there is no evidence shown here. If they are indeed what the author says they are, at least some visualization should be displayed or some reasons should be explained. Besides, the detail of sampling operation should be given. Secondly, this module is named Geometric Cross-Attention (GCA), but there is no \u2018attention\u2019 mechanism here, equation (7) even does not contain a softmax symbol. Thirdly, what is the benefit of this mechanism brings as compared to the naive cross-attention? \n\n3. In \u201cITERATIVE POSE ALIGNMENT DURING INFERENCE\u201d, equation (8) and Line-277 also have the sampling operation defined in Line-251, please elaborate it. Why the symbol in equation (8) is different in Line-273? \n\n4. In \u201cTEXT-GUIDED ZERO-SHOT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL\u201d, why choosing \u201c\\epsilon\u201d to controlling the generative precess with respect\tto text prompt? It is weird for \u201cpotent satellite image prompts significantly undermine the influence of text prompts during training\u201d. Have you applied the CFG scheme?"
