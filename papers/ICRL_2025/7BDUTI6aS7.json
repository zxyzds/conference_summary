    "title": "Risk Quadrangle and Robust Optimization Based on $\\varphi$-Divergence",
    "abstract": "The Fundamental Risk Quadrangle (FRQ) is a unified framework linking risk management, statistical estimation, and optimization. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based on $\\varphi$-divergence minimizes the maximal expected loss, where the maximum is over a $\\varphi$-divergence uncertainty set. This paper introduces the \\emph{extended} $\\varphi$-divergence and the extended $\\varphi$-divergence quadrangle, which integrates DRO into the FRQ framework. We derive the primal and dual representations of the quadrangle elements (risk, deviation, regret, error, and statistic). The dual representation provides an interpretation of classification, portfolio optimization, and regression as robust optimization based on the extended $\\varphi$-divergence. The primal representation offers tractable formulations of these robust optimizations as convex optimization. We provide illustrative examples showing that many common problems, such as least-squares regression, quantile regression, support vector machines, and CVaR optimization, fall within this framework. Additionally, we conduct a case study to visualize the optimal solution of the inner maximization in robust optimization.",

                "value": "# **Confusing Organization**\nThe paper\u2019s organization makes it challenging to follow, especially for a theoretically-oriented work. Significant revisions would improve clarity and accessibility for a broader ML audience:\n\n-\t**Length, Example-Driven Intro**: The first three pages focus heavily on two examples, with numerous mathematical formulas, but lack emphasis on the paper\u2019s main contribution. The connections between the mean, quantile, and extended $\\phi$-divergence quadrangle only become apprante after multiple readings, which detracts from the paper utility.\n\n-\t**Overly Technical Sections**: Secs 2 and 3 are highly technical without sufficient explanatory context. Some definitions, such as Defs 2.2., 2.3, 2.4, are only referenced once in Def 2.5 and are not essential to the main context. Moving these, along with Sec 2.3 to Appendix, would better suit a general ML audience.\n\n\n-\t**Lack of Cohesion between Sections**: Many disjointed sections create a fragmented flow. Consider reorganizing the technical results by grouping related content (e.g. combining primal-dual discussions in Secs 3 and 4 and merging Secs 5 and 6 to illustrate concrete cost function examples).\n\n-\t**Insufficient Explanation of Theorems**: Each theorem would benefit from non-technical explanations to help readers understand its meaning and implications. Currently, the lack of such interpretations makes it difficult to grasp the practical relevance of the results. For instance, the purpose and utility of Propositions 7.1, 7.2, and 8.1 are unclear from a practical standpoint\u2014why and when would these results matter?\n\n# Unclear Contribution \nThe paper\u2019s contributions, particularly in the examples and novel interpretations, are difficult to discern: \n\n-\t**Ambiguity in Examples**: It\u2019s unclear what new insights the introductory examples provide. Established methods like CVaR-DRO (Example 3 in [1]) and chi-squared divergence DRO (Proposition 1 in [2]) already use duality forms, such as equations (1.14)\u2013(1.17) and (1.2)\u2013(1.5) being special examples. While the least squares and quantile regression examples appear novel, they lack clear interpretation. A discussion of how the robust model framework alters our perspective on these standard regressions and other cost functions would clarify the framework\u2019s value (e.g., a new perspective?).\n\n-\t**New interpretations in Sec 6**: The interpretation in Section 4 results are unclear. Much of this material appears to be standard in DRO literature or from standard DRO duality, and the equivalence in equations (6.4)\u2013(6.6) is not sufficiently justified. In terms of examples, Specifically, terms $R_{\\phi, \\beta}$ in (6.4), (6.7), (6.10) are not clearly explained. If these are defined based on Sec 3, should\u2019t they follow directly from the Definition 3.1? Besides, I am struggling to find the connections between this and the risk quadrangle framework. If the intent is to show this framework is more general, then the authors should provide concrete examples illustrating this generality and explain why aspects like negative $Q$ values are important.\n# General Comments\n-\t**Suitability for ICLR**: Given its current form, I am uncertain about this paper\u2019s suitability for an ML-focused conference like ICLR. The risk quadrangle framework may be too theoretical for a general ML audience, and the connection to robust optimization is unclear in terms of practical ML relevance.\n-\t**Notations**: The paper\u2019s notation can be streamlined. For example, similar terms like $Q_{\\phi, \\beta}^R$ (Line 39), $Q_{\\phi, \\beta}^V$ (line 104), $Q_{\\phi,\\beta}$ (Lie 288) represent similar concept. A unified notation would improve readability.\n\nReference:\n[1] John Duchi, Hongseok Namkoong. Learning Models with Uniform Performance via DRO. Annals of Statistics. 2020.\n[2] Henry Lam.

In particular, line 318-319, What do they mean by \"$Q$ is the Radon-Nikodym derivate $dP_0/dP$\"? In particular, what are the distributions $P$ and $P_0$ in this case? It seems to me that for the condition $\\mathbb{E}[\\varphi(Q)] \\leq \\beta$ to be expressed as $D_\\varphi(P ||\u00a0P_0) \\leq \\beta$ we would need Q to be distributed according to $P_0$.\n\n- Are the examples presented in the introduction well-known in the literature?
