    "title": "FourierMamba: Fourier Learning Integration with State Space Models for Image Deraining",
    "abstract": "Image deraining aims to remove rain streaks from rainy images and restore clear backgrounds. Currently, some research that employs the Fourier transform has proved to be effective for image deraining, due to it acting as an effective frequency prior for capturing rain streaks. However, despite there exists dependency of low frequency and high frequency in images, these Fourier-based methods rarely exploit the correlation of different frequencies for conjuncting their learning procedures, limiting the full utilization of frequency information for image deraining. Alternatively, the recently emerged Mamba technique depicts its effectiveness and efficiency for modeling correlation in various domains (e.g., spatial, temporal), and we argue that introducing Mamba into its unexplored Fourier spaces to correlate different frequencies would help improve image deraining. This motivates us to propose a new framework termed FourierMamba, which performs image deraining with Mamba in the Fourier space. Owing to the unique arrangement of frequency orders in Fourier space, the core of FourierMamba lies in the scanning encoding of different frequencies, where the low-high frequency order formats exhibit differently in the spatial dimension  (unarranged in axis) and channel dimension (arranged in axis). Therefore, we design FourierMamba that correlates Fourier space information in the spatial and channel dimensions with distinct designs. Specifically, in the spatial dimension Fourier space, we introduce the zigzag coding to scan the frequencies to rearrange the orders from low to high frequencies,  thereby orderly correlating the connections between frequencies; in the channel dimension  Fourier space with arranged orders of frequencies in axis, we can directly use Mamba to perform frequency correlation and improve the channel information representation. Extensive experiments reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Moreover, the idea of interactions between frequencies is already implemented in Fourmer via convolutions.\n3.\tThe authors replace mamba with 1x1 conv for the first ablation studies. However, the flops or parameter comparisons are not provided. Is it possible that the improvement of mamba versions is derived from the additional computation overhead compared to the 1x1 conv version?\n4.\tRegarding the experimental results, the paper only provides results on four datasets in Tab.1, lacking the test100 dataset. Moreover, the competitors in Fig.6 are a little outdated. From my side, the experiments are insufficient. Specifically, compared to other mamba-based methods, the evaluation data/tasks are fewer. Compared to other deraining methods like drsformer, the authors adopt only a rain13 dataset plus spad for evaluation, which is also insufficient."

It is better to discuss more about wavelet transformation and Fourier transformation in dealing with frequencies. Besides, as shown in Table 1, the performance of (Zhen et al., 2024) is close to the proposed method on several datasets, but the comparison with this method on SPA-Data is missing.\n\n- The quantitative comparison is conducted with respect to PSNR and SSIM.

It would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent methods (post-2022) and provide additional zoomed-in patches or error maps to better highlight performance differences.\n\nThere are several confusing typographical issues, such as \"FCS\" being used as the abbreviation for \"Fourier Channel Evolution\" and \"C-FFT\" lacking a clear explanation (possibly referring to \"channel FFT\"). These should be clarified.\n\nFurthermore, the paper overlooks several closely related works, including:\n[1] Wavelet Approximation-Aware Residual Network for Single Image Deraining, 2023.\n[2] A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Network for Single Image Deraining, 2024.\n[3] Image Deraining with Frequency-Enhanced State Space Model, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, applying the L1 norm directly in the frequency domain may be less accurate than alternative metrics, such as coherence-based distances. An ablation study on the impact of different frequency-domain loss functions would strengthen the analysis.\n\nFinally, the zigzag scanning strategy appears intuitive for other low-level vision tasks, such as deblurring.

A more thorough discussion of the implementation and its impact on inference speed would strengthen the work.\n\n**Generalization to Other Tasks**:\nGiven that the motivation for zigzag scanning is not specific to rain removal, it would be valuable to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on other low-level vision tasks.
