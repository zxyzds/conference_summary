    "title": "An $O(k\\log n)$ Time Fourier Set Query Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Fourier transformation is an extensively studied problem in many research fields. It has many applications in machine learning, signal processing, compressed sensing, and so on. In many real-world applications, approximated Fourier transformation is sufficient and we only need to do the Fourier transform on a subset of coordinates. \nGiven a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}$, approximation parameters $\\epsilon, \\delta \\in (0, 0.1)$, and a query set $S \\subset [n]$ of size $k$, we propose an algorithm to compute an approximate Fourier transform result $x'$ which uses $O(\\epsilon^{-1} k \\log(n/\\delta))$ Fourier measurements and runs in $O(\\epsilon^{-1} k \\log(n/\\delta))$ time. For $\\hat{x}$ being the Fourier transformation result, our algorithm can output a vector $x'$ such that $\\\\| ( x' - \\widehat{x} )\\_S  \\\\|\\_2^2 \\leq \\epsilon \\\\| \\widehat{x}\\_{\\overline{S}} \\\\|\\_2^2 + \\delta \\\\| \\widehat{x} \\\\|\\_1^2 $ holds with probability of at least $9/10$, where $\\overline{S}$ denotes the complement of the set $S$, i.e., $\\overline{S} := [n] \\setminus S$.",

                "value": "This paper studies the Fourier set query problem: given a set of indices $S \\subset [n]$ and a vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^n$, the goal is to compute the Fourier transform $\\widehat{x}$ of $x$ at the set of indices $S$ with precision specified by parameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. More formally, the algorithm is required to output a vector $x'$ such that $$|| (x' - \\widehat{x})_S ||^2_2 \\leq \\epsilon ||\\widehat{x}_S||^2_2 + \\delta || \\widehat{x} ||^2_1. $$\n\nSince the complete Fourier transform can be computed in time $O(n \\log n)$, it is desired that the running time of the algorithm would be less than this. At the same time, for some applications the sample complexity, i.e. the number of entries in $x$ that are read by the algorithm, is also crucial.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is an algorithm that solves the Fourier set query problem with time and sample complexity $O(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon} \\log n)$, achieving an improvement over previous work."

                "value": "The greatest weakness of the paper is the lack of clarity, which greatly impedes assesment of its other merits. Some of the concerns are:\n\n1. This paper uses a lot of prior work, and it is not made clear what the improvements in techniques are, or sometimes what even are the techniques. For example, in section 4 the paragraphs discussing techniques 3 and 4 consist mainly of an outline of the proof. Concrete techniques are not highlighted, and it is hard to understand which steps are standard  in the literature, and which ones are the contribution of the paper.\nAs far as I am aware, the only thing stated as original contribution is the algorithm itself and the technique 2.\n\nI think that the paper should be rewritten in a way such that the key critical insights that led to the improvement of the algorithm become identifiable. My suggestions are \n - Extract the techniques 2 and 3 from the proof structure to show what do they allow you to do, preferably by formatting them as a lemma or a theorem. Otherwise, do not call those paragraphs \"techniques\", just a \"proof overview\".\n - For techniques 2 and 3, explicitly mention if the proof steps are an entirely novel contribution, and if not list works where they were borrowed from and discuss how your use of them is different from prior work.\n2. Explanation of how the algorithm or proofs work is lacking intuition. The majority of the paper, starting from section 3, is made up of dry and formal derivation of the main result. \nI would suggest:\n - Adding informal but detailed explanations of what each section does at its start, starting with section 3.\n - Add brief \"intuition paragraphs\" after each major theorem or lemma to explain its significance in plain language\n\nAs a consequence, in my opinion the significance of this paper in its current state is rather low. While the claimed result appears to be interesting, I doubt that the paper itself right now would of use for anyone, as it is very difficult to understand."

In my opinion, it is a step in the right direction, but it does not resolve the concerns that I have raised back then about the readability of the paper.\nIn the rebuttal for the previous conference, the authors also mentioned in their reply specific steps that they would take to improve the readability, which have been partially implemented in Section 4. I think that doing the rest of them will be greatly beneficial for the state of the paper."

From the manuscript, I wasn\u2019t able to follow the reasoning to convince myself that the manuscript is technically correct. \n\n- The manuscript is poorly written in my opinion. Having informal versions of many of the lemmas is not very helpful. Instead, it would have been better if the manuscript used that space to explain the many technical contribution of the manuscript. \n\n- I really wished the manuscript had a few sentences about the motivational applications. I am used to sparse Fourier problem, where the query set S is not known in advance, and the algorithm is designed to get both a set S (with |S|=k) and the Fourier modes in S. In that setting, the Hassanieh et. al paper from 2012 takes O(k*log(n)*log(n/k)) in samples and running time. It is also a deterministic algorithm. Query set Fourier, on the other hand, is limited to retrieving specified frequencies without leveraging the full sparsity of the signal."
