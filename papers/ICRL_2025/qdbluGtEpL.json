    "title": "Attack as Defense: Run-time Backdoor Implantation for Image Content Protection",
    "abstract": "As generative models achieve great success, tampering and modifying the sensitive image contents (i.e., human faces, artist signatures, commercial logos, etc.) have induced a significant threat with social impact. \nThe backdoor attack is a method that implants vulnerabilities in a target model, which can be activated through a trigger.\nIn this work, we innovatively prevent the abuse of image content modification by implanting the backdoor into image-editing models. Once the protected sensitive content on an image is modified by an editing model, the backdoor will be triggered, making the editing fail. \nUnlike traditional backdoor attacks that use data poisoning, to enable protection on individual images and eliminate the need for model training, we developed the first framework for run-time backdoor implantation, which is both time- and resource- efficient. We generate imperceptible perturbations on the images to inject the backdoor and define the protected area as the only backdoor trigger. Editing other unprotected insensitive areas will not trigger the backdoor, which minimizes the negative impact on legal image modifications. Evaluations with state-of-the-art image editing models show that our protective method can increase the CLIP-FID of generated images from 12.72 to 39.91, or reduce the SSIM from 0.503 to 0.167 when subjected to malicious editing. At the same time, our method exhibits minimal impact on benign editing, which demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed framework. The proposed run-time backdoor can also achieve effective protection on the latest diffusion models.",

                "value": "This paper presents a method for image content protection by implanting run-time backdoors in image-editing models and triggering the backdoors when sensitive content on an image is modified by an image-editing model. The triggered backdoor will then stop the editing from happening. The backdoors are injected via imperceptible perturbations on the images and the protected sensitive area in an image can be defined to trigger the backdoor.

                "value": "1. Trade-off between perturbation visibility and anti-editing effectiveness: While increasing the strength of the protective noise improves anti-editing performance, it also introduces noticeable pixel-level changes, which can degrade the visual quality of the image. This trade-off suggests that ensuring strong protection may be challenging without compromising user experience due to the visibility of the perturbation.\n2. Dependence on specific trigger regions: The effectiveness of this method relies on designated trigger regions, meaning the backdoor protection only activates when these specific areas are edited. If malicious editing avoids these regions, the protection mechanism may not be effective, limiting the flexibility and applicability of the approach. The region-trigger mechanism also provides attackers with the possibility to evade detection.\n3. Limited applicability to diffusion models: Although the method performs well in convolutional and Transformer models, it is less effective in diffusion models (e.g., LDM), especially when the perturbation strength is low, as the protection mechanism may fail. The denoising process in diffusion models tends to neutralize the protective noise, reducing the effectiveness of the approach in these types of models. It is recommended to increase the experiments on other types of generative models (such as GAN or VAE) to further verify the versatility of the method. At the same time, conduct more in-depth experiments on the diffusion model to optimize the perturbation or trigger mechanism and enhance the protection effect."

If the user adopts an inpainting model different from the one used by the defender to perform the backdoor, does this mean that the protective method proposed in this paper will become ineffective? In other words, the transferability of protective backdoors (handling unknown inpainting models) and scenarios where the inpainting model is a black box should be discussed.\n- Secondly, this paper only involves inpainting methods based on learning (such as inpainting models based on GANs or Diffusion) and lacks an evaluation of traditional image editing techniques. For instance, what results would occur when using software like Photoshop to edit regions protected by the method proposed?\n\nRelated Work:\n- While the proposed method is based on the concept of backdoors, it is similar to image immunization in active defense strategies. Therefore, I believe that including a comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses between the proposed method and active defense algorithms (such as [1*, 2*]) would enhance the quality of this paper. Furthermore, in the experimental section, these active defense algorithms could be used as baselines for comparison.\n\n[1*] \u201cEditguard: Versatile image watermarking for tamper localization and copyright protection\u201d in CVPR\u201924.\n\n[2*] \u201cDraw: Defending camera-shooted raw against image manipulation\u201d in CVPR\u201923.\n\nExperiments:\n- In Sec. 4.2, although the proposed method leads to significant quality degradation when editing the protected region, its impact on areas outside the protected region cannot be overlooked. As shown in the last row of Table 1, for the \"watermark\" data in the \"w/o\" case, there can be a PSNR difference of up to 5.64 or 4.69 (in LaMa and MAT, respectively). For other types of data, there are also PSNR differences ranging from 1.21 to 1.91. This substantial difference contradicts the author's statement of being \"minimal\" (line 416). Therefore, I believe that the proposed method lacks practical feasibility.\n- There is a lack of robustness experiments against post-processing. While the authors mention in line 519 that the method can resist operations like cropping and scaling, I could not find relevant results supporting this claim, including in Appendix D. This absence of evidence regarding the robustness of the method against post-processing operations is a significant limitation that should be addressed.\n\nPresentation: This document contains many careless writing errors and lacks proofreading (e.g. inappropriate use of left brackets), especially in the appendix.\n- Line 148: \u201cPrevious works( ?\u201d\n- Line 809: \u201cfigure ??\u201d\n- Line 832: \u201cLaM( Suvorov et al.
