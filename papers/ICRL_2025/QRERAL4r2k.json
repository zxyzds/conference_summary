    "title": "HuMouS: Human Motion Synthesis with Fine-Grained Control using Latent Space Manipulation of Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of spatially guided text-to-motion synthesis. While there has been work to incorporate spatial constraints in text-to-motion diffusion models, existing methods still face significant challenges in generating motions that align with the conditional controls. To this end, we propose Cycle Consistent Diffusion, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing frame-level cycle consistency between generated motions and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we ensure that the output motion and the input spatial constraint are forced to be consistent. A straightforward implementation though consistent with the input often does not match fine-grained control signals. To this end, we introduce a novel test-time optimization framework that directs our pre-trained cycle consistent diffusion model towards user-defined sparse constraints. We demonstrate approximately 5 to 10 percent improvement in controllability of motion synthesis on the HumanML3D dataset, while significantly reducing foot skating artifacts.",

                "value": "This work is trying to address the problem of motion generation with spatial control. It proposes a cycle consistency loss when training the diffusion model with spatial conditions. This is achieved by extracting the spatial control signal from the diffusion prediction and forcing an alignment with the input condition spatial signal. Furthermore, it proposes to optimize the latent noise of the diffusion model using the DDIM solver to ensure the precision of the spatial control at test time."

The technical novelty is relatively limited. \n    1) A spatial condition motion diffusion model is very straightforward and has been seen in previous work [1]. \n    2) The cycle consistency training is very similar to the method used in image generation [2], which is easy to inject into the motion diffusion model without a specific design. I don't think it introduces much insight to the motion generation community.\n    3) Optimizing the diffusion noise has been seen in previous work [3]. The modification is rather incremental. More analysis is needed to demonstrate the design of special DDIM inversion initialization and regularization. \n2. There only limited video results are for me to evaluate the quality of the generated motion. More visual results compared with the SOTA methods are helpful for evaluation. \n\n[1] Yiming Xie, Varun Jampani, Lei Zhong, Deqing Sun, and Huaizu Jiang.

The qualitative results are not comprehensive.  It is not easy to observe the improvement beyond DNO and Omnicontrol in the provided images. In addition, the presented figures do not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. The ablation study reveals that incorporating all proposed components does not yield optimal performance across all metrics. Instead, the absence of certain components leads to better performance on some metrics. This raises concerns about whether the performance improvements stem from parameter tuning rather than the effectiveness of the proposed components.\n4. The experimental evaluation is insufficient. The experiments are conducted on only a single dataset, lacking cross-dataset validation on other relevant datasets such as the KIT-ML dataset. Moreover, the comparison is limited to only two baseline methods, which is inadequate compared to comprehensive evaluations like those in Omnicontrol which include multiple comparative approaches.\n5.
