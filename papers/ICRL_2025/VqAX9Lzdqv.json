    "title": "Enhancing Interpretability in Deep Reinforcement Learning through Semantic Clustering",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore semantic clustering properties of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve its interpretability and deepen our understanding of the internal semantic organization. In this context, semantic clustering refers to the ability of neural networks to cluster inputs based on their semantic similarity in the internal space. We propose a DRL architecture that incorporates a novel semantic clustering module, which includes both feature dimensionality reduction and online clustering. This module integrates seamlessly into the DRL training pipeline, addressing the instability of t-SNE and eliminating the need for extensive manual annotation in the previous semantic analysis methods. Through experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed module and demonstrate its ability to reveal semantic clustering properties within DRL. Furthermore, we introduce new analytical methods that leverage these properties to provide insights into the hierarchical structure of policies and the semantic organization within the feature space. These methods also help identify potential risks within the model, offering a deeper understanding of its limitations and guiding future improvements.",

However, in RL scenarios, minor state variations can lead to significant changes in optimal decisions. How does the proposed method address this issue to ensure meaningful clustering?\n2.\tIn Line 221, what specifically does \"online training\" refer to? Could you clarify whether this pertains to training the clustering module concurrently with the DRL model or another process?\n3.\tSince the method aims to interpret DRL by clustering state inputs, why not directly use the DRL output as the clustering input? Intuitively, if different states yield similar DRL outputs, they might be more likely to be semantically similar."

                "value": "- In the \"Background\" paragraph of Section 3, the explanation of Vector Quantized VAEs feels very out of place. A more subtle introduction to VQ is needed. More specifically, at this point in the paper, it is not clear why the audience needs to know about VQ-VAEs. There is no context for it in previous paragraphs, so it seems very out-of-the-blue.\n- In L147/148, it is said that \"directly clustering such high-dimensional features is challenging, ...\". It is a statement that needs to be grounded, even though most people will agree that this is true. Perhaps a quick explanation with a known source would help.   \n- Following on the previous point, in L150/151, \"instability of t-SNE\" should be elaborated on. What are the instabilities of t-SNE, and what causes these issues? It would be a good idea to add a paragraph going into the details of the difficulties of high-dimensional clustering, as well as the limitations of t-SNE. \n- Under Section 3.2 (FDR loss paragraph), the claim \"it more effectively captures the nonlinear structure of data and preserves local neighborhood relationships compared to methods like PCA and UMAP\" needs to be well grounded. Currently, this is a claim made by the authors without a source or other logical reasoning.\n- More explanation is needed on the overall pipeline (Figure 1). Especially, on the addition of VQ code (k) with the state feature. The only description is that \"k is integrated into the state feature ...\" but this is not detailed enough. More details on why this is added back to the state feature, what effects it has, and exactly how the \"expansion into a vector\" happens should be explained in the text."
