    "abstract": "Geometry is a ubiquitous tool in computer graphics, design, and engineering. However, the lack of large shape datasets limits the application of state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and motivates the exploration of alternative learning strategies.  To this end, we introduce geometry-informed neural networks (GINNs) - a framework for training shape-generative neural fields *without data* by leveraging user-specified design requirements in the form of objectives and constraints. By adding *diversity* as an explicit constraint, GINNs avoid mode-collapse and can generate multiple diverse solutions, often required in geometry tasks. Experimentally, we apply GINNs to several introductory problems and a realistic 3D engineering design problem, showing control over geometrical and topological properties, such as surface smoothness or the number of holes. These results demonstrate the potential of training shape-generative models without data, paving the way for new generative design approaches without large datasets.",

                "value": "This work introduces a novel framework for data-free geometry learning. The framework relies on implicit geometry representation - which is a  modulated conditional neural field - where conditioning is on latent variables to ensure diversity. Given such a representation, authors propose to formulate a constrained optimization problem, in practice written down as a set of differentiable losses. The proposed constraints include: minimizing genus, smoothness, and diversity of generated shapes. Authors conduct a series of toy experiments to validate the model, and test it on a single engineering design problem."

Specifically, the authors utilize an implicit neural field to represent the surface of industrial parts. Through optimization objectives in different aspects, the implicit neural field is adjusted to closely match the given targets, such as ensuring the zero-level set of the implicit field aligns with the geometric surface and the first-order derivatives of the implicit field align with the surface normals. Additionally, the authors attempt to introduce a regularization term to promote diverse optimization results. Finally, the authors conduct experiments on a challenging example and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach."

My primary concern is whether we truly have the capability to account for all objective functions based on individual intuition, especially considering that these functions must be feasible, differentiable, and ideally, non-conflicting. For instance, how should we approach the generation of a nut that matches a specific type of screw, or a particular joint bearing?\n\nMoreover, while the article emphasizes its data-free approach, it appears to me as an optimization-based strategy, with the optimization target being the implicit field represented by the neural network\u2014a relatively conventional method. I do not find this particularly innovative.\n\nAdditionally, although Figure 6 does showcase a variety of workpieces, I doubt the compliance of these pieces with standard usage requirements; many seem to be diverse merely for the sake of diversity. \n\nLastly, the experiments are conducted on only one workpiece, which, despite its complexity, does not suffice to demonstrate the universality of the method."

In Section 4 it claims that there\u2019s no established baselines, problems, and metrics for the data-free shape-generative modeling. Does it mean that there is no related work trying to solve the engineering design problem presented in Section 4.3??\n- I understand that there are very much information to be presented in the paper. But it is a bit difficult to capture the key information. For example, the \u201ctopology\u201d \u201csmoothness\u201d \u201csurface sampling\u201d are the defined metrics for each constraint? It\u2019s better to have \u201cconstrained optimization\u201d, \u201cmetrics\u201d, \u201cmodels\u201d in bold font, and list all the metrics under the heading.

My only doubt is whether there are indeed no existing works to be compared with. I'd like to increase my rating if the authors can give more explanation on this."

The research proposes the idea of a framework, but it does not demonstrate a working instantiation of the idea, so the research is only in its beginning stages. I think the concept is potentially very promising, but there are also predictable and significant obstacles that must be overcome. Design by optimization is a longstanding topic in many fields, but there are also many problems. Most notably, there aren't many or even any good examples of where optimization alone can give rise to interesting designs. Most of the time, this requires a good initialization that is already a design or the combination of user input (design) and optimization. For example, in architectural design you typically need an initial surface and you can design a pattern on the surface (e.g. a paneling). In furniture design, you also typically need to restrict the design space to a meaningful subset, e.g. by providing procedural rules or templates. At the moment, the method is an extension of an idea that does not have a working instantiation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The major weakness of the paper is the lack of meaningful designs. Without interesting design examples, the paper is not meaningful. None of the designs shown in the paper are interesting and they cannot be recognized as mechanical, biological, architectural, ... objects. These are abstract designs like abstract art, and it is not meaningful to create art by optimization and then infer how this would transfer to engineering. I would suggest a three-step approach to tackling this problem:\n1) The project should identify an example where a single interesting design can be created by optimization. This example should not be abstract but specific to an engineering problem and be recognizable as an intentional and meaningful design. This example can be generated by optimization alone. It doesn't matter if the design is from architecture, mechanical engineering, biology, geology, ... but it should be meaningful. If you want to go for something more discrete, I would recommend furniture or CAD designs. This may not work well with your framework, so I could imagine that free-form architecture could be a better application area, e.g. \"Geodesic patterns\", developable surfaces, self-supporting surfaces, or quad meshes.\n2) The project should expand from this single design to generate a set of diverse designs by combining optimization with a diversity constraint.\n3) The project should example from a set of designs generated by optimization to combining optimization with generative modeling.\n\nThe current submission does not have a demonstration of either 1, 2, or 3. Competing work (not cited) has at least somewhat of a demonstration of points 1 and 2 (e.g., \"Fit and Diverse: Set Evolution for Inspiring 3D Shape Galleries\"), but it would be desirable to have even better examples. \n\n\nIt is possible to accept the paper for conceptual novelty, but I am not in favor of such a philosophy. A paper should introduce a conceptual novelty and at the same time introduce a working realization, not only the conceptual novelty. The conceptual novelty by itself should not be enough for publication. I conjecture that the reason why there aren't many other papers on this topic is because people could not find meaningful and working instantiations of this concept. There is an obvious approach: first generate a set of objects by optimization (e.g. furniture) and then train a generative model on this set. I am not aware of such a successful approach and a paper in this space should possibly demonstrate that it can beat such a baseline.."
