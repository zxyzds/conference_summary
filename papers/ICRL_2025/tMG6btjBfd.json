    "title": "SplineGS: Learning Smooth Trajectories in Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing complex scenes with deforming objects for novel view synthesis is a challenging task. Recent works have addressed this with 3D Gaussian Splatting, which effectively reconstructs static scenes with high quality in short training time, by adding specialized modules for the deformations of Gaussian blobs. However, designing an effective deformation module that incorporates appropriate spatiotemporal inductive biases still remains unresolved. To address this issue, we propose SplineGS in this paper, which utilizes non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), an extension of B-spline, to represent temporally smooth deformation. A set of representative trajectories are learned based on NURBS, and the individual trajectories of Gaussian blobs are represented as linear combinations of these trajectories for spatial smoothness. The weights of the combinations are trained based on a multi-resolution hash table and an MLP, with the positions of the Gaussian blobs as the keys. Thanks to this design, the proposed method does not need any regularizers for trajectories, which enables efficient training. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides competitive performance over the existing methods with much shorter training time.",

The authors propose to utilize Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to represent the trajectories of Gaussian blobs, aiming to achieve temporally smooth deformations. This approach is a departure from existing methods that rely on neural representations, which often require explicit regularization or specialized training mechanisms to ensure smooth trajectories.

                "value": "The paper presents a novel approach by employing NURBS to represent Gaussian blob trajectories in dynamic scene reconstruction, a significant contribution to the field of 3D Gaussian splatting.\n\nBy utilizing NURBS, SplineGS provides smooth deformations without the need for explicit regularizers or complex training mechanisms, leading to faster and more efficient training. This efficiency translates to competitive or state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic (D-NeRF) and real-world (Neu3D) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing dynamic scenes."

                "value": "1. While the authors claim that NURBS inherently provide temporal smoothness, the paper lacks direct visual evidence to support this claim. The authors should include visualizations of the Gaussian trajectories generated by SplineGS, compared with trajectories from other methods. For instance, plotting the trajectories over time for a specific Gaussian blob in SplineGS and other methods like 4D-GS or D-3DGS would visually illustrate the differences in smoothness.\n\n2. The paper focuses on modeling the deformation of Gaussian centers and rotations but omits incorporating scaling into its deformation model. This omission could limit the expressiveness and applicability of SplineGS, especially when dealing with objects that undergo significant changes in size or shape during motion. The authors should address this limitation and discuss its potential impact.\n\n3. While the paper claims novelty in its use of NURBS for representing Gaussian blob trajectories, this claim requires further examination. The Spline-NeRF paper (Knodt, 2022) explores the use of Bezier splines for trajectory representation in dynamic scene reconstruction, a conceptually similar approach albeit within a NeRF framework. The authors should cite and acknowledge this related work and elaborate on the specific novelties of their NURBS-based method within the context of 3D Gaussian splatting.\n\n4. The evaluation primarily focuses on datasets with limited camera motion. To comprehensively assess SplineGS's capabilities, the evaluation should be broadened to include datasets with more pronounced camera motion, such as HyperNeRF dataset. This would provide valuable insights into SplineGS's performance under challenging conditions and enable a more direct and thorough comparison with baseline methods like 4D-GS and Deformable 3D Gaussians, which are evaluated on HyperNeRF."

More importantly, this paper does not demonstrate the usefulness of the learned smooth trajectories.\n   2. To obtain the weights, SplineGS employs a multi-resolution hash table and an MLP, which can be treated as learning the weights of LBS through the neural network. Compared to other methods of obtaining LBS weights (such as Gaussian kernel RBF), what are the advantages of using neural networks?\n  3. In my opinion, the shorter training time and higher FPS are more due to L1 regularization of the opacity value in Eq. (15), which reduces the number of Gaussians.\n- Although this paper achievies state-of-the-art or at least competitive performance, hower the performance is not consistent. For example, compared with 4DGS (Yang et al., 2024a), SplineGS achieves higher PSNR and FPS on the D-NeRF dataset, while achieving similar PSNR and lower FPS on the Neu3D dataset. Experiments on more real datasets are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of SplineGS."

As shown in D-3DGS, results on the \u201cLego\u201d scene of the D-NeRF dataset should not be reported, nor should performance on the validation set be reported.\n3. I would like to know the performance of replacing the multi-resolution hash table and MLP with the Gaussian kernel RBF adopted by SC-GS.\n4. It would be better to provide some videos to intuitively demonstrate the performance of SplineGS.\n5. Are there any failure cases?

For example, SC-GS shows better rendering quality on the D-NeRF dataset, and on the Neu3D dataset, SplineGS\u2019 PSNR is only 0.03 dB higher than STG. It seems like SplineGS' main contribution is creating smooth trajectories for Gaussians, but only the visualization in Figure 1 supports this. I suggest adding visualizations that shows the Gaussians being learned in a smooth trajectory on various scenes.\n\n2. In line 85, the B-spline functions as a smooth regularizer, but according to line 231, rendering requires $p + M + 1$ additional points. Using the smooth regularizer should allow rendering with just one point, which seems inefficient. Therefore, a comparison of the trade-off between rendering speed and rendering quality is necessary, especially in contrast to using the regularizer.\n\n3. The appearance or disappearance of objects cannot be handled, as mentioned in the conclusion. However, in real-world scenes like Neu3D, I believe that such cases also exist, but there is a lack of analysis on this aspect. In Fig. 6, the flame streak scene in Neural 3D Video shows flames appearing and disappearing, suggesting that the method may handle disappearing objects. However, it remains unclear how SplineGS manages this. I recommend an analysis, such as visualizing the trajectories of the Gaussians.\n\n4.
