    "abstract": "In medical image registration tasks where targets exhibit piece-wise smooth structures, a well-designed low-resolution data structure can approximate full-resolution deformation fields with minimal accuracy loss. \nThis physical prior, though absent in current literature, can be integrated into neural networks to enhance registration. \nIn this paper, we propose AdaWarp, a novel architecture that leverages the prior for more efficient medical image registration. \nAdaWarp consists of an encoder, guidance map generator, and a differentiable bilateral grid, introducing an edge-preserving low-frequency approximation of the deformation field. \nThis approach reduces computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy.\nExperiments on two registration datasets covering different modalities and input constraints demonstrate that AdaWarp outperforms existing methods in accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness tradeoffs.",

                "value": "This paper leverages prior knowledge observed in medical images to introduce the Piece-wise Smooth (P-S) Assumption as a basis for addressing medical image registration tasks. Specifically, the authors propose AdaWarp, a warping method that utilizes learnable adaptive filtering to register medical scans in line with the P-S assumption. By employing a low-resolution latent representation along with a differentiable bilateral grid, the method achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two registration datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

By analyzing daily CT and MRI scans in the cardiac and abdominal regions, the authors observed two consistent patterns across certain subjects, leading to the formulation of the Piece-wise Smooth (P-S) Assumption. This assumption leverages physical priors from observed medical image patterns, which is both innovative and plausible, enhancing neural network-based registration tasks by grounding them in realistic assumptions about medical image structures.\n2. The paper provides thorough comparative experiments. The authors test AdaWarp on two registration datasets spanning different modalities and input constraints, which demonstrates robustness and broad applicability."

While the method leverages an encoder to extract a latent representation that approximates the deformation field at a low resolution, this approach mainly contributes to the model's efficiency but is not unique. The use of latent feature representations for similar tasks has already become common in the field.\n2.  The core of AdaWarp is a differentiable bilateral grid,  which naturally incorporates the P-S prior.  In implementation, the guidance map aids in processes like splatting, blurring, and slicing. This incremental modification lacks sufficient novelty."

After the introduction of deep learning-based registration methods, e.g., VoxelMorph, existing methods have been very fast in registration, allowing real-time registration using GPUs. Under this situation, only a few studies have specifically focused on improving efficiency, which suggests that this topic might not be the real problem in the community.  \n2. Another concern is the generalizability of the P-S assumption. In the study, this assumption was exemplified and evaluated with cardiac MRI and abdomen CT images, where there is no too many complex anatomical structures and local deformations. It\u2019s important to evaluate the proposed method on the well-benchmarked brain MRI registration tasks, in which the P-S assumption may fail."

VoxelMorph is the most widely-benchmarked method and has high efficiency with low number of parameters.  \n2. There is a recent registration study in CVPR (CorrMLP, Meng et al. 2024), which is based on a totally conflicting motivation against this paper. CorrMLP attempted to capture long-range dependency among full-resolution image details in an efficient approach (using MLPs), while this paper suggests that only low-resolution features are sufficient. So, it\u2019s interesting to compare with the CorrMLP: did the proposed method achieve similar registration accuracy while reducing much computational complexity?"

How were these values tuned? Were they also tuned for the baselines?\n\n[E] The proposed method utilizes a diffeomorphic transformation model; however, it is not clear whether the baselines follow the same principle. Could the authors provide a table that explicitly lists the hyperparameters used by each of the baselines along with the transformation model?\n\n[F] The authors chose different baselines for the two datasets, which is puzzling. What is the intuition behind this decision? Is there a reason why this approach was chosen?\n\n[G] The paper presents t-tests for DICE scores but not for other metrics.

These limitations are why I rated the paper as \"fair\" in terms of Presentation and Soundness.\n\n\n1. The paper needs more references in the literature review. The current review only discusses works that do not address the conflict between global smoothness and local deformations. However, this is not the first paper to tackle this problem. Research such as multi-scale registration and patch-wise registration also offers relevant solutions. While these methods may not explicitly incorporate the piece-wise smooth prior, they still manage local deformations while maintaining overall smoothness. The authors should include these references in the background and select baselines from this body of work to show that the proposed method offers a superior solution to the problem.\n\n2. The experiments do not adequately support the claimed advantages of the proposed method. While the paper argues that the model can generate sharp boundaries between organs by incorporating the P-S assumption, it fails to provide visual results to substantiate this key contribution. Relying solely on numerical metrics like Dice, HD95, and SDlogJ does not clearly demonstrate that the model\u2019s output preserves sharp boundaries.\n\n3. The writing in the experiments section is somewhat disorganized. The authors employ significantly different model structures and training strategies, including both unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches (which require further clarification), depending on the dataset. This inconsistency raises concerns about the generalizability of the model across different tasks. Additionally, the experiments lack ablation studies, which are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed methods."

A comparison of these model structures across datasets could help demonstrate their generalizability and clarify why different architectures were chosen for each.\n\n2. In the Abdomen CT dataset, Ada-Cost uses \u201cthe same segmentation model for feature extraction.\u201d Was this segmentation model pre-trained? If so, this would make Ada-Cost a semi-supervised registration model. Comparing it with other unsupervised deep learning-based methods would be unfair. Additionally, how exactly was the segmentation model integrated into your model\u2019s structure? Does it replace the \"guidance map generator,\" or is it incorporated elsewhere in the architecture?\n\n3. More references, more baselines and visual evaluations of warped images and warped segmentation masks would be highly valuable. Providing such visual results would help demonstrate the effectiveness of your method in producing sharp boundaries, which cannot be fully illustrated through numerical metrics alone.\n\n4. I would greatly appreciate it if the paper could provide information on the inference and training time of the proposed method. This data would offer more valuable insights into the computational efficiency of the model.\n\n5. Another concern is that the authors selected \"interpretability and explainable AI\" as Primary Area. I\u2019m not sure if this is appropriate since there is no work about interpretability of proposed method."
