    "title": "Optimal Flow Transport and its Entropic Regularization: a GPU-friendly Matrix Iterative Algorithm for Flow Balance Satisfaction",
    "abstract": "The Sinkhorn algorithm, based on Entropic Regularized Optimal Transport (OT), has garnered significant attention due to its computational efficiency enabled by GPU-friendly matrix-vector multiplications. However, vanilla OT primarily deals with computations between the source and target nodes in a bipartite graph, limiting its practical application in real-world transportation scenarios.\nIn this paper, we introduce the concept of Optimal Flow Transport (OFT) as an extension, where we consider a more general graph case and the marginal constraints in vanilla OT are replaced by flow balance constraints. \nTo obtain solutions, we incorporate entropic regularization into the OFT and introduce virtual flows for individual nodes to tackle the issue of potentially numerous isolated nodes lacking flow passages. Our proposition, the OFT-Sinkhorn algorithm, utilizes GPU-friendly matrix iterations to maintain flow balance constraints and minimize the objective function, and theoretical results for global convergence are also proposed in this paper.\nFurthermore, we enhance OFT by introducing capacity constraints on nodes and edges, transforming the OFT problem into a minimum-cost flow problem. We then present the Capacity-Constrained EOFT-Sinkhorn algorithm and compare it with the traditional Minimum cost flow (MCF) algorithm, showing that our algorithm is quite efficient for calculation. \nIn particular, our EOFT-Sinkhorn is evaluated on high-precision and integer-precision MCF problems with different scales from one hundred to five thousand size, exhibiting significant time efficiency and the ability to approximate optimal solutions. Source code will be made publicly available.",

This work claims to extend OT to general graphs with flow balance constraints, which is essentially a restatement of the classic minimum cost flow (MCF) problem. The MCF problem is well-studied, and applying entropic regularization is a common practice. Secondly, this paper needs further literature review of existing work that applies similar techniques to the MCF problem using GPU acceleration or matrix-based methods. such as [1][2]. Additionally, another concern is that this paper does not show how their proposed method benefits the machine learning community. There is a lack of discussion on the applications of MCF in machine learning tasks, and no such experiments are provided. Given these weaknesses, I tend to reject this paper.\n\n[1] Harish, Pawan, Vibhav Vineet, and P. J.

Adding entropy regularization directly cannot derive an algorithm to obtain an approximate solution as directly as vanilla OT due to two reasons. First of all, there are many isolated points that do not have any flow passing through them in the exact solution, while under entropy regularization, flows are necessarily channeled through them, causing significant bias. Second, the flow balance constraint cannot directly form an alternating iterative algorithm like the marginal constraint. The authors address these issues by modifying the original problem formulation and proposing the new OFT-Sinkhorn algorithm. The new approach utilizes GPU-friendly matrix iterations and is guaranteed to converge globally (with the rate). The authors also extend their approach to a more general setting where the capacity constraints on nodes\nand edges are avaliable. The encouraging empirical results are presented and discussed."

While I agree that it is meaningful to replace the marginal constraints by by flow balance constraints on nodes, this idea is novel by itself and the optimal flow transport problem in Eq. (2) is rather standard. \n\n2. It is important to note that directly adding entropy regularization cannot derive an algorithm to obtain an approximate solution as directly as vanilla OT. However, I do not think addressing this issue would be difficult and the modified formulation is Eq. (5) is also based on some standard tricks from network flow literature. Based on this formulation, the development of OFT-Sinkhorn algorithm is almost the same as that of Sinkhorn algorithm and handling node and edge capacity constraints would not significantly change the algorithmic scheme. \n\nI would like to say that I do not undermine the value of new methods but the contribution of this paper is a little bit incremental to me from a technical viewpoint.

For example, you state that the previous studies primarily rely on graph\u2019s shortest distances and do not directly compute transport couplings within the graph. In my understanding, these studies can compute transport couplings but need to precompute the shortest distances on the graph (please correct me if I am wrong). Then, why can you directly compute transport couplings within the graph? It seems counterintuitive to me if this is only because you use the entropy regularization. Would you like to provide me more details? \n\n2. You state that your EOFT-Sinkhorn is evaluated on high-precision and integer-precision MCF problems with different scales from one hundred to five thousand size, exhibiting significant time efficiency and the ability to approximate optimal solutions. The experimental results confirm that your method can achieve a solution of higher quality. It is a bit surprising since the vanilla implementation of Sinkhorn algorithm requires much time to converge to a high-accurate solution. Would you like to give me some reasons why your method could achieve the high-accurate solutions in practice?"

There are numerous instances of grammatical errors in this work. The authors are advised to change it. (This doesn't affect this reviewer's evaluation for the score.)\n\n3. While OFT-Sinkhorn with edge/node/node&edge constraints is definitely a good contribution, it doesn't seem clear why one would not simply use Sinkhorn in the unconstrained case. The authors have not included numerical comparison to make this point across. What is better? Sinkhorn has more GPU acceleration and should be much better in the unconstrained case (say, you take the same regularization strength and compare results).\n\n4. In the numerical experiments, the proposed OFT-Sinkhorn algorithm seems to do better than Gurobi, which is quite confusing as Gurobi should output the ground truth. The reviewer suspects that it is because the OFT-Sinkhorn solution is unfeasible, thereby giving a better objective. If this interpretation is correct, then the authors need to change to a better metric for comparison.\n\n5. The benchmark ZKW and Real methods are exact methods and they do not seem to be up to date. The authors need to also consider state-of-the-art methods for comparison, and the authors need to consider approximate algorithms.\n\n6. The conclusion section needs a rewrite. It seems to suggest that this method can solve NP-hard graph-based problems, which is why the wording needs to be refined."
