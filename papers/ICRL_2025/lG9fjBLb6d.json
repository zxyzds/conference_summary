    "title": "RFMamba: Frequency-Aware State Space Model for RF-Based Human-Centric Perception",
    "abstract": "Human-centric perception with radio frequency (RF) signals has recently entered a new era of end-to-end processing with Transformers. Considering the long-sequence nature of RF signals, the State Space Model (SSM) has emerged as a superior alternative due to its effective long-sequence modeling and linear complexity. However, integrating SSM into RF-based sensing presents unique challenges including the fundamentally different signal representation, distinct frequency responses in different scenarios, and incomplete capture caused by specular reflection. To address this, we carefully devise a dual-branch SSM block that is characterized by adaptively grasping the most informative frequency cues and the assistant spatial information to fully explore the human representations from radar echoes. Based on these two branchs, we further introduce an SSM-based network for handling various downstream human perception tasks, named RFMamba. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed RFMamba across all three downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, RFMamba is the first attempt to introduce SSM into RF-based human-centric perception.",

Consequently, the paper\u2019s title, which references RF-based human-centric perception, may overstate the scope, as other radar types and RF-based sensing modalities (e.g., Wi-Fi, RFID, LoRa) are not examined. The authors should clarify their motivation for selecting SFCW radar, including its advantages over existing options like TI mmWave radar.\n\n(2) The introduction of SFCW radar in Section 3.1.1 lacks clarity. For example, it is unclear how Eq. 3 represents the signal across three key dimensions: fast time (distance), antenna (azimuth and elevation), and slow time (velocity across echoes). A more detailed explanation in this section would improve understanding.\n\n(3) In the related work section, more state-of-the-art studies on wireless signal sensing relevant to RF pose estimation should be reviewed. The authors should also discuss distinctions between the proposed Mamba method and other Mamba-based methods.\n\n(4) For the framework depicted in Fig. 2, while each block is briefly explained, more specific functionality should be provided, including details on the SiLU block. Additionally, the loss function and training approach require elaboration. For instance, the rationale for using different task losses to define the joint training loss in Eq. 11 should be clarified. Since the code is not provided, a detailed description of the training algorithm is needed.\n\n(5) Though the proposed method is tested with a real-world setup, it would benefit from validation using a public dataset, such as an mmWave radar dataset. The authors should also consider benchmarking against advanced transformer models and other Mamba methods. Furthermore, the evaluation on generalization and multi-person scenarios is limited; additional tests across different time (different days) and involving more than three individuals would strengthen the findings."

The authors have compared their method with baselines in terms of the number of parameters, while the authors can also compare their detailed efficiency, such as training time, testing time, and throughput.\n4.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of sequence length analysis: While the authors emphasize the model's capability to handle variable and long input sequences, they do not provide an analysis of how sequence length affects performance, efficiency, or stability. It would be useful to see experiments with varying sequence lengths, insights into computational complexity and memory impact, and clarification on the sequence length used in their experiments.\n2. Potential for improved transformer-based model: The lower performance of RadarFormer likely reflects specific design choices rather than a fundamental transformer limitation for RF perception (e.g., using only amplitudes, using two successive frames instead of 12). The authors did not explore enhancements to RadarFormer, such as incorporating phase information, extending the temporal context, or adding RF-specific adaptations, which may have yielded results comparable to or better than RFMamba, questioning the necessity of Mamba-based SSMs.\n3. Unclear design choices: Some design decisions are not fully explained. For instance, in Figure 3(a), the scanning path appears to follow a bidirectional approach converging at the center. It is unclear why the authors did not consider capturing both sequences (from T\u22126 to T+6 and T+6 to T\u22126) and concatenating them, which could potentially enrich the temporal representation and improve performance.\n4. Lack of details on activity types, distribution, and environment diversity: The paper lacks specifics on the 19 activities in the THP dataset, their frequency distribution, and whether participants performed these activities statically or while moving freely. This is important for understanding the model\u2019s generalization across activity types and movement patterns in RF-based perception. Additionally, the dataset was collected primarily in a single environment (with and without a wall), limiting environmental diversity. It remains unclear if the model would perform similarly in different settings, whether it would need extensive data collection, or if fine-tuning would be required in new environments.\n5. Limited dataset accessibility: Although the THP dataset provides valuable scenarios for evaluating RF-based human perception, it is not confirmed for public release, restricting reproducibility and broader research applications in this area.\n6. Unclear real-time performance: The paper lacks analysis on the compute and memory requirements needed for real-time performance, leaving practical deployment feasibility uncertain.\n7. Lack of generalization comparison with baseline models: While the authors claim that RFMamba generalizes well across various scenarios, there is no direct comparison with existing methods on generalization performance. Without showing how baseline models perform in similar conditions, it is difficult to assess whether RFMamba\u2019s improvements are specific to the training environment or if they extend to varied, unseen scenarios."

Would the proposed method generalize to FMCW radar systems as well, and if so, what adjustments might be necessary?\n5.
