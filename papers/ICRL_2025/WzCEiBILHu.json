    "abstract": "Given two boundary distributions, the \\emph{Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge} (SB) problem seeks the \u201cmost likely\u201d random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. \nIt has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. \nWhile these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows.\nIn this work, we propose the \\emph{Topological Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem} ($\\mathcal{T}$SBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. \nWe set the reference process to follow some linear tractable \\emph{topology-aware} stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. \nFor the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a \\emph{closed-form} topological SB ($\\mathcal{T}$SB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. \nIn the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns.\nBuilding on these results, we develop $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as \\emph{(topological) neural networks} and learning them through \\emph{likelihood training}. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. \nAdditionally, we discuss the connections of $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching.",

                "value": "*Experiments.*\nI believe the authors should conduct additional experiments to show the advantages and limitations of their method. There are many toy datasets or graph that could be used in addition to this one, for instance a Swiss roll (potentially rotated in higher dimensions) on which you can generate from a distribution or interpolate between distributions. I also think that reporting additional metrics for evaluation would be beneficial, for instance MMD, Wassertein etc, between predicted and ground truth distributions. \n\nIt is difficult to assess the improvement of the method on figure 2 or 3. Quantitative results along the lines of table 1 are much better. Since this data appears to have multiple timepoints, the authors could validate the quality of interpolation by training with holding out one timepoint and predicting it at inference. The same experiment, should be conducted on multiple datasets, e.g. datasets from [3,4].\n\n*On solution complexity.*\nIt is mentioned that $\\Psi_t$ can be computed efficiently, but this requires the eigendecomposition of L, which scales at O(n^3) for an $n \\times n$ L. Did the authors try other approximation methods such as Chebyshev (e.g. used in [1]) or Cholesky (e.g. used in [2]) ? These methods scale much better for on a sparse graph. Additionally,, it would be beneficial to add experiments on complexity and training time with respect to the size of the Laplacian."

The new method is called topological Schrodinger Bridge Matching (TSBM). The authors develop a topological version of the Schrodinger bridge using a stochastic differential equation driven by a topological convolution. In the case of graphs, this can be driven by the graph heat equation with graph Laplacian. In the case where both distributions to be matched are Gaussian distributions, they give closed form solutions that generalize previous work on Schrodinger bridges. Using this framework, the authors developed a TSB-based method for topological signal generation and matching, based on parameterizing the policy with a topological neural network. The authors also provided the results of some numerical experiments on ocean current matching and modeling seismic events, along with some synthetic experiments.\n\nA couple of typos I noticed: \" a diffusion ndoe GP\", \"Vairous topological\", \"the spacial case\", \"we showed that the optimal process satisfy a pair\""

There is a substantial difference in terms of the diffusion process generated on the graph if one uses the unnormalized versus the random walk Laplacian (with the latter being the natural choice for diffusion on graphs).

Testing across a broader range of real-world network types (e.g., biological, transportation, or communication networks) would better demonstrate the broad applicability of TSBP and strengthen the claims of generalizability. If extending the experimental coverage is impractical, the paper should provide code to enable other researchers to explore the applicability and limitations of TSBP across different types of network-structured data.\n- The primary focus on Gaussian boundary distributions restricts practical generalizability, as many real-world networked data scenarios involve non-Gaussian or mixed-distribution boundary conditions.\n-  The method\u2019s computational demands are high, particularly in large-scale networks.
