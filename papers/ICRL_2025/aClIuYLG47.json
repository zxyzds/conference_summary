    "title": "VideoUntier: Language-guided Video Feature Disentanglement",
    "abstract": "Most of existing text-video retrieval works learn features comprehensively representing complicated video contents. This leads to the difficulty of textual-visual feature alignment, because text queries convey more concise cues like certain objects and events the user desires to retrieve. To pursue a more compact video representation and accurate textual-visual feature matching, this paper introduces a novel VideoUntier to disentangle video features. VideoUntier first generates 'object' and 'event' tokens from query texts. It subsequently spots and merges visual tokens related to concepts in the query. In other words, we use 'object' and 'event' tokens to represent cues of query, which therefore supervise the disentanglement and extraction of meaningful visual features from videos. VideoUntier finally leads to compact visual tokens explicitly depicting query objects and events. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrate the promising performance and domain generalization capability of our method. For instance, our method shows better efficiency and consistently outperforms many recent works like ProST on three datasets. We hope to inspire future work for collaborative cross-modal learning with certain modality as guidance.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a method to improve text-video retrieval (TVR) by addressing the misalignment between complex video features and concise text queries. The proposed framework, VideoUntier, leverages object and event tokens extracted from text queries to guide video feature extraction, reducing noise and enhancing alignment. It consists of two main components: the Part-of-Speech-based Token Generator (PTG) and the Language-guided Progressive Vision Merging (LPVM) module. Experiments on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo datasets show that VideoUntier outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the benefits of text-guided video feature disentanglement."

The core idea of using object and event text features to guide video feature extraction has similarities to existing works, such as \"Fine-grained video-text retrieval with hierarchical graph reasoning\" (CVPR 2020). This work should be cited and compared to, as the proposed cross-attention-based object merger is conceptually similar to the attentive matching techniques previously explored.\n- The experimental section lacks evaluations against some recent and relevant methods. Specifically, baseline comparisons with works like \"Cap4Video: What Can Auxiliary Captions Do for Text-Video Retrieval?\" (CVPR 2023), \"T2VLAD: Global-Local Sequence Alignment for Text-Video Retrieval\" (CVPR 2021), and \"Disentangled Representation Learning for Text-Video Retrieval\" (ECCV 2022) are essential for a comprehensive assessment of the method\u2019s effectiveness. The omission of these baselines reduces the clarity of how the proposed model stands relative to state-of-the-art approaches.\n- The reliance on a Part-of-Speech-based Token Generator for parsing sentences introduces additional computational overhead. This design choice raises concerns about the model's practicality and scalability in real-world applications, where processing speed is critical.\n- Given the complexity of the proposed framework, the performance improvements over existing methods are relatively modest.\n- The parsing-based approach might not offer significant advantages over simpler models, such as DRL or X-Pool, which use direct word query-based matching."

Given the truth that the authors anchor object-level visual cues with nouns and event-level visual cues with verbs in the corresponding text using an attention-based method, this approach has also been explored in the literature. Some prior works delve even further, utilizing optical flow or other motion-based information to model event-level cues. \n\nSome closely related works that share similar ideas:\n\n[1] Text-Video Retrieval with Disentangled Conceptualization and Set-to-Set Alignment.

On the other hand, while the hierarchical modeling (global-and local-level) for text-video retrieval is a commendable concept, given the existing efforts that share similar knowledge within the community, the novelty this work brings might be perceived as marginal for publication in ICLR. \n\nSome closely related works that share similar ideas:\n\n[1]T2VLAD: Global-Local Sequence Alignment for Text-Video Retrieval.
