    "title": "LogicVista: Multimodal LLM Logical Reasoning Benchmark in Visual Contexts",
    "abstract": "We propose LogicVista , an evaluation benchmark that examines multimodal large language models\u2019 (MLLMs) integrated Logical reasoning capacities in Visual contexts. Recent advancements in MLLMs have demonstrated various fascinating abilities such as crafting poetry based on an image to engaging in mathematical reasoning. Despite these feats, there remains a gap in the systematic examination of MLLMs\u2019 proficiency in logical reasoning tasks. These skills are routinely invoked in navigation, puzzle-solving, etc. Thus we present LogicVista, which evaluates general logical cognition abilities across a spectrum of 5 logical reasoning tasks with 3 broad capabilities and 11 specific capabilities through a sample of 448 multiple-choice questions. Each is annotated with not only the correct answer but also the human written reasoning behind the selection, allowing for rich open- ended evaluation as well as MCQ evaluation. A total of 11 MLLMs undergo comprehensive evaluation using LogicVista. We are also introducing a crowdsourced annotation tool to further scale LogicVista with support from the community.

Need some citations to support this claim.\n\n(3) The **categorisation** of skills, broad and specific capabilities need further explanations or authorized references. Did you refer to previous MLLM evaluation research? For example, FLASK [4] refers to this QA taxonomy [5] for the definition of skills.\n\n(4) Regarding the **quantity** of this dataset, there are only 448 questions, much smaller than datasets in this category, such as ScienceQA (21208 questions) and MathVista (6141 questions).\n\n[1] MathVista: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Foundation Models in Visual Contexts https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02255\n\n[2] MMMU: A Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Expert AGI https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16502\n\n[3] Learn to Explain: Multimodal Reasoning via Thought Chains for Science Question Answering https://scienceqa.github.io/\n\n[4] FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10928\n\n[5] QA Dataset Explosion: A Taxonomy of NLP Resources for Question Answering and Reading Comprehension https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12708\n\n**Some minor weaknesses:**\n\n- Lack of human annotation details: As the authors state there is cross-validation during annotation, what is the inter-annotator agreement? How much payment is given to each annotator? How many hours does it take to finish annotation?\n\n- Reliability of LLM-based evaluator on the chain-of-thought: What is the agreement rate between human-based and LLM-based evaluators on the rationales?

This evaluation fills gaps in current methodologies and holds significant potential for advancing research in the multimodal domain.\n2. Rigorous Data Source: The paper uses authorized IQ test data, which avoids the common issue of public data leakage and ensures fairness in the evaluation. This data is more reflective of the models\u2019 reasoning capabilities, rather than merely testing memory or simple inference abilities.\n3. Multidimensional Evaluation Approach: By combining MCQ and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, the paper efficiently quantifies the model\u2019s selection ability while also deeply analyzing its reasoning process, balancing both evaluation depth and efficiency.\n4. Scalability and Continuous Updates: The introduction of crowdsourced annotation tools ensures the dataset\u2019s scalability and future updates, laying a solid foundation for iterative evaluations.\n5. Clear Language and Logical Presentation: The paper is clearly written, with well-structured logic and organized presentation of experimental results, aiding readers in understanding its contributions."

The dataset size is also limited, potentially hindering the ability to fully capture the model\u2019s performance across a broader range of tasks.\n2. Lack of Depth in Benchmark Design and Ablation Studies: The paper primarily uses random and frequentist baselines, which provide limited insights into the deeper aspects of reasoning. The absence of ablation studies restricts the analysis of how different model components contribute to performance. Introducing more complex baselines and conducting ablation studies could enhance the interpretability of the results.\n3. Redundant Logical Expressions: The distinction between the \u201cBroad Capabilities\u201d and \u201cSpecific Capabilities\u201d sections in 4.2 is somewhat redundant, particularly in the discussion of OCR and diagram tasks. Simplifying these sections and clearly distinguishing between the two could improve the clarity of the paper\u2019s logic."

For example, while models perform relatively well in deductive and mechanical reasoning, they perform less effectively in inductive, numerical, and spatial reasoning tasks. This variation may affect the fairness of overall performance evaluations.\n2. The paper notes that current visual encoders face substantial limitations in recognizing spatial and abstract relationships, particularly in complex spatial reasoning and 3D pattern recognition tasks, where models tend to underperform. However, the paper lacks specific improvement suggestions, such as ways to enhance visual encoders or improve training data to boost reasoning ability, which somewhat constrains future developmental direction.\n3. There is a lack of ablation studies to deeply analyze the specific contributions of each component to overall performance. Ablation studies can reveal the independent impact of each module, helping to better understand model composition and optimization paths."
