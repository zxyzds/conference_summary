    "title": "A Graph Enhanced Symbolic Discovery Framework For Efficient Circuit Synthesis",
    "abstract": "The efficiency of Circuit Synthesis (CS) has become one of the key bottlenecks in chip design. To prompt efficient CS, previous studies propose using a key scoring function to predict and prune a large number of ineffective nodes of the CS heuristics. \nHowever, the existing scoring functions struggle to balance inference efficiency, interpretability, and\ngeneralization performance, which severely hinders their application to modern CS tools. To address this challenge, we propose a novel data-driven circuit symbolic learning framework, namely CMO, to learn lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable scoring functions.\nThe major challenge of developing CMO is to discover symbolic functions that can well generalize to unseen circuits, i.e., the circuit symbolic generalization problem. Thus, the major technical contribution of CMO is the novel $\\textit{Graph Enhanced Symbolic Discovery} $ framework, which distills dark knowledge from a well-designed graph neural network (GNN) to enhance the generalization capability of the learned symbolic functions. To the best of our knowledge, CMO is $\\textit{the first}$ graph-enhanced approach for discovering lightweight and interpretable symbolic functions that can well generalize to unseen circuits in CS. Experiments on three challenging circuit benchmarks show that the $\\textit{interpretable}$ symbolic functions learned by CMO outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) GPU-based and human-designed approaches in terms of $\\textit{inference efficiency}$ and $\\textit{generalization capability}$. Moreover, we integrate CMO with the Mfs2 heuristic---one of the most time-consuming CS heuristics. \nThe empirical results demonstrate that CMO significantly improves its efficiency while keeping comparable optimization performance when executed on a CPU-based machine, achieving up to 2.5$\\times$ faster runtime.",

                "value": "This authors propose a novel data-driven circuit symbolic learning framework, CMO. It learns a symbolic scoring function balancing inference efficiency, interpretability, and generalization performance. While existing approaches often struggle with these trade-offs in modern circuit synthesis (CS) tools, CMO demonstrates superior capability in discovering lightweight and interpretable symbolic functions from a decomposed symbolic space. The major technical contribution of CMO is the Graph Enhanced Symbolic Discovery (GESD) framework, which employs a specially designed Graph Neural Network (GNN) to guide the generation of symbolic trees. CMO is the first graph-enhanced approach for discovering lightweight and interpretable symbolic functions that effectively generalize to unseen circuits in CS."

Based on the related works and experiments, this paper appears to focus on logic optimization.\n### Datasets\nThe labels of circuit datasets should be clarified. When mentioning node-level transformation, does it mean it is effective for the current step of logic optimization or for overall performance? Effectiveness in the current step may not translate to overall performance in logic optimization.\n### Experiments\nThe experiment part is somewhat confusing. The focus of logic optimization should be on time cost and node reduction during the online phase. The offline phase appears more like an ablation study. Experiments on generalization should be highlighted in the main part of the manuscript. Experiment 4 should showcase generalization compared to other baselines like COG, but why other SR methods? Is this an ablation study of the SR method used?\n### Generalization\nEPFL, IWLS, and an industrial-level dataset from Huawei HiSilicon are used to train the GNN. Are the datasets mixed to train a single GNN, or are three separate GNNs trained for each dataset?"
