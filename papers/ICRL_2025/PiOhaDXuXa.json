    "abstract": "We present Bayesian Binary Search (BBS), a novel probabilistic variant of the classical binary search/bisection algorithm. BBS leverages machine learning/statistical techniques to estimate the probability density of the search space and modifies the bisection step to split based on probability density rather than the traditional midpoint, allowing for the learned distribution of the search space to guide the search algorithm. Search space density estimation can flexibly\nbe performed using supervised probabilistic machine learning techniques (e.g., Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural networks, quantile regression) or unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., Gaussian mixture models, kernel density estimation (KDE), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)). We demonstrate significant efficiency gains of using BBS on both simulated data across a variety of distributions and in a real-world binary search use case of probing channel balances in the Bitcoin Lightning Network, for which we have deployed the BBS algorithm in a production setting.",

Instead, they simulate probing by using inexpensive predictions from a random forest model, which removes the practical need for BBS to reduce costly network probes.\n\n- Since predictions from the random forest are computationally cheap, the added complexity of BBS (which relies on density estimation and probabilistic bisection) offers limited benefit in this context. \n\n- There is no reported raw computation time. The added computational overhead of first performing density estimation would likely be much larger than the marginal gains achieved when performing BBS over binary search.\n\nIn summary, the experiment does not convincingly demonstrate BBS\u2019s utility in addressing real-world probing expenses. Without actual network interaction, it fails to showcase how BBS would reduce probing costs in a live setting, which is the central argument for its use."

This framework promises better efficiency for non-uniform distribution, while reduces to traditional binary search when the distribution is uniform.\n2.
