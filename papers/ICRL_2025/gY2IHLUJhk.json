    "title": "Towards Robustness of Person Search against Corruptions",
    "abstract": "Person search aims to simultaneously detect and re-identify a query person within an entire scene, involving detection and re-identification as a multi-task problem.\nWhile existing studies have made significant progress in achieving superior performance on clean datasets, the challenge of robustness under various corruptions remains largely unexplored.\nTo address this gap, we propose two benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU-C and PRW-C, designed to assess the robustness of person search models across diverse corruption scenarios.\nPrevious researches on corruption have been conducted independently for single tasks such as re-identification and detection.\nHowever, recent advancements in person search adopt an end-to-end multi-task learning framework that processes the entire scene as input, unlike the combination of single tasks. \nThis raises the question of whether independent achievements can ensure corruption robustness for person search.\nOur findings reveal that merely combining independent, robust detection and re-identification models is not sufficient for achieving robust person search. \nWe further investigate the vulnerability of the detection and representation stages to corruption and explore its impact on both foreground and background areas.\nBased on these insights, we propose a foreground-aware augmentation and regularization method to enhance the robustness of person search models.\nSupported by our comprehensive robustness analysis and evaluation framework our benchmarks provide, our proposed technique substantially improves the robustness of existing person search models.\nCode will be made publicly available.",

However, overall, the dataset construction methods are largely adapted from existing approaches, and the proposed solution is relatively simple, focusing on narrowing the feature gap between corrupted and original images. From a theoretical innovation standpoint, the contributions are limited and fall short of ICLR's high standards.\n\n2. While the foreground-aware augmentation approach is effective, it appears to be an incremental improvement rather than a fundamentally new concept. The paper could be strengthened by deeper theoretical insights into why this method improves robustness beyond empirical results.\n\n3. The paper employs various existing data augmentation methods to simulate real-world disturbances. However, the key question is whether these augmentations can effectively benefit real-world scenarios. If their impact is limited, the constructed datasets may hold little significance."

Subsequently, based on these findings, the authors proposed several methods to improve the model's robustness against corruption, and validated the effectiveness of these methods through extensive experiments.

I am able to follow the core ideas of this work very well.\n\n2. According to the authors, they are the first to study the issue of corruption robustness in the person search task, a problem which I believe has significant practical relevance. In real-world applications, due to the influence of weather, lighting, and other imaging conditions, the sursurveillance videos are prone to corruption. A person search model that can withstand such corruptions is essential.\n\n3. The contributions of this paper are substantial. The paper introduces two corrupted benchmarks CUHK-SYSU-C and PRW-C (as well as an additional manual annotated test set based on BDD100K), and proposes two modules to enhance the model's resistance to corruption, all of which have positive implications for the development of this field.\n\n4.

Since you pointed out that person re-identification representation is important, have you tried to investigate the effect of some person reid pre-trained models on the robustness of the person search model against corruptions?  To my knowledge, pre-training can learn good person re-identification representations, and I would be very interested to see an experiment where you investigate the impact of pre-trained person representations on your task. For instance, you could conduct an experiment with the pre-trained ResNet50 in LUP, UPReID, LUP-NL, ISR, PLIP and CION. \n\nI will greatly appreciate it and **raise the score** if you could conduct the aforementioned experiment that interests me.\n\nReference:\n\nLUP: Unsupervised pre-training for person re-identification (CVPR2021)\n\nUPReID:  Unleashing potential of unsupervised pre-training with intra-identity regularization for person re-identification (CVPR2022)\n\nLUP-NL: Large-scale pre-training for person re-identification with noisy labels (CVPR2022)\n\nISR: Identity-seeking self-supervised representation learning for generalizable person re-identification (ICCV2023)\n\nPLIP: Plip: Language-image pre-training for person representation learning (NeurIPS2024)\n\nCION: Cross-video Identity Correlating for Person Re-identification Pre-training (NeurIPS2024)"
