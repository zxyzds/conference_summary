    "title": "Enhanced Diffusion Sampling via Extrapolation with Multiple ODE Solutions",
    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), while effective in generating high-quality samples, often suffer from high computational costs due to the iterative sampling process. To address this, we propose an enhanced ODE-based sampling method for DPMs inspired by Richardson extrapolation, which has been shown to reduce numerical error and improve convergence rates. Our method, termed RX-DPM, utilizes numerical solutions obtained over multiple denoising steps, leveraging the multiple ODE solutions to extrapolate the denoised prediction in DPMs. This signi\ufb01cantly enhances the accuracy of estimations for the \ufb01nal sample while preserving the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Unlike standard Richardson extrapolation, which assumes uniform discretization of the time grid, we have developed a more general formulation tailored to arbitrary time step scheduling, guided by the local truncation error derived from a baseline sampling method. The simplicity of our approach facilitates accurate estimation of numerical solutions without additional computational overhead, and allows for seamless and convenient integration into various DPMs and solvers. Additionally, RX-DPM provides explicit error estimates, effectively illustrating the faster convergence achieved as the order of the leading error term increases. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the quality of generated samples without requiring additional sampling iterations.",

                "value": "The work considers the problem of accelerating the inference of diffusion probabilistic models (DPM). Different from the distillation methods, the work adopts the ODE perspective of DPM and aims to propose an accelerated solver for solving the ODE associated with DPMs. The particular technique the work leverages is the Richardson extrapolation (RX), which is proven to achieve lower numerical errors given the same amount of iterations. Analogous to the RX in Euler, the authors derive the ODE solver for DPMs (eq. 22-23). Note that a rigorous mathematical justification of eq 22-23 is not presented, but a simple derivation of the truncation error in terms of total iteration number N is given (assuming eq. 22-23 to be true).\n\nTwo different experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of RX-DPMs. The first experiment focus on the RX-Euler case, which can be derived rigorously. The experiment clearly shows that RX-Euler leads to faster convergence. The second experiments focuses on RX-DPMs. The results demonstrate faster convergence of RX-DPMs than other DPMs, which, however, is not as significant as RX-Euler over Euler."

As pointed out in the weakness, the authors are advised to provide a more clear and rigorous justification of eq. 22-23.\n3. Some symbols are used before proper definition, such as $\\lambda$.\n\n---- Experiment -----\n1. [Fig.2] Please show the dimensionality of the images from CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.\n2. [Fig.3] The authors are advised to explain why not all algorithms start at NFE=0.\n3. A paragraph properly discussing the limitation of the proposed method is recommended. Besides RX may not be extended to SDE, another clear limitation of the method is the lack of rigorous mathematical justification.\n4. The current experiment does not include any other fast DPM methods. To help properly evaluate the performance, the authors are advised to compare RX-DPMs with either a distillation-model-type or consistency-model-type method."

Also the mentioned that one of the contribution is arbitrary discretization of time steps; however it is not clear if they have actually implemented it.   \n\n2. The experiment part is not well written either. It is ambiguous on the relationship between RX-DPM  and RX-EDM and RX-DDIM, \n \nI believe this paper needs a major revision before it is published.

I believe the local truncation error at line 196/197 in the right of eqn. (10) should not have the first term. Please check. As a result, if this is a mistake, it propagates into the following equations, and might cause major technical issue for this paper. \n3. From eqn. (13) to eqn. (14) to eqn. (15), in page 4, the function f disappeared, the only reason provided was because function f is smooth. I wonder if there is an error here. They could have used the Appendix to explain the soundness of this algorithm.\n4. The authors mentioned that eqn. (17) in page 5 is obtained from eqn. (16) in page 4; however, eqn. (16) has k in both subscript and superscript, one can not randomly set k =1 for superscript, and keep k in subscript; which resulting in two different values.\n5. It is unclear how the authors interpret DDIM as Eqn. (20). Somehow they jumped from equation (3) to eqn. (20) without explanation.\n6. In section 4.3, the authors first proposed an estimate of x_{t_{i-k}}, then jumped to RX-Runge-Kutta in page 4, when they mentioned they \"consider the second order Runge-Kutta ..\", but it did not mention for what reason to consider it. From the notation, I guess is they use to to estimate the truncated error. Then they jumped again into algorithm 1, in which they brought up ode solver \\Phi that was not explained before. The whole section should be reorganized and be rewritten so that the algorithm can be clearly explained. \n7. The paper should explicitly state that their proposed numerical solution is backward although it was time reverse in diffusion model.\n8. The authors only mentioned that \"We acknowledge that there are some\nlimitations to our method\u2019s application in SDE ...\". First of all, they proposed their algorithm for ODE, but they did not really extend it to SDE. Second, they did not state what is their limitation. Third, I would appreciate some discussion on the sensitivity of this algorithm as well as complexity cause by using the Richardson extrapolation because it is actually a more complicated way to calculate the derivative approximation."
