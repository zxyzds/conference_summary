    "title": "Spectral Compressive Imaging via Unmixing-driven Subspace Diffusion Refinement",
    "abstract": "Spectral Compressive Imaging (SCI) reconstruction is inherently ill-posed, offering multiple plausible solutions from a single observation. Traditional deterministic methods typically struggle to effectively recover high-frequency details. Although diffusion models offer promising solutions to this challenge, their application is constrained by the limited training data and high computational demands associated with multispectral images (MSIs), complicating direct training. To address these issues, we propose a novel Predict-and-unmixing-driven-Subspace-Refine framework (PSR-SCI). This framework begins with a cost-effective predictor that produces an initial, rough estimate of the MSI. Subsequently, we introduce a unmixing-driven reversible spectral embedding module that decomposes the MSI into subspace images and spectral coefficients. This decomposition facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained RGB diffusion models and focuses refinement processes on high-frequency details, thereby enabling efficient diffusion generation with minimal MSI data. Additionally, we design a high-dimensional guidance mechanism with imaging consistency to enhance the model's efficacy. The refined subspace image is then reconstructed back into an MSI using the reversible embedding, yielding the final MSI with full spectral resolution. Experimental results on the standard KAIST and zero-shot datasets NTIRE, ICVL, and Harvard show that PSR-SCI enhances visual quality and delivers PSNR and SSIM metrics comparable to existing diffusion, transformer, and deep unfolding techniques. This framework provides a robust alternative to traditional deterministic SCI reconstruction methods.",

                "value": "1. The novelty of this approach is limited, as spectral decomposition and refinement using pre-trained RGB diffusion models have previously been introduced in the spectral image restoration field [1].\n2. The method relies heavily on the initial prediction network. Although the authors claim robustness for the proposed framework, it may not perform well on unseen optical setups (such as different masks, noise, and number of channels). The framework depends on initial reconstruction results from a pre-trained CASSI reconstruction network. If the pre-trained network does not perform adequately on a new system with different optical settings (a common issue in CASSI reconstruction) the framework\u2019s effectiveness diminishes. For example, PSR-SCI-T (initial predictor: MST) and PSR-SCI-D (initial predictor: DAUHST) demonstrate this, with weaker predictors leading to inferior reconstruction results.\n3. The experiments presented are insufficient. The proposed method should be evaluated with recent state-of-the-art predictors, such as [2], DPU-9stg, and SSR-L. Additionally, comparisons with similar 'refinement' frameworks, such as [3], would further validate its performance.\n\n[1] Pang, Li, et al. \"HIR-Diff: Unsupervised Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Improved Diffusion Models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.\n[2] Yao, Zhiyang, et al. \"SPECAT: SPatial-spEctral Cumulative-Attention Transformer for High-Resolution Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.\n[3] He, Wei, et al. \"An interpretable and flexible fusion prior to boost hyperspectral imaging reconstruction.\" Information Fusion (2024): 102528."

Eventually, a diffusion model is fine-tuned to enhance the high-frequency details. There are three technical contributions:\n\n(i) Given the complexities of spectral unmixing models, a reversible decomposition network is introduced to implement spectral subspace learning while maintaining high reversibility.\n\n(ii) The diffusion generation is facilitated by low- and high-frequency decomposition.\n\n(iii) A high-dimensional guidance strategy is introduced for fine-tuning subspace diffusion, enhancing the effectiveness of guidance within the subspace."

The first stage of prediction and decomposition is like the embedding process of VAE and this process is highly reversible. Besides, using the frequency domain decomposition (low- and high-frequency) to facilitate the generation process is also very fancy. It matches the nature of spectra. It is very exciting to have this work in the community of SCI reconstruction.\n\n(ii) The performance is solid. As compared in Table 1, Figures 6, 8, and 9. The proposed method PSR-SCI not only outperforms the state-of-the-art end-to-end methods by large margins but also achieves better visual results. Compared to the SOTA diffusion-based method DiffSCI, the proposed PSR-SCI is 2.86 dB higher! It is great progress of the diffusion-based method in SCI. This work even contains the results of Pseudo-RGB on the RGB-to-HSI reconstruction task. \n\n(iii) The presentation is well-dressed. The figure of the pipeline looks clear. I can easily see the workflow of the proposed framework. The table of quantitative comparisons is also neat. The style of this table is from the series work of MST, MST++, CST, DAUHST, etc. I like it very much. The writing also looks good and easy to follow.\n\n(iv) Code and the reconstruction results have been submitted,"

                "value": "(i) Some modifications and explanations should be added. For example, why do you want to use an inexpensive predictor to produce an initial HSI instead of directly reconstructing the HSI results from the noisy measurements? Besides, since the process looks like the Stablediffusion - latent space diffusion. So I think it is better to discuss your work with it to highlight the differences and your contributions.\n\n(ii) The experiments are insufficient now. The ablation study only has a visual study (Figure 10). This is far from satisfactory. I suggest you add a break-down ablation like MST, MST++, CST, and DAUHST series works to demonstrate the effectiveness of each technical contribution. Or your claim of your work - the three modules are not convincing since their effects are unknown.\n\n(iii) The computational cost and memory usage of different methods are not reported in Table 1. I cannot judge the efficiency of the proposed method and compare it with other algorithms. I suggest you list the number of parameters and the floating-point operations per second (FLOPS)."

The paper does not sufficiently justify why this specific decomposition method is suitable for the SCI problem or how it leads to superior performance in terms of convergence speed, recovery accuracy, or error reduction. While the approach is innovative, its superiority over existing methods is not well-established.\n\n2. The claim that there is limited training data available for MSIs compared to RGB images is questionable. Recent works have utilized large-scale MSI datasets to train diffusion models effectively (e.g., \"HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation,\" https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470, https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene). This undermines the premise that data scarcity necessitates their approach.\n\n3. The proposed method appears to have a high number of parameters and computational demands. It is unclear whether the performance gains are due to the novel method or simply the result of using a much larger model compared to others. Methods like DAUHST and MST use models with millions of parameters, whereas the proposed method uses billions. This raises concerns about the practicality and efficiency of the approach, especially considering the longer inference times.\n\n4. Despite the innovative approach, the performance of PSR-SCI on the KAIST dataset is reported as 38.14dB PSNR, which is lower than some recent works that achieve PSNR values exceeding 39dB (e.g., PADUT [ICCV 2023], RDLUF-MixS2 [CVPR 2023], and \"Latent Diffusion Prior Enhanced Deep Unfolding for Snapshot Spectral Compressive Imaging\" [ECCV 2024]).

Does this affect the necessity or uniqueness of the proposed approach?\n\n4.
