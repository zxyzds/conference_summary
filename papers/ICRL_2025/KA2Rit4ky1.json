    "title": "PDETime: Rethinking Long-term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting from the Perspective of Partial Differential Equations",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of various approaches for long-term multivariate time-series forecasting (LMTF). Most of these approaches can be categorized as either historical-value-based methods, which rely on discretely sampled past observations, or time-index-based methods that model time indices directly as input variables. However, real-world dynamical systems often exhibit nonstationarity and suffer from insufficient sampling frequency, posing challenges such as spurious correlations between time steps and difficulties in modeling complex temporal dependencies.\nIn this paper, we treat multivariate time series as  data sampled from a continuous dynamical system governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) and propose a new model called PDETime. \nInstead of predicting future values directly, PDETime employs an encoding-integration-decoding architecture: it predicts the partial derivative of the system with respect to time (i.e., the first-order difference) in the latent space and then integrates this information to forecast future series. This approach enhances both performance and stability, especially in scenarios with extremely long forecasting windows. Extensive experiments on seven diverse real-world LMTF datasets demonstrate that PDETime not only adapts effectively to the intrinsic spatiotemporal nature of the data but also sets new benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art results.",

It\u2019s recommended to either standardize \\(H\\) across models or optimize it for all baselines.\n2. **Code Availability**: The absence of released code reduces the credibility and reproducibility of the results, as reviewers and readers cannot verify the findings independently.\n3. **Unclear Loss Weighting**: The weight description for the loss function in Equation 14 is unclear, making it challenging to understand the balance between different loss components.\n4. **Lack of Efficiency Analysis**: There is no discussion of PDETime\u2019s computational efficiency, such as runtime or memory consumption, which is essential for understanding its scalability and practicality for long-term forecasting tasks."
