    "title": "Advancing Portfolio Optimization: Hybrid Relaxation and Heuristic Approaches for Cardinality-Constrained MIQP Problems",
    "abstract": "The growing magnitude of investments in global markets has intensified the need for sophisticated risk mitigation strategies in portfolio optimization. Traditional portfolio optimization models that seek to minimize risk for a specified return frequently incorporate cardinality constraints, rendering them as Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) challenges. These constraints elevate the problem to NP-Hard status, complicating the solution process. While heuristic methods have historically been favored for their direct approach to MIQP problems, relaxation techniques offer a strategic alternative by simplifying MIQP into a more tractable Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. We first introduce an approach that facilitates the conversion of MIQP to QP by relaxing integer constraints into continuous domains and integrating integer conditions into the objective function using Lagrange multipliers. This dual application not only eases the computational burden but preserves the integrity of the original problem's structure. An innovative diagonalization technique applied to the covariance matrix further refines our method, enhancing the fit for integer variables, as Lagrange multipliers are inherently biased towards continuous variables. We present a comparative analysis of three distinct models, Linear, Dual, and Diagonal, each employing a unique relaxation strategy. Our research evaluates their efficacy in addressing the MIQP problem under cardinality constraints. In conjunction with heuristic methods, the refined solutions from our exact relaxation models serve as a starting point for further refinement using Genetic Algorithm and Neighborhood Searching Algorithm. This hybrid methodology yields results that not only rival but occasionally surpass those achieved by the latest models and the commercial solver CPLEX. Our findings endorse the potential of combining exact and heuristic techniques in portfolio optimization, marking a significant advancement in the field.",

I feel that the experimental results reported in Table 1 are flawed. How can the results of a heuristic approach be better than those obtained with an exact approach?

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Misinterpretation of Lagrangian Relaxation: The paper states that \"integer constraints\" are relaxed via Lagrangian relaxation. However, Lagrangian relaxation typically relaxed specific problem constraints rather than integrality requirements, which are handled differently in optimization. Upon review, it appears the authors have relaxed all constraints but not integrality requirements. Relaxing too many constraints in Lagrangian relaxation can result in overly loose bounds and challenges in finding feasible solutions. This oversight indicates a misunderstanding of Lagrangian relaxation principles, which is problematic given the paper\u2019s reliance on this method as a core part of its approach. Could the authors discuss the potential implications of their relaxation choices on solution quality and feasibility?\n\nLimited Discussion on Non-Smooth Optimization Challenges: Lagrangian relaxation operates in the dual space, where the convergence of Lagrangian multipliers is impacted by non-smoothness, necessitating careful step-size selection for stability. Non-smoothness of the dual function comes from the presence of integer variables. This is well-documented in the literature on non-smooth optimization, yet the paper does not address the challenges associated with non-smoothness or how they were managed in this context. Including a discussion of the stepsizes to ensure stable convergence, especially in the dual space, would strengthen the technical rigor of the paper. Could the authors address how they handled the non-smoothness issues in their approach, particularly in relation to step-size selection and convergence stability in the dual space?\n\nInsufficient and Outdated References on Lagrangian Relaxation: Given that Lagrangian relaxation is foundational to the proposed approach, the paper's references to it are limited and largely outdated. While older sources are often foundational, advancements in Lagrangian relaxation techniques, especially those addressing dual convergence and stability, are essential to understanding and enhancing the approach. A review of recent literature in this area, specifically regarding improvements in stability and bounding methods, would be valuable. The reviewer would suggest referring, for example, to the following recent paper: M. A. Bragin, \"Survey on Lagrangian Relaxation for MILP: Importance, Challenges, Historical Review, Recent Advancements, and Opportunities,\" Annals of Operations Research, Volume 333, 2024, pp. 29-45."

If so, what are the conditions under which convergence is ensured? If not, are there empirical observations on how often the method converges in practice?\n\nConvergence Speed in Dual Space: How fast does the algorithm converge in the dual space? Have you tracked or measured the convergence rate, and if so, could you provide insights on the number of iterations typically required to reach a stable solution?"

                "value": "The paper unfortunately shows major weaknesses, as I describe in the following:\n- Originality: as I explained before, the originality of the paper is very limited. At most, the diagonalization method could be considered as novel, but it lacks justification. The authors make vage claims like \"approach the solution better\" and \"some relaxations is preferred\" but they don't justify the intention behind the method. Please provide a more specific justification of the novely of the diagonalization method. Are there any examples or theoretical arguments that you can provide to back these claims?\n- There is no clear mentioning of the contributions of the paper. The authors claim that the work \"showcases a significant advancement\" but they do not clarify what this advancement is. There is no justification for advancing the practical application. Please provide a statement for the key contributions of the paper and specific evidence of how your approach advances the practical application of portfolio optimization.\n- Quality: the authors do not provide the source code used for the experiments. Most importantly, the authors compare with GA, SA and TS but give no details on what GA they are comparing with, details of GA, TS. For their own GA, the authors do not provide any parameters like population size, probability of crossover, the parameters p and l mentioned in section 3.2, etc. The results are therefore *non-reproducible*. I suggest the authors provide the source code for the experiments (including the specific values used for the GA) and the concrete details and parameters used for GA, SA and TS.\n\nFinally, the authors make more unjustified claims in the results section like claiming that \"our method has fewer outliners and thus has more stable results\". I guess the authors mean \"outliers\" and there is no hint as to what this could mean. Section 4.3 provides a comparison with CPLEX where the impression is that the authors compare with the optimal solutions. To my great surprise, the authors then claim to have found a better solution than CPLEX does. It is therefore unclear what the authors are doing here. Please clarify if the solutions from CPLEX are optimal and how the solutions calculated are compared againts the solutions from CPLEX. If the solutions are indeed better, it would help to discuss the implications for the use of CPLEX in this domain."
