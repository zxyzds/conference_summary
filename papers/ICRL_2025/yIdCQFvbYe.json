    "title": "Bayesian Learning of Adaptive Koopman Operator with Application to Robust Motion Planning for Autonomous Trucks",
    "abstract": "Koopman theory has recently been shown to enable an efficient data-driven approach for modeling physical systems, offering a linear framework despite underlying nonlinear dynamics. It is, however, not clear how to account for uncertainty or temporal distributional shifts within this framework, both commonly encountered in real-world autonomous driving with changing weather conditions and time-varying vehicle dynamics. In this work, we introduce Bayesian learning of adaptive Koopman operator to address these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian Koopman operator that incorporates uncertainty quantification, enabling more robust predictions. To tackle distributional shifts, we propose an online adaptation mechanism, ensuring the operator remains responsive to changes in system dynamics. Additionally, we apply the architecture to motion planning and show that it gives fast and precise predictions. By leveraging uncertainty awareness and real-time updates, our planner generates dynamically accurate trajectories and makes more informed decisions. We evaluate our method on real-world truck dynamics data under varying weather conditions\u2014such as wet roads, snow, and ice\u2014where uncertainty and dynamic shifts are prominent, as well as in other simulated environments. The results demonstrate our method\u2019s ability to deliver accurate, uncertainty-aware open-loop predictions for dynamic systems.",

I\u2019m not sure if the use of variational encoder to simplify online sampling is completely novel, but it would certainly be if this is the authors\u2019 original idea. Otherwise maybe more related literature discussion is needed. I\u2019ll leave this part to be answered by the authors and fellow reviewers during rebuttal phase.\n3. Some ablation studies may be needed. For example, BLAK without adaptation/bayesian learning. I\u2019d like to know how much of the performance of the proposed method comes from the transformer + Koopman, versus how much is from bayesian learning.\n4. Additionally the authors could compare design choices with recent paper on transformer for adaptive vehicle dynamics prediction/control, such as details of how state/action are tokenized, encoding/decoding details, etc. Such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15783, and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08674\n\nOther details\n1. Figure 1 caption is hard to follow. Suggest putting reference symbols (step A, B, C, etc.) on the plot.\n2.

It would be interesting to see how a one-step predictive method using a Bayesian neural network or Gaussian process performs.\n\nIn the appendix, the authors state that the data is collected using a TD3 agent.
