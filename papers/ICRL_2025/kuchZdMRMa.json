    "title": "Topological Data Analysis on Graphs: Euler characteristics, Persistent Homology, or Spectrum?",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are limited by the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy and cannot compute graph properties such as cycles. Topological descriptors (TDs) such as the Euler characteristics (EC), persistent homology (PH), and Laplacian spectrums have thus been employed to enhance the GNNs. However, despite empirical successes,  the theoretical underpinnings of these TDs remain largely underexplored. We bridge this gap with a rigorous characterization of TDs focusing on three key aspects: expressivity (representational power), stability (robustness to data perturbations), and computation (implementation cost). We evaluate the expressivity of different TDs, and  design a novel scheme that is strictly more expressive. We also propose a new metric to assess the stability of the state-of-the-art RePHINE method. To address computational costs, we introduce and analyze weaker variants for several descriptors. TDs find significant application in molecular contexts, so we also explore new  filtration functions on the molecular graphs. Finally, we formalize the properties of filtration functions derived from graph products. Overall, this work lays the foundation for the principled design and analysis of new TDs that can be tailored to specific applications.",

Overall, while I agree with the need for an unbiased and rigorous study of the effectiveness of topological methods in graph neural networks and I believe that this part of the study was carried out well, I am still not convinced by the place that topology has in graph neural networks and I am not convinced by the new contributions proposed in the paper, which in some cases, I see as straightforward extensions of existing methods.  Perhaps it is an artifact of needing to \"sell\" the new contribution.  I almost feel like the paper would have been stronger as a rigorous computational survey paper, systematically studying the strengths and limitations of topological methods, with a presentation of straightforward/obvious ways to fix the limitations.\n\nThe paper is also not very well written.

Definition 5 is the static version, but a persistent version is cited with Turner et al. being the reference.\n- Overall, I find the presentation of the topological descriptors studied confusing; it is not very clear to me whether the persistent version is being studied for the three types or the static ones, although the title of the paper and the introduction seems to emphasize persistent versions of all descriptors.  Why are persistent versions studied in particular and not static ones?\n- Should the authors choose to study static topological descriptors as well, I would be interested in what can be said about the Hodge Laplacian?  The kernel is known to encode geometric information about the homology of simplicial complexes (and therefore graphs as a lower dimensional special case); other eigenspaces do the same for graphs.  However, for the persistent version (which appears to be the one studied in this paper \u2013 again, not always clear...), only the kernel has been studied.\n- What can be said in addition to expressivity?  What about interpretability of topological methods?  For this point, I admit that my rating of \"soundness\" might be somewhat unfair, as I think this paper would be stronger as a review/experimental study paper (as mentioned in the \"weaknesses\" section) and I would be open to raising my score for this criterion.  Although it may be (substantially) more work, I still feel like it is a plausible question since in some instances, interpretability and expressivity can be seen as related, especially in considering topological notions."

The paper includes multiple, somewhat incremental findings that are loosely grouped under a single theme but lack a clear, unifying narrative. Each topic examined by the authors requires a much deeper, individual analysis; however, the paper only provides limited advancements in each area. Moreover, these results appear largely unrelated to one another, creating an impression of a collection of disjointed findings rather than a focused contribution to the field of topological descriptors in graph representation learning. I will address some points in more detail below.\n\n1. **Expressivity of PH or TD**: The expressivity of persistent homology (PH) or topological descriptors (TD) is difficult to define without specifying the space of filtration functions. Without this specification, one could theoretically achieve any level of distinguishing power between graphs by selecting suitable filtration functions (or colorings). Therefore, the current results lack meaning from a machine learning perspective, as they do not offer a robust comparison to graph neural network (GNN) expressivity.\n\n2. **Stability**: The stability result presented here is incremental, as it mainly builds upon foundational work by Cohen-Steiner (2006). There is limited novel contribution to the understanding of stability in this context.\n\n3. **Product of Graphs**: The purpose of this section is unclear, as it does not seem connected to the main theme of the paper. The motivation for ML and relevance to the other sections should be clarified.\n\n4. **Death-time Filtration**: The relevance of this section to the other sections is also unclear. Its connection to the overall analysis needs to be better justified. The authors derive several new notions and make comparisons between them. However, the motivation is again unclear.\n\n5. **Molecular Graphs**: Since this is an ML venue, I would expect experimental validation. Some experiments demonstrating the utility of the discussed approaches on molecular graphs would be valuable to illustrate practical implications.\n\n**In summary**, the paper discusses several interesting topics; however, it lacks focus and depth. I recommend narrowing the scope to one or two of these topics, accompanied by a much deeper analysis, with clearly defined goals and statements. This approach would lead to a more substantial and coherent contribution."
