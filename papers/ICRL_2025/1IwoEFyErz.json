    "title": "Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce *Shallow Diffuse*, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, *Shallow Diffuse* decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our *Shallow Diffuse* outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency.",

                "value": "This paper proposed Shallow Diffuse, a watermarking technique for diffusion models. The method is well-motivated and with proper theoretical justification. The proposed Shallow Diffuse has several key advantages compared to existing diffusion watermarks, 1) It is a training-free watermark but simultaneously maintains the consistency between watermarked and original images. 2) It is more robust than existing baselines, achieving nearly no performance drop under different robustness tests. Shallow Diffuse also considers two scenarios including the server (protect generated image) and user (protect existing image) scenarios for injecting the watermark."

                "value": "1. Shallow Diffuse's primary strength lies in its utilization of the low-rank property of the PMP's Jacobian matrix to minimize the visual impact of watermarks, thereby attaining visual consistency within a training-free watermark framework.\n2. The injected watermark is more robust against several image distortions than existing baselines."

                "value": "1. The presentation of this paper is poor, for instance, the ablation studies (Appendix C) and index of experimental results (Table 4) are incomplete. Therefore, this leads to a shortage of critical ablation studies.\n2. What is the performance of multi-key identification, specifically, is it possible for the Shallow Diffuse to inject multiple watermarks and distinguish between them?\n3. The image distortions are less than that in previous studies, such as Tree-Ring, where they apply 6 distortions.\n4. Can DiffPure purify the watermarked patterns?\n5. The findings in Table 4 are confusing. It appears that employing channel averaging enhances robustness against image distortions. However, channel averaging involves averaging clean and watermarked images across specific channels. As per my understanding, this process might reduce watermark robustness. Can you explain this observation?"

To show the proposed method actually preserves image quality, I think the authors should compare the method with some watermarking methods that watermark the image after image generation with a small perturbation.\n2. In the robustness part, I think the regeneration attacks and some adversarial perturbation should be evaluated on the proposed method to see whether the proposed method is actually robust under various attacks.\n3. Since the authors mention the user scenario, if multiple users rewatermark the same image with the proposed method, can the watermark embeded by the specific user be detected in this circumstance?"

The theoretical assumptions of the method are built upon [1], but the experimental results yield a different range of t values compared to the theoretical analysis in [1]. Although this can be explained by the errors introduced by DDIM-Inv, it remains perplexing.\n\n3.
