    "title": "Efficient Neuron Segmentation in Electron Microscopy by Affinity-Guided Queries",
    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of neurons in electron microscopy (EM) images plays a crucial role in understanding the intricate wiring patterns of the brain. Existing automatic neuron segmentation methods rely on traditional clustering algorithms, where affinities are predicted first, and then watershed and post-processing algorithms are applied to yield segmentation results. Due to the nature of watershed algorithm, this paradigm has deficiency in both prediction quality and speed. Inspired by recent advances in natural image segmentation, we propose to use query-based methods to address the problem because they do not necessitate watershed algorithms. However, we find that directly applying existing query-based methods faces great challenges due to the large memory requirement of the 3D data and considerably different morphology of neurons. To tackle these challenges, we introduce affinity-guided queries and integrate them into a lightweight query-based framework. Specifically, we first predict affinities with a lightweight branch, which provides coarse neuron structure information. The affinities are then used to construct affinity-guided queries, facilitating segmentation with bottom-up cues. These queries, along with additional learnable queries, interact with the image features to directly predict the final segmentation results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that our method achieved better results over state-of-the-art methods with a 2$\\sim$3$\\times$ speedup in inference. Code will be released.",

Having these available, would make it much clearer how the proposed method compares to the state of the art in a practical setting.\n- VOI advantage seems to be driven by VOI_split reduction at the cost of VOI_merge. If the mergers happen at the level of supervoxels, the results are in practice less useful for proofreading, where many systems do not make it possible to manually fix this type of error.\n- The model is quite architecturally complex, with different losses, modules, and an explicit affinity modeling branch."

This is not true (the authors are aware of at least https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0049-4, which they cite later; there also exist other approaches such as https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Meirovitch_Cross-Classification_Clustering_An_Efficient_Multi-Object_Tracking_Technique_for_3-D_Instance_CVPR_2019_paper.html) and should be more clearly discussed earlier in the paper. The proposed model is far from from the first approach that directly converts 3d EM images into a segmentation.\n- 0.08 mm^3 is a fairly specific number to quote as a \"typical size of studied volume\", and quotes a 6y old paper. It would be best to cite more works here, or just refrain from making statements about what is typical altogether. I would also suggest reformulating the comment about processing requiring \"130 days of runtime\", as this is highly specific to your specific cluster/hardware configuration.\n- How often does your algorithm generate disconnected components for the same predicted object? (Eq. 3 does not guarantee connectivity)\n- What's the motivation for predicting affinities and then immediately averaging them in Eq. 7? Why not predict a boundary map?\n- Does N_a in Eq. 8 vary between passes through the network? If so, how does that interact the number of learned queries -- is N_l or N kept constant? How is N_l chosen in your work?\n- Your method does not require block overlaps to generate consistent results. But wouldn't the additional spatial context help in making the predictions better? Have you explored this?\n- What are the error bars for your results in Tab. 1?\n- How does your network capacity (parameter count, FLOPS) compare with your baselines?\n- Your examples in Fig. 5 focus on dendrites with broken off spines. Could you please also provide a representative figure for axons? (perhaps in the supplement)"

It appears that the current neuron decoder is attempting to \"rescue\" the low-quality segmentation by AGQ in $M_{coarse}$. \n2.

The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as those referenced in [1][2]. Including these comparisons will provide a clearer picture of how the AGQ method stacks up against the most recent advancements in the field.\n2. Figure 1 (b) suggests that the proposed method relies on agglomeration operations from 'waterz' post-processing. This seems to contradict the claim of directly predicting segmentation results. The authors should clarify whether the proposed method truly bypasses the need for watershed-based post-processing or if it still relies on some aspects of it.\n3. The experiments presented in Table 2, while informative, may not be based on benchmarks that are widely recognized in the community. Utilizing more established benchmarks would strengthen the paper's findings and allow for better comparisons with other methods.\n4. The motivation behind the proposed affinity-guided queries appears to have similarities with modules found in other works, such as [3].
