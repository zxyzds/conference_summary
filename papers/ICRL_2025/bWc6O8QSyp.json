    "title": "SFi-Former: Sparse Flow induced Attention for Graph Transformer",
    "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional message-passing graph neural networks in many studies, especially in processing graph data with long-range dependencies. However, GTs tend to suffer from weak inductive bias, overfitting and over-globalizing problems due to the dense attention. In this paper, we introduce SFi-attention, a novel attention mechanism designed to learn sparse pattern by minimizing an energy function based on network flows with $\\ell_1$-norm regularization, to relieve those issues caused by dense attention. Furthermore, SFi-Former is accordingly devised which can leverage the sparse attention pattern of SFi-attention to generate sparse network flows beyond adjacency matrix of graph data. Specifically, SFi-Former aggregates features selectively from other nodes through flexible adaptation of the sparse attention, leading to a more robust model. We validate our SFi-Former on various graph datasets, especially those graph data exhibiting long-range dependencies. Experimental results show that our SFi-Former obtains competitive performance on GNN Benchmark datasets and SOTA performance on Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets. Additionally, our model gives rise to smaller generalization gaps, which indicates that it is less prone to over-fitting.",

The paper suggests limited prior research on energy-based models in graph transformers; however, existing work such as DIFFormer [1] and SGFormer [2] has explored similar energy-constrained frameworks.\n\n2. While the paper presents a theoretical explanation of its sparse attention mechanism, it omits consideration of the adjacency matrix and message-passing components in this framework. Many recent theoretical studies [1, 2, 3, 4] on GNNs and GTs employ energy-function-based models. Linking the proposed framework with established theoretical insights in this area would enhance the theoretical contribution.\n\n3. An additional ablation test excluding the friction parameter, while maintaining sparse constraints on Z, would clarify its specific role. Additionally, the paper could benefit from further discussion on issues of weak inductive bias, overfitting, and over-globalizing within the experimental results.\n\n4. The paper suggests that its sparse attention can replace attention modules in existing graph transformers. However, comparisons of model performance before and after substituting with sparse attention are currently not provided. It would also be beneficial to test if simple sparsity regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2, or entropy regularization) on attention coefficients in existing models achieve similar gains.\n\n5. The performance gains in the second experiment are minimal and within random variation, which may raise questions regarding the method\u2019s effectiveness on GNN benchmark datasets.\n\n6. Although the authors acknowledge that addressing GTs' computational bottleneck is beyond the scope, a brief analysis of the model's complexity and computational cost would be useful. This analysis would help assess the trade-offs between performance improvements and the associated computational overhead.\n\n\n[1] Difformer: Scalable (Graph) Transformers Induced by Energy Constrained Diffusion, ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] Simplifying and Empowering Transformers for Large-Graph Representations, NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[3] Elastic Graph Neural Networks, ICML 2021.\n\n[4] Interpreting and Unifying Graph Neural Networks with An Optimization Framework, WWW 2021."

While the abstract highlights the method\u2019s design to address \u201cweak inductive bias, overfitting, and over-globalizing problems,\u201d there is little follow-up or comprehensive experimentation to demonstrate these effects. Although a subsection in the experiments discusses reducing overfitting, the gap of 20%-30% remains quite large, and the authors should explain this discrepancy.\n2. The authors assert that their model learns sparser attention scores, yet no experiments (such as statistical analysis or case studies) are provided to verify this claim.\n3. Section 3.2 is difficult to follow. The introduction of friction in the context of electric energy is confusing, and the purpose of the \u201cSoft\u201d function design is unclear. \n4. Section 3.3 also lacks clarity. The roles of Z, R(X), F(X), and Z(R(X),F(X)) in attention, as well as the computation of this attention, are not adequately explained.\n5. In Table 2, the proposed method underperforms a baseline across most datasets. The authors should clarify the factors behind these results and specify conditions where their method performs better. Without such insight, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is questionable.\n6. There some typos in the paper.

The authors argue that their model learns sparser attention scores. But how the l1-norm can induce sparse attention is not well-explained. It seems that the sparsity is archived by a simple \"hard\" threshold. There is no experiment is to show the sparsity of the learned attention scores either.\n3. In Section 3.1, the authors model the attention with circuit. Thus, it is very confusing in Section 3.2 that the author introduce friction. Thus I challenge the motivation and interpretation behind the proposed method.\n4. In Section 3.3, how to compute the SFi-Attn $\\boldsymbol{Z}^{*} (\\boldsymbol{R}^h(\\boldsymbol{X}), \\boldsymbol{F}^h(\\boldsymbol{X}))$ is not clear.\n4. The ablation study is only conducted on three datasets. The authors are encouraged to show ablation studies on all the datasets. Meanwhile, the components show significant improvements on some dataset, while show little improvements on other datasets. The authors are encouraged to analyze this result. Beside, the sensitivity test on hyper-parameters is not enough.\n5. There some typos in the paper.

Can you provide more deep insights for modeling the graph structural data?\n2.  The combination of adjacency matrix and attention matrix seems to be not reasonable in Eq. 11. The values in the adjacency matrix can be much larger than those in the attention matrix when the target node only has a few neighbors. The Fig.4 also proves the above claim. We can clearly observe that each node has larger attention values on themselves than those on other nodes. It is not suitable for information aggregation on graphs.\n3.  The ablation study is insufficient. More ablation studies on other datasets are required. Moreover, the authors claim that all experiments are conducted based on the GraphGPS framework. Hence, I suggest the authors replace the original attention mechanism in GraphGPS with the proposed attention mechanism to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n4.  The experimental results shown in Table 3 seem to indicate that the performance of SFi-Former is quite sensitive to the values of hyper-parameters. Moreover, Tab 5 and Tab 6 also suggest that SFi-Former needs a very very careful parameter tuning. The authors even carefully select the batch size, learning rate, epochs and warmup epochs to ensure the model performance, which makes the model comparison not convincing.  Hence, I believe the gain of SFI-Former is much from the parameter tuning, not the model designs."
