    "title": "Diffusion Transportation Cost for Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in leveraging the Optimal Transport (OT) problem for domain adaptation, a strategy shown to be highly effective. \nHowever, a less explored aspect is the choice of the transportation cost function, as most existing methods rely on the pairwise squared Euclidean distances for the transportation cost, potentially overlooking important intra-domain geometries.\nThis paper presents Diffusion-OT, a new transport cost for the OT problem, designed specifically for domain adaptation. By utilizing concepts and tools from the field of manifold learning, specifically diffusion geometry, we derive an operator that accounts for the intra-domain relationships, thereby extending beyond the conventional inter-domain distances.\nThis operator, which quantifies the probability of transporting between source and target samples, forms the basis for our transportation cost. \nWe provide proof that the proposed operator is in fact a diffusion operator, demonstrating that the cost function is defined by an anisotropic diffusion process between the domains.\nIn addition, to enhance performance, we integrate source labels into the operator, thereby guiding the anisotropic diffusion according to the classes.\nWe showcase the effectiveness of Diffusion-OT through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating its superior performance compared to recent methods across various benchmarks and datasets.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel transportation cost function, termed Diffusion-OT, for the Optimal Transport (OT) problem in the context of domain adaptation. Diffusion-OT leverages concepts from diffusion geometry and manifold learning to account for both intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. The proposed cost function is derived from a composite diffusion operator that consists of three diffusion steps: within the source domain, across domains, and within the target domain. By incorporating source label information into the diffusion process, Diffusion-OT can guide the anisotropic diffusion according to class labels. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Diffusion-OT outperforms competing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on non-Euclidean data."

The composite diffusion operator involves multiple steps and may lead to higher computational cost compared to simpler cost functions. The computational complexity of the proposed method, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets, is not fully discussed.\n\n2. Theoretical analysis limitations: While the paper provides theoretical analysis, it mainly focuses on the asymptotic behavior of the diffusion operators. A more rigorous analysis of the convergence properties and error bounds of the proposed method would strengthen the theoretical foundations.\n\n3. Incomplete analysis of failure cases: Although the authors admit the limitation of the proposed method is its assumption that both source and target domains reside in the same space. The authors do not provide detailed analysis of failure cases. As a result, we cannot clearly evaluate the negative impact when applying the proposed method in the real-world applications where the domains have substantially different underlying structures. This could limit the generalizability of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. It is not new to introduce intra-domain geometry for domain adaptation. Intra-domain geometry has been widely considered in optimal transport and domain adaptation. For example, the Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy considers transport between two metric spaces, and intra-domain geometry is involved in the construction of the metric. This has been introduced for cross-domain applications, as shown in [a][b].\n\n2. Section 1 states that the weights in ETD and RWOT are learned, rather than directly derived from the data as in Diffusion-OT, which limits their applicability to deep learning. This statement is questionable. Intuitively, it is usually a good strategy to learn some properties such as weights or distance from data, which can adaptively extract geometric information involved in data and enhance the performance. Different from the learning strategy, the proposed method adopts a pre-defined approach to obtain a transport cost. The pre-defined paradigm may not obtain good performance if the adopted approach is not appropriate for real-world data.\n\n3. Section 4 states that unsupervised domain adaptation implies that both domains are supported on the same hidden manifold. This assumption is vague. Domain shift could come from different marginal distributions, different conditional distributions, or some other factor. What is the specific assumption adopted in the submission? A detailed discussion should be provided.\n\n4. The compared methods are out-of-the-date. Domain adaptation is an active area with many advances in recent years. It is easy to find state-of-the-art methods published recently as the comparison, such as (but not limited to) [c][d], which are also optimal transport-based methods for domain adaptation.\n\n5. The results on Office-Home are lower than the results shown in [c]. Does the difference come from a different backbone model? If so, it is encouraging to adopt a better backbone to evaluate the performance of the methods.\n\n6.

                "value": "**Concerns**\n\nQ1. As far as I understand the Diffusion-OT, the key difference between it and existing OT works is that Diffusion-OT introduces the composition of stochastic matrices, i.e., \u2018source to source transition\u2019, \u2018source to target transition\u2019 and \u2018target to target transition\u2019, to construct the cost function. However, it seems that there are no explanations on what special properties are ensured by the Diffusion-OT from OT\u2019s view, e.g., JDOT measures the joint distribution discrepancy, POT/UOT relaxes the strict constraints under severe shift scenarios. Some justifications are appreciated.\n\nQ2. Is the constructed cost function $C=-log(S)$ still a metric? Since the metric property is necessary to ensure the validity of OT. Besides, if it is a metric, which kind of discrepancy does it characterize (e.g., joint/conditional/marginal distribution discrepancy)? \n\nQ3. Prop. 1 shows that the diffusion operator $S$ can reflect the cross-domain discrepancy and intra-domain diversity from the view of LB operator. However, it seems that there is no guarantee that the proposed method can control the diffusion process, i.e., suppress cross-domain divergence and enlarge the intra-domain divergence. Therefore, it is hard to understand the learning process and the properties of the proposed method. Detailed discussion on the optimization and learning procedure would be helpful to improve the clarity.\n\nQ4. In the diffusion operator $S$, the three stochastic matrices are construed with distance-based kernel function on original space $\\mathcal{X}$, e.g., Eqs. (4)-(5). Should they be formulated in representation space $\\mathcal{Z}$? If so, are the representations considered variables under the optimization process? What are the learning principle and its intuitive goal for the diffusion operator $S$?  An in-depth analysis of the diffusion mechanism in the learning process is high expected.\n\nQ5. Though this work achieves improvements over some existing OT methods, the comparison seems insufficient. On the one hand, some advanced OT methods that have similar goals/ideas to the proposed methods are omitted, e.g., key-point guided OT [a], mask OT [b], and general cost function [c]. Especially, considering the label-guided graph construction in Eq. (11), it indeed has the same idea as the mentioned works. On the other hand, the experiment could be extended to larger and harder datasets, e.g., DomainNet. \n\n**References**\n\n[a] Xiang Gu, Yucheng Yang, Wei Zeng, Jian Sun, and Zongben Xu.
