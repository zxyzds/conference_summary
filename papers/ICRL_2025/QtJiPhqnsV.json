    "abstract": "Utilizing the sample moments of variable means within groups, we develop a novel closed-form estimator for blockwise correlation matrix of $p$ variables. When the block number and group memberships of the variables are known, we demonstrate the asymptotic normality of parameter estimators and establish the stochastic convergence rate of the estimated blockwise correlation matrix and corresponding estimated covariance matrix, without imposing any distribution assumptions. The method ensures positive semi-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix without requiring a predetermined variable order, and can be applicable for high-dimensional data. Moreover, to estimate the number of blocks and recover their memberships, respectively, we employ the ridge-type ratio criterion and spectral clustering, and establish their consistency. Extensive simulations and an empirical study of stock returns in the Chinese stock market are analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of our proposed methods.",

The approach is straightforward: data from the same cluster are pooled and averaged as a single observation.

Overall, the paper is well-written, and the proposed methodology has potential applications in various fields."

                "value": "Although the proposed methodology is simple and straightforward, I see potential for its usefulness in certain applications. Overall, my perspective on the methodology is positive. Below are some specific questions.\n\n1. This paper's idea is essentially simultaneous clustering and estimation of a covariance matrix. Such an idea has been studied in some recent relevant literature; see, e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]. I think it will be helpful to discuss this line of research for a more complete picture.\n\n2. The main theorem, Theorem 1, assumes that the group memberships for all variables are fully known. Later in the paper, however, these memberships are estimated through spectral clustering, which is shown to be consistent. I\u2019d like to highlight a potential issue: the consistency established in Lei and Rinaldo (2015) indicates only that the percentage of mis-clustered nodes converges to zero in probability. For Theorem 1's asymptotic normality to hold, the rate of convergence would need this mis-clustered percentage to decrease faster than $n^{-1/2}$ , which appears unachievable under current assumptions. Similar challenges are noted in references [2] and [3], but these works resolve the issue by establishing almost sure convergence for group membership estimation, which may also be necessary here. Please elaborate on this issue.\n\n3. What happens if the estimated $\\hat K$ is greater than the true $K$? Intuitively, it should still be ok as long as  $\\hat K$ is finite. For example, in [2] and [3], the group estimators are still consistent even if $K$ is over-specified. Can you at least provide some simulation studies to investigate this issue? This would certainly add to the applicability of the proposed methodology.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Su, L., Shi, Z., & Phillips, P. C. (2016). Identifying latent structures in panel data.
