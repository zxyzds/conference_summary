    "title": "S4M: S4 for multivariate time series forecasting with Missing values",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series data are integral to numerous real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and meteorology, where accurate forecasting is paramount for informed decision-making and proactive measures. However, the presence of missing data poses significant challenges, often undermining the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches that first impute missing values and then perform forecasting tend to accumulate errors, particularly in complex multivariate settings with high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we present S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling within the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to recognize and represent missing data patterns directly, thereby capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies more effectively. Our approach comprises two key modules: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM utilizes a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to perform accurate forecasting. Extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, highlighting its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. These results highlight the potential of our method for advancing reliable time series forecasting in practical applications.",

Can the authors confirm whether they implemented these baseline methods using official code or leveraged existing unified Python libraries, such as the Time-Series-Library [1] or PyPOTS [2]? It's important to note that data processing varies significantly among different imputation algorithms. Utilizing unified interfaces could help ensure that the experimental comparisons are conducted fairly. \n\n### References\n[1] https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library\n\n[2] Wenjie Du.

There is a plentitude of recent works solving irregular time-series forecasting in an end-to-end manner via ODEs, modelling latent dynamics or graph modelling.[1-5]. Furthermore, these papers provide a set of standard datasets for time-series forecasting with missing values, thus no need to synthetically make the normal regular datasets irregular.\n\n- There are a lot of standard methods missing, where one could do simply linear interpolation to use them in the experiments on which S4 is tested. For example, this work is not referring to important forecasting works like PatchTST or iTransformer at all. The results of S4M in Table 1, are way worse then the results of PatchTST (see Table at https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST?tab=readme-ov-file) that it may be the case that PatchTST with 0.06 missing values indeed outperforms S4M.\n\n[1] De Brouwer, E., Simm, J., Arany, A., & Moreau, Y.

However, for a top conference like ICLR, the amount of missing comparison to important related work is too high for recommending acceptance."

I would be curious whether your prototype bank is also useful if no values are missing.\n- Table 3: Do I understand correctly, that you are comparing: Prototyping Bank + Masking (i.e. having m_t in (4)) against only having the prototype bank? I would also like to see Only Masking, i.e. having the mask m_t in (4) but no prototype bank, i.e. replacing o_t with X_t. Is your prototype-bank really needed for irregular time-series forecasting?"
