    "title": "Harmonious convergence for confidence estimation in depth estimation and completion",
    "abstract": "Confidence estimation for monocular  depth estimation and completion  is important for their deployment  in real-world applications. Recent models for confidence estimation in these regression tasks   mainly   rely on the statistical characteristics of training and test data, while ignoring the information from the model training.  We propose a harmonious convergence estimation approach for  confidence estimation in the regression tasks, taking training consistency into consideration. Specifically, we propose an intra-batch convergence estimation algorithm with two sub-iterations to compute the training consistency for confidence estimation. A  harmonious convergence loss is newly designed to encourage the consistency between confidence measure and depth prediction. Our experimental results on the NYU2 and KITTI datasets show improvements ranging from 10.91\\% to 43.90\\% across different settings in monocular depth estimation, and from 27.91\\% to 45.24\\% in depth completion, measured by Pearson correlation coefficients, justifying the effectiveness of the  proposed method. We will release all the codes upon the publication of our paper.",

                "value": "1. This paper does not provide a good summary of the problems of existing methods. So, I can not figure out the motivation behind the entire design. As mentioned in Line 48 \"One challenge is addressing spatial misalignment of training samples caused by random augmentations\", but why I should overcome this point? In other words, I do not understand why we have to introduce \"training consistency\" into confidence estimation networks. I can not see any advantages of doing so over existing methods. The only explanation is in line 130 \"Although significant progress has been achieved, these methods fail to take the information from training process into consideration.\" Through these words, I can not understand the author's motivation.\n2. There are some missing related works for comparison (Bae G et al. 2022, Xiang M et al. 2024). But the most important is I need to know the Strengths between this paper and these existing determined confidence estimation methods.\n\n3. The proposed solution in the papers lacks theoretical support. In my opinion, the inter-batch loss is just a constraint that ensures the gradient is sufficiently small during the optimization process of the network. This is a simple modification of (Li et al. 2023) without corresponding explanations. And the ablation experiment (Table 3) also shows that the $L_h$  is the most important part of the whole network, not $L_c$.\n\n[1]  Bae G, Budvytis I, Cipolla R.
