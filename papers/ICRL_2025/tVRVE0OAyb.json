    "title": "Precedence-Constrained Winter Value for Effective Graph Data Valuation",
    "abstract": "Data valuation is essential for quantifying data\u2019s worth, aiding in assessing data quality and determining fair compensation. While existing data valuation methods have proven effective in evaluating the value of Euclidean data, they face limitations when applied to the increasingly popular graph-structured data. Particularly, graph data valuation introduces unique challenges, primarily stemming from the intricate dependencies among nodes and the exponential growth in value estimation costs. To address the challenging problem of graph data valuation, we put forth an innovative solution, Precedence-Constrained Winter (PC-Winter) Value, to account for the complex graph structure. Furthermore, we develop a variety of strategies to address the computational challenges and enable efficient approximation of PC-Winter. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-Winter across diverse datasets and tasks.",

                "value": "W1: Lack of necessary explanations. For example, the concept of precedence-constrained calculates DFS along the contribution tree. By definition, the contribution tree is just a tree split of the message-passing mechanism. There seems to be no difference in the fine-tuned multi-layer GNN message passing. In another example, the authors argue that we need a fine-grained distinction between whether a node is labeled. However, in section 3.5, the authors sum the PC-Winter values of all duplicates to get the final value. It is contrary to the separation of labeled/unlabeled, which goes back to the aggregation of graph neural networks. The absence of detail will not be able to prove the innovation of the design, which is not convincing enough.\nW2: Flaws in the experimental settings. Firstly, datasets only contain certain types. Please increase the dataset types to evaluate the adaption ability of PC-Winter, such as OGB (bioinformatics) and Flickr (computer vision), which also need to implement graph data evaluation. Secondly, the evaluation matrix may be biased. The authors propose fine-grained data valuation in this paper but adopt a relatively general matrix of the average. Please provide a more comprehensive perspective, such as for labeled/unlabeled classification performance, balanced accuracy (b-Acc), etc. Please see more details in the Questions part."

                "value": "W1: This paper introduces a concept known as a \"Level Coalition Structure,\" which represents a hierarchical organization, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, it imposes the constraint that, at the same level, the data are mutually disjoint. This property is also demonstrated in both Figure 1 and Figure 2.\nFor example, as depicted in Figure 2, node v_0 has three child nodes {w_0, w_1, w_2} while node v_2 has two child nodes {w_3, w_4}, suggesting that these two sets of child nodes do not share any common nodes. Nevertheless, it is typical for these sets of descendants to exhibit some overlap or shared nodes.\u2019\nW2: In this paper, as outlined in Definition 2, the duplication\u2019 referred to in W1 appears to be handled by decomposing it into distinct players, termed `duplicates\u2019. However, it remains unclear whether the Shapley value of the original node is simply the sum of the values of these duplicates, as the paper does not explicitly address this point. Furthermore, the correctness of this computational approach is not supported by any formal proof in the text.\nW3: In a unilateral dependency structure, a player's contribution depends on its ancestors, resembling the sharded structure setting in [1]. However, in [1], computing the exact Shapley value remains #P-complete despite the presence of the sharded structure. In contrast, the time complexity of PC-Winter, as mentioned in I.5, appears to be polynomial. This discrepancy warrants further explanation, as the paper does not clearly address why the PC-Winter approach would differ in computational complexity compared to the #P-completeness of the Shapley value in the sharded structure.\nW4: The paper does not present any experimental results to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed algorithms.\nXia H, Liu J, Lou J, et al. Equitable data valuation meets the right to be forgotten in model markets[J]. Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2023, 16(11): 3349-3362."

Please provide further evidence or proofs to support this assumption, as it is currently unclear whether this decomposition accurately reflects the original structure.\nQ2: Why can the computation of PC-Winter be done in polynomial time, whereas calculating the original Shapley value remains #P-complete? Further clarification and justification of this distinction would be helpful to understand the computational efficiency of PC-Winter in comparison to the traditional Shapley value calculation."
