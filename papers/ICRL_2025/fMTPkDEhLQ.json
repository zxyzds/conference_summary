    "title": "Tight Lower Bounds under Asymmetric High-Order H\u00f6lder Smoothness and Uniform Convexity",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide tight lower bounds for the oracle complexity of minimizing high-order H\u00f6lder smooth and uniformly convex functions. Specifically, for a function whose $p^{th}$-order derivatives are H\u00f6lder continuous with degree $\\nu$ and parameter $H$, and that is uniformly convex with degree $q$ and parameter $\\sigma$, we focus on two asymmetric cases: (1) $q > p + \\nu$, and (2) $q < p+\\nu$. Given up to $p^{th}$-order oracle access, we establish worst-case oracle complexities of $\\Omega\\left( \\left( \\frac{H}{\\sigma}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3(p+\\nu)-2}\\left( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\\right)^\\frac{2(q-p-\\nu)}{q(3(p+\\nu)-2)}\\right)$ in the first case with an $\\ell_\\infty$-ball-truncated-Gaussian smoothed hard function and $\\Omega\\left(\\left(\\frac{H}{\\sigma}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3(p+\\nu)-2}+ \\log\\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{p+\\nu}}{H^q}\\right)^\\frac{1}{p+\\nu-q}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$ in the second case, for reaching an $\\epsilon$-approximate solution in terms of the optimality gap. Our analysis generalizes previous lower bounds for functions under first- and second-order smoothness as well as those for uniformly convex functions, and furthermore our results match the corresponding upper bounds in this general setting.",

                "value": "This paper investigates the oracle complexity of minimizing high-order H\u00f6lder smooth and uniformly convex functions, particularly under two asymmetric cases: when the degree of uniform convexity $q$ is greater than $p + \\nu$, and when $q < p + \\nu$, where $p$ is the order of smoothness, and $\\nu$ is the H\u00f6lder degree. The authors establish tight lower bounds for these cases, generalizing previous lower bounds for uniformly convex functions with first- and second-order smoothness. They employ the $\\ell_\\infty$-ball-truncated Gaussian smoothing operator to achieve dimension-free smoothness for their hard function construction, providing theoretical insights into high-order optimization."

            "questions": {
                "value": "## Two inaccuracies\nI recommend to slightly revise the paper according to the following points:\n\n1) In line 168 it is argued that Gaussian smoothing is dim-free, whereas uniform (over an l2 ball) is not. I believe this might be wrong, since they are essentially the same. Gaussian smoothing is nearly the same as uniform smoothing over an l2 ball with radius $\\approx\\sqrt{d}$, since the distributions are nearly the same by concentration of measure. So it's just that the authors seem to be comparing a $\\delta$-approximation smoothing to a $\\delta\\sqrt{d}$-approximation, which clearly wouldn't have the same smoothing parameters. Is this the case, or am I missing something? Similarly, I believe the same is true for sofrmax smoothing, which isn't really dim-free since the approximation parameter has a $\\log(d)$ factor. So making is $\\delta$-approximate would mean that the smoothness constant is $\\approx\\log(d)/\\delta$, no? This is a milder logarithmic dependence as opposed to polynomial, but still not entirely dim-free.\n\n2) As written, the proofs hold for deterministic algorithms. The authors do not discuss what is the algorithm class their lower bound holds for, and specifically I believe their results hold for deterministic (or more generally, zero-respecting) algorithms. The first lower bound based on the Nemirovski max function should hold also for randomized algorithm (with a quadratically larger dimension) based on so called \"robust-zero-chain\" arguments due to \"Lower bounds for finding stationary points\" by Carmon et al., but these are not given by the authors. Moreover, the second lower bound based on in the Nesterov function is not a robust zero-chain so it shouldn't hold beyond deterministic/zero-respecting algorithms, if I am not mistaken. The authors should discuss this in their paper. \n\n## Additional question\n- What seems to be preventing a lower bound for the symmetric $q=p+\\nu$ case? Why do both proof techniques break? It would be great if the authors discuss this in the paper.\n\n\n## Minor comments\n- Notation: $\\|\\cdot\\|$ refers to operator $\\ell_2$ norms, maybe should emphasize this (just adding the word \"operator\") to avoid confusion with Frobenius l2.\n- Lemma 1 (i) - the authors probably forgot to assume the function is $L$-Lipschitz."

I was wondering if there was a reason for this, as it is not discussed and in this setting $p\\geq 1$, therefore for me it is not trivial to remove it.\n\nIn several places in the paper there are potentially typos that cause me confusion both in the main part and in the appendix. More specifically:\n\n__Line 783__ $\\rightarrow$ you say $1/\\sqrt{d}$ is a truncated Gaussian, I think you meant to say $Z_i/\\sqrt{d}$\n\n__Line 230__ $\\rightarrow$ I think it should be Lemma 1, not Lemma 14 according to the derivation in the appendix as well.\n\n__Line 934__ $\\rightarrow$ You have a $\\beta^v$ appear in the first inequality, which is confusing to me does it not directly arise from the second inequality, where you use Lipschitzness?\n\n__Line 293__ $\\rightarrow$ I believe here that $x_t$ should be $x_s$.\n\n__Line 296__ $\\rightarrow$ Should the equality here be $\\geq$, since the way that $e_{\\alpha(s)}$ is chosen is for it to be the maximum possible that has not already been chosen.\n\n__Line 317__ $\\rightarrow$ Lemma 14 should be Lemma 1 here or am I mistaken?\n\n__Line 1011__ $\\rightarrow$ Similar to 296 it should be $\\geq$ or am I mistaken here again?\n\n__Line 1019__ $\\rightarrow$ I think it would be beneficial to reference Lemma 1 here for justification as the write up is extremely lengthy and it caused some confusion for me here.\n\nFor Section 5, I only have one question. Concerning lines 402,403, what do you mean by scaling of $\\tilde{f}$ and how does this imply directly that all of the properties of $\\tilde{f}$ translate to properties of $f$. This seems a little bit informal to me.\n\nI also found that there is at least one missing citation in the line of upper bounds for the case of H&ouml;lder Smooth functions.\n\n[1] Universal Gradient Methods for Stochastic Convex Optimization"
