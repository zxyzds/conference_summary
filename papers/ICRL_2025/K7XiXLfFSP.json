    "title": "$EFO_{k}$-CQA: Towards Knowledge Graph Complex Query Answering beyond Set Operation",
    "abstract": "To answer complex queries on knowledge graphs, logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge needs learning-based methods because they are capable of generalizing over unobserved knowledge. Therefore, an appropriate dataset is fundamental to both obtaining and evaluating such methods under this paradigm. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for data generation, model training, and method evaluation that covers the combinatorial space of Existential First-order Queries with multiple variables ($EFO_{k}$). The combinatorial query space in our framework significantly extends those defined by set operations in the existing literature. Additionally, we construct a dataset, $EFO_{k}$-CQA, with 741 query types for empirical evaluation, and our benchmark results provide new insights into how query hardness affects the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing dataset construction process is systematically biased and hinders the appropriate development of query-answering methods, highlighting the importance of our work. Our code and data are provided in~\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EFOK-CQA/README.md}.",

The authors introduce the EFO k-CQA dataset, which captures a significantly broader combinatorial space of existential first-order queries compared to previous datasets.

Is there any foundational reason this assumption is needed?\n* I am confused about the benefit of including the marginal metric. As you correctly indicate, it is flawed when dealing with multiple free variables. What is the benefit of still including it?\n * I wonder how a method like mpqe would work on your dataset. It naturally obtains representations for all variables of the query.\n* For the results of CQD, did you use the calibrated version $CQD^A$, or the original one? The calibrated one should be much more robust when computing on different query shapes."

The authors propose an end-to-end pipeline to generate EFO queries, sample answers, train models, and evaluate performance. The dataset is shown to cover 741 query types, aiming to capture a wide combinatorial space of queries.

The EFOk-CQA framework is a meaningful extension to existing CQA benchmarks, expanding beyond single-variable, set operation-based queries to include multiple-variable and complex query graphs. It also addresses a notable gap in CQA evaluation, offering a comprehensive benchmark that reflects real-world query complexity.\n2.  The paper demonstrates a high degree of rigor in constructing the EFOk-CQA dataset. The authors establish well-defined assumptions to exclude trivial cases, implement a pipeline for end-to-end evaluation, and provide empirical results with various CQA models across a comprehensive range of query structures and complexities.\n3. The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions and illustrations that help in understanding complex query structures. Concepts such as query graphs, grounding processes, and evaluation metrics are presented with detailed explanations and visual aids, facilitating comprehension.\n4. The EFOk-CQA dataset and framework have implications for advancing CQA research. By covering a broader range of query types, the benchmark could lead to the development of more generalized and capable CQA models. The analysis of model performance based on query topology and difficulty also provides useful insights for future CQA model improvements."

This might make it challenging to scale up the dataset generation process efficiently or to apply the framework to larger, more complex knowledge graphs.\n2.  The use of joint metrics to evaluate models with multiple free variables is valuable, but it is noted in the paper that joint rankings could lack reliability due to inherent difficulty. This limitation could affect the robustness of evaluation for complex queries, particularly when interpreting the rankings for CQA tasks."

Are there specific trade-offs in terms of time or computational resources that become prohibitive?\n2.  How often do the assumptions used to generate non-trivial query graphs (e.g., no decomposition) align with real-world query requirements? Would relaxing these assumptions reveal additional complexities or insights about query-answering models?\n3.  Can the authors provide an error analysis highlighting specific failure modes of the evaluated models? For example, are there certain query types (e.g., cyclic vs. acyclic) where models consistently underperform? This information could clarify which specific capabilities of current SOTA works require improvement."
