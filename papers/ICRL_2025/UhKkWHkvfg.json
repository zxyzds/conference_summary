    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to help pre-trained model bridge the gap between source and target datasets using only the pre-trained model and unlabelled test data. A key objective of TTA is to address domain shifts in test data caused by corruption, such as weather changes, noise, or sensor malfunctions. Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation (MM-CTTA), an extension of TTA with better real-world applications, further allows pre-trained models to handle multi-modal inputs and adapt to continuously-changing target domains. MM-CTTA typically faces challenges including $\\textbf{error accumulation}$, $\\textbf{catastrophic forgetting}$, and $\\textbf{reliability bias}$, with few existing approaches effectively addressing these issues in multi-modal corruption scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Multi-modality Dynamic Analytic Adapter (MDAA), for MM-CTTA tasks. We innovatively introduce analytic learning into TTA, using the Analytic Classifiers (ACs) to prevent model forgetting. Additionally, we develop Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) and Soft Pseudo-label Strategy (SPS), which enable MDAA to dynamically filter reliable samples and integrate information from different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDAA achieves state-of-the-art performance on MM-CTTA tasks while ensuring reliable model adaptation.",

The innovation is similar to adding a cross-entropy loss with pseudo labels on target data in regular classification tasks. It is unclear what are the main technical challenges in deploying test-time adaptation methods to multi-modality data.\n\n- Although the paper is motivated by the continual domain shift challenges, the proposed method does not specifically address the challenge of continual domain shift. The overall framework is more like applying self-training to a regression problem.\n\n- The adptation method requires access to source domain data which does not comply with the existing definitions of test-time adaptation or test-time training.\n\n- The dynamic selection mechanism is quite disconnected to the context. I can hardly understand how the dynamic selection mechanism is integrated to the ridge regression problem.\n\n- The manuscript introduced too many subscripts to the notations. It makes the paper hard to follow.\n\n- It may not be necessary to present the closed-form solution to ridge regression with a Threorem. The derivation of closed-form solution is well-known."

The running time of the proposed method on the model is also an important part of verifying the superiority of the method. Please supplement the running time of existing methods and all proposed methods in different models to verify whether the method can quickly fine tune and adjust the model.\n4. Regarding the content of section 3.3, it still needs to be discussed whether the proposed scenario assumptions and parameter (theta) are consistent with real scenarios.\n5. The complexity of the model has not been analyzed, and dynamic selection and soft pseudo labeling strategies may require high computational resources.\n6. In the experimental section, only two datasets were used as experimental results to analyze whether the analysis is reliable, and whether there are other similar methods for MM-CTTA that can be compared."

In the MM-CTTA setup, pre-trained models are adapted in an online fashion to corrupted, multi-modal data (e.g., audio, video) without requiring access to original, labeled training data. The core idea in MDAA is its use of analytic classifiers - linear classifiers trained through recursive least squares that effectively store autocorrelation matrices in memory. This approach allows MDAA to retain essential knowledge from the original training data while adapting to ongoing data shifts. To further enhance adaptation, the paper introduces a Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) that dynamically identifies and prioritizes reliable samples, ensuring that updates are informed by high-quality data. Additionally, a Soft Pseudo-label Strategy (SPS) refines pseudo-labels by assigning weighted probabilities across the top-k label predictions, rather than relying on one-hot labels, thus improving the model\u2019s robustness to noisy labels.\n\nThe paper performs experiments on two datasets, Kinetics50-C and VGGSound-C, across a range of corruption types. MDAA is tested against state-of-the-art methods in both single-modality corruption and interleaved multi-modal corruption scenarios, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness."

It would be useful to see a comparison of the source model performance when trained with cross-entropy loss versus least squares loss. \n\n2. The formulation restricts adaptation only to the classification layer. It has been shown in [1] how adapting the encoders themselves can improve performance. While [1] requires knowledge of which modality is corrupted, it would be informative to know what is the drop in performance due to this compromise.\n\n3. The choice of leader network in DSM seems arbitrary in the absence of experiments which validate the choice. For example, how does choosing the lowest entropy network work? Furthermore, how what is the frequency of updates using DSM? These questions need to be clarified.\n\n[1] Lei, Jixiang, and Franz Pernkopf. \"Two-level test-time adaptation in multimodal learning.\" ICML 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild. 2024."
