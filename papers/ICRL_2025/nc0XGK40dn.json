    "title": "Never Forget the Basics: In-distribution Knowledge Retention for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Human Motion Prediction",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to addressing the underexplored challenge of human pose prediction in dynamic target domains that simultaneously contain in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) techniques predominantly focus on OOD data, neglecting the fact that ID data, which closely resembles the training distribution, is often encountered during real-world deployment, leading to significant degradation in ID performance. To address this, we introduce In-Distribution Knowledge Retention (IDKR), a continual TTA framework designed to preserve critical knowledge about ID data while adapting to unseen OOD sequences. Our method introduces an ID-informative subgraph learning strategy that leverages the structural characteristics of human skeletal data to compute a structural graph Fisher Information Matrix (SG-FIM). Unlike prior work, IDKR simultaneously considers both node and edge features in the skeletal graph, with edge features, representing the invariant bone lengths between parent-child joint pairs, being essential for maintaining structural consistency across poses. These edge features are key to extracting reliable SG-FIM parameters, enabling the model to retain parameters critical for ID performance while selectively updating those needed for OOD adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDKR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving mixed ID and OOD data, setting a new standard for robust human pose prediction in dynamic environments.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach to Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for human pose prediction that addresses real-world scenarios where both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) motion data appear in the deployment domain. To manage this dual data presence, the authors propose an In-Distribution Knowledge Retention (IDKR) mechanism, designed to retain crucial ID information while adapting to OOD sequences. The method leverages the Graph Information Bottleneck framework to extract the most informative subgraph for ID data, filtering out irrelevant elements and enhancing focus on essential structures. A Structural Graph Fisher Information Matrix (SG-FIM) is then employed to identify key model parameters that contribute to ID sequence prediction. These parameters are selectively preserved during adaptation through a regularization term integrated into the TTA optimization, ensuring robust ID performance amidst OOD adaptation. Experimental results indicate that IDKR outperforms existing methods in diverse real-world scenarios, underscoring its effectiveness and applicability."

Novel Framework for Mixed ID and OOD Data in Human Pose Prediction (HPP): The paper introduces a pioneering framework that explicitly addresses the coexistence of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data in human pose prediction tasks, a novel scenario largely overlooked by existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. \n2. Innovative In-Distribution Knowledge Retention (IDKR) Mechanism: The proposed IDKR mechanism is a standout contribution, using ID-informative subgraph learning combined with a Structural Graph Fisher Information Matrix (SG-FIM). This approach identifies and retains key ID-specific parameters while adapting to OOD data, ensuring that critical ID information is preserved during adaptation. This dual capability of adaptation and retention is a novel approach that improves robustness and accuracy in complex, mixed-domain scenarios.\n3. Extensive and Competitive Evaluation: The paper provides thorough experimental evaluations, demonstrating that IDKR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HPP models, particularly in non-stationary environments with both ID and OOD data. This strong empirical performance indicates the method\u2019s effectiveness and potential for future HPP tasks that encounter dynamic and evolving domain shifts."

However, the paper could benefit from more concrete real-world examples and specific use cases to demonstrate the relevance and feasibility of this framework. Adding examples of real-world applications where dynamically shifting ID and OOD data are common, would strengthen the justification for this method and better highlight its practical impact.\n\nThe concept of domain shifts is also somewhat underdeveloped in the context of skeletal data, where inputs are limited to pose estimates. The paper would be clearer with a more explicit definition of domain shifts, including measurable criteria for detecting these changes within skeletal data and an explanation of how these shifts affect model performance. Clarifying how the model differentiates ID and OOD data based solely on skeletal data, or whether additional information sources (like RGB image) would be beneficial, would help reinforce the proposed approach\u2019s robustness in real-world scenarios.\n\nAnother area for enhancement is in addressing the inherent variability of future pose predictions. Predicting future skeletal positions involves multiple potential outcomes, but the paper approaches predictions deterministically. To provide a fuller picture of the model\u2019s capabilities, discussing how the method might handle multiple plausible future paths could improve its applicability. Additionally, exploring the model\u2019s predictive accuracy over extended time frames and including a graph showing MPJPE across longer intervals would clarify the scope and limitations of the predictions. This would offer more insight into how effectively the model sustains accuracy over time, adding depth to the performance analysis.\n\nThe statements on Line 49 and Line 52 reference prior research developments but lack specific citations to support the claims. Adding relevant citations here would provide necessary context."

It employs a subgraph learning strategy and a Structural Graph Fisher Information Matrix (SG-FIM) to preserve essential parameters for ID data by leveraging the structural consistency in human skeletons.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper looks incremental in nature: there is limited novelty in the proposed HPP setting. The motivation of the paper seems to come from that fact that there is continuous change in the target domain. When a person performs some activity, it is fair to assume that the environment does not change drastically which may bring in significant domain shift (rain, fog etc.). Some plots in Figure 3 (S+- and C+-) seems to illustrate this.\n\n2. The fischer information matrix designed here is essentially able to act as a regularizer since it serves as a prior of human anatomy (ex: invariant bone lengths). Several previous works exist in Human Pose Estimation literature which propose strong priors to capture a plausible set of human poses. It seems FIM was chosen as a straight-forward choice - there is a possibility this method may fail in scenarios where there are significant pose variations/self-occlusons due to heavy reliance on just invariant features. In scenarios where poses vary significantly even within the ID distribution (e.g., differing postures or activities within the same subject), SG-FIM\u2019s reliance on just invariant features may lead to suboptimal adaptation as it overemphasizes preserving parameters linked to structural constraints rather than flexible, adaptive knowledge which is the main motivation behind any C-TTA setting.\n\n3. The loss terms in 9 and 10 don't particularly seem novel: test-time alignment of human poses based on spatial and temporal features is a well-known technique. I would like to see if this was introduced based on some specific enhancement in mind to complement the GIL Learning approach or just as additional regularizers between frames.\n\n4. The authors introduce specific setups like Setup-C+\u2212 and Setup-S+\u2212 to simulate mixed ID and OOD domains by including only 10% of the source domain data as ID in the target domain. However, these ratios look somewhat arbitrary - testing with different ID-to-OOD ratios would provide more insight.\n\n4. Typos present: 800.9 PCK@150 in Table 3.\n\nIf the authors can address some of these concerns, then I believe it would significantly increase the paper's relevance."

The authors mention that it is implemented by learning binary masks which are then used to mask the over the node and adjacency matrices. There is no mention of how binary constraints are imposed on these masks.\n2. In equation 3 the masks are learned by minimizing a binary classification loss where all instances have the same label - why will the masks be incentivized to learn anything?\n3. In relation to equation 3, the posterior of the subgraph $q(\\mathcal{Z}|\\mathcal{G})$ is not defined.\n4. Section 3.3 discusses Fisher information, but equation 4/5 calculate it w.r.t the inputs (node and edge features) and not the parameters. How do the dimensions match up? How exactly are these node and edge features calculated?\n5. The authors introduce two self-supervised losses which are weighted according to an exponential function, with higher weights for larger timestamps (or more recent frames). Equation 9 defines the time-weighted spatial loss which calculates the consistency of predicted bone lengths across frames - why does the timestamp play a role here given that bone length should remain consistent across time? Similar argument holds for equation 10. Overall the impact is unclear.\n\n\n**Clarity**\n\nI found the paper to be lacking in clarity.\n\n\n**Experiments**\n\nGoing from the setup $S^+$ to $S^{+-}$ and from $C^+$ to $C^{+-}$ the difference in performance is consistent for both the baseline H/P-TTP and IDKR. This implies that both methods are handling ID data similarly - is the claim that IDKR is better at mixed TTA valid?"
