    "title": "On-the-fly Preference Alignment via Principle-Guided Decoding",
    "abstract": "With the rapidly expanding landscape of large language models, aligning model generations with human values and preferences is becoming increasingly important. Popular alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, have shown significant success in guiding models with greater control. However, these methods require considerable computational resources, which is inefficient, and substantial collection of training data to accommodate the diverse and pluralistic nature of human preferences, which is impractical. These limitations significantly constrain the scope and efficacy of both task-specific and general preference alignment methods. In this work, we introduce On-the-fly Preference Alignment via Principle-Guided Decoding (OPAD) to directly align\nmodel outputs with human preferences during inference, eliminating the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves first curating a surrogate solution to an otherwise infeasible optimization problem and then designing a principle-guided reward function based on this surrogate. The final decoding policy is derived by maximizing this customized reward, which exploits the discrepancy between the\nconstrained policy and its unconstrained counterpart. OPAD directly modifies the model\u2019s predictions during inference, ensuring principle adherence without incurring the computational overhead of retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that OPAD achieves competitive or superior performance in both general and personalized alignment tasks, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

                "value": "This paper introduces On-the-fly Preference Alignment via Principle-Guided Decoding (OPAD), a novel approach for aligning large language model outputs with human preferences without requiring resource-intensive fine-tuning or retraining. Unlike RLHF, which rely on substantial data and computational resources, OPAD achieves preference alignment directly during inference. The method leverages a principle-guided reward function derived from a surrogate solution to an otherwise intractable optimization problem, allowing it to steer model predictions towards desired behaviors dynamically. OPAD demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness across general and personalized alignment tasks, often outperforming established baselines."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The derivation of the surrogate optimization solution relies on an overly strong condition, namely 'The constraint c aligns well with the data distribution $P_{\\text{data}}$'. In lines 214-215, there is a statement saying 'Direct optimization is infeasible since we have no access to $P_{\\text{data}}$'. However, the authors did not explain how to design principles without access to $P_{\\text{data}}$, and how to verify and guarantee this condition holds.\nIn fact, even if the constraint $c$ partially aligns with $P_{\\text{data}}$, it could still lead to bad alignment. For example, let $P_{\\text{data}}$ be 'professional medical advice', $P$ generate health-related statements with broad coverage but low accuracy, and $c$ be 'use formal medical terminology'. Maximizing $\\text{KL}(P_c||P)$ might lead to technically-worded but meaningless or incorrect medical statements.\nTherefore, the alignment quality of the principle is crucial. However, designing well-aligned principles without access to $P_{\\text{data}}$ seems almost impossible; at least a surrogate $P_{\\text{data}}$ is needed for guidance and principle evaluation. I believe the authors' experiments actually had access to $P_{\\text{data}}$ (i.e., we clearly know we're dealing with the harmless and helpful aspects of hh-rlhf), so the designed principles could be well-aligned. But this contradicts the assumption of having no access to $P_{\\text{data}}$.\n\n- The proposed method lacks computational efficiency, running twice as slow as standard model decoding. While the tuning-free approach eliminates training costs, these costs are typically one-time investments, whereas inference requires continuous computational overhead. This computational burden limits the method's practical applications. Additionally, I recommend including computational efficiency comparisons with other in-context alignment methods to demonstrate whether OPAD offers advantages over similar approaches\n\n-  For a paper focusing on decoding-time alignment, the Methodology section lacks both a complete description of the decoding steps and clear connections to the method overview presented in Figure 2, which reduces the paper's clarity. I recommend relocating the 'Relation with the residual EBMs' section to the later analysis and discussion portion, as it isn't a direct methodology description, and enhancing the method section with either a complete description of the decoding process or pseudocode to improve clarity."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Why do more steps hurt performance? Theoretically, global rewards are necessary because the text that aligns locally can violate principles globally. For example, for a medical advice principle, 'Take aspirin for headaches. Then take ibuprofen for fever.' While each 2-token window appears medically sound, this advice globally violates medical safety."
