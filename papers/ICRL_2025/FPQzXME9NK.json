    "abstract": "Sliced Optimal Transport (OT) simplifies the OT problem in high-dimensional spaces by projecting supports of input measures onto one-dimensional lines, then exploiting the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden of OT. Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been introduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree systems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information of integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost. Inspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree systems on OT problem for measures supported on a sphere. As counterpart to the Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon transform, with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging this transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive closed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain an efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the topology of spherical trees, the well-definedness and injectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally invariant distance between spherical measures. Finally, we conduct a wide range of numerical experiments, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning, to assess the performance of our proposed metric, comparing it to recent benchmarks.",

                "value": "The paper is a natural extension of sliced spherical OT to incorporate tree systems. The authors propose a topological space on spheres called spherical trees by connecting spherical rays with a common root. They then adapt Radon transform onto the spheres and slice the trees which is equivalent to slicing the spheres with trees. After showing that spherical tree are metric spaces, the authors followed classic approach of adapting the OT computation in the tree-sliced spheres. They provided comprehensive theoretical and empirical results to support their theories."

Although I understand that the authors have provided extensive runtime comparisons, I would like to see the scalability of the method on higher-dimensional tasks beyond CIFAR, MNIST, and similar datasets.\n\n* The effectiveness of STSW relies on the quality of sampled spherical trees, which introduces variability in metric accuracy. If the sampling process fails to capture diverse spherical structures adequately, STSW\u2019s results might be inconsistent, especially in complex distributions where more refined tree structures are necessary.
