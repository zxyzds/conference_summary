    "title": "MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a speculative decoding technique designed to enhance throughput and reduce latency in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing a common bottleneck in high-batch, memory-bound inference tasks. By optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache through sparse KV configurations and employing self-speculation, the method improves memory efficiency, making speculative decoding effective for large batch sizes and moderate-to-long sequence lengths. Empirical results on high-performance GPUs, such as A100s and H100s, show up to a 2.51x speedup compared to traditional autoregressive decoding, especially in scenarios with long sequences benchmarking. While promising, the approach lacks comparisons of some baselines, evaluating a limited spectrum of model sets, lack of case study or worse case analysis, and lacks a discussion of the scope/limitation section. If the authors could address the concerns in revision, I would be willing to raise the score."

                "value": "1. Missing discussion and comparisons of reasonable baselines. Although the authors briefly discuss TriForce, which demonstrates the effectiveness of self-speculation with compressed KV, they did not compare it with TriForce in experimentation for some reasons. Besides, there exists some self-speculation work aiming to accelerate LLM inference, e.g.,  Xia et al. [1] and Zhang et al. [2]. Could such existing works be applicable to / integrated with the proposed solution? Please either provide satisfactory reasons why forgiving such baselines or add comparisons in experiments and clear this work's novelty. While the paper references approaches like vLLM, it lacks a side-by-side comparison, especially regarding memory efficiency versus other batch-processing strategies. Including metrics from existing solutions in similar conditions would solidify the paper\u2019s contributions.\n\n[1] SWIFT: ON-THE-FLY SELF-SPECULATIVE DECODING FOR LLM INFERENCE ACCELERATION\n\n[2] Draft & Verify: Lossless Large Language Model Acceleration via Self-Speculative Decoding\n\n2. Evaluation of a limited spectrum of models. The experimental settings focus on LLaMA series models, yet the performance of proposed methods on other models remains unknown.\n\n3. Lack of Case study or worse case analysis. The paper describes handling variability in token acceptance rates during speculation, but it could provide more details on failure cases or worst-case scenarios where rejection rates could impair throughput significantly. This is especially important for practical deployments in heterogeneous batches where sequence lengths vary widely.\n\n3. Lack of discussion and limitation. Providing a brief discussion of limitations would help clear the scope of this work and make broader impacts. For instance, this work focuses on high-end modern GPUs, so the proposed solution may not perform that well on desktop/low-end GPUs, or even worse at resource-constrained embedded systems. Including tests on more widely accessible hardware (e.g., T4 or V100 GPUs) would demonstrate the method\u2019s practical viability across a broader range of settings. The authors could elaborate more directions in the revisions."

Have you considered additional draft model selection criteria that might further alleviate the KV bottleneck?\n\n## Comments\n### Comment on Lines 52-74 and Figure 1a\nIn the section describing how the \"KV Cache Bottleneck Enables SD Speedup Even For Large Batches,\" the authors assert that KV cache loading time increases significantly in long-context, large-batch scenarios, leading to a more memory-bound process. This serves as evidence for the memory bottleneck supporting speculative decoding at scale. However, Figure 1a appears to represent the combined \"KV load and store\" time rather than isolating the KV load time alone. Could you clarify what portion of this time is allocated to \"KV store\"? Understanding the distinction between load and store times would help validate the impact of the bottleneck more precisely.\n\n### Comment on Lines 203-211 (\"Expected Generation Length Per Step\")\nThe preprint by Timor, Nadav, et al., titled *\"Distributed Speculative Inference of Large Language Models\"* (arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.14105, 2024), appears to be highly relevant to your study, particularly in examining the regime where SD leads to either speedups or slowdowns based on the drafting latency budget.
