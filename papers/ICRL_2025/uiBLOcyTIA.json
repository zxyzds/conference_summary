    "title": "NEXTLOCLLM: NEXT LOCATION PREDICTION USING LLMS",
    "abstract": "Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility analysis and serves as a foundation for various downstream applications. Existing methods typically rely on discrete IDs to represent locations, which inherently overlook spatial relationships and cannot generalize across cities. In this paper, we propose NextLocLLM, which leverages the advantages of large language models (LLMs) in processing natural language descriptions and their strong generalization capabilities for next location prediction. Specifically, instead of using IDs, NextLocLLM encodes locations based on continuous spatial coordinates to better model spatial relationships. These coordinates are further normalized to enable robust cross-city generalization. Another highlight of NextlocLLM is its LLM-enhanced POI embeddings. It utilizes LLMs\u2019 ability to encode each POI category\u2019s natural language description into embeddings. These embeddings are then integrated via nonlinear projections to form this LLM-enhanced POI embeddings, effectively capturing locations\u2019 functional attributes. Furthermore, task and data prompt prefix, together with trajectory embeddings, are incorporated as input for partly-frozen LLM backbone. NextLocLLM further introduces prediction retrieval module to ensure structural consistency in prediction. Experiments show that NextLocLLM outperforms existing models in next location prediction, excelling in both supervised and zero-shot settings.",

                "value": "The paper presents NextLocLLM, a model designed to predict the next location by enhancing the extraction of spatial relationships and improving generalizability across different cities using a large language model (LLM) approach. First, NextLocLLM employs normalized spatial coordinates to represent discrete locations, accurately modeling spatial relationships and bypassing location ID inconsistencies across cities. Second, the model integrates LLM-enhanced POI category information, which captures functional attributes of locations more effectively. Finally, NextLocLLM leverages a KD-tree to convert output coordinates into the top-k most likely predicted locations, thereby incorporating neighborhood spatial relationships into the prediction process."

Unlike other methods that rely solely on location IDs for prompt design, NextLocLLM focuses on spatial relationships and semantic embeddings derived from natural language descriptions of POI categories. By using spatial coordinates, the model gains a deeper understanding of spatial relationships between locations, enhancing transferability and generalization across diverse urban environments.\nS2. The authors conduct extensive experiments with various models and baselines. These experiments are comprehensive, covering four datasets and demonstrating strong performance in both supervised and zero-shot settings.\nS3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow."

Therefore, I am very concerned about the computational efficiency issues of the proposed method, including training and inference time as well as resource utilization. I hope that the authors can report on this point and compare it with baselines. It is acceptable that the computational efficiency is not good for an ICLR paper, but it is better to discuss the drawback (if have)"

In the conclusion section, the authors mentioned that the *geographical distance error remains a challenge*, and maybe further reducing the grid size can mitigate this? The current study used a grid size of 500m x 500m for location prediction. I would like to know how grid size affects accuracy."
