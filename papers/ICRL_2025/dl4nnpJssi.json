    "title": "Enhancing Graph Invariant Learning from a Negative Inference Perspective",
    "abstract": "The out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge is a longstanding problem  in graph learning. Through studying the fundamental cause of data distribution shift, i.e., the changes of environments, significant progress has been achieved in addressing this issue. However, we observe that existing works still fail to effectively address complex environment shifts. Previous practices place excessive attention on extracting causal subgraphs, inevitably treating spurious subgraphs as environment variables. While spurious subgraphs are controlled by environments, the space of environment changes encompass more than the scale of spurious subgraphs. Therefore, existing efforts have a limited inference space for environments,  leading to failure under severe environment changes. To tackle this issue, we propose a negative inference graph OOD framework (NeGo)  to broaden the inference space for environment factors. Inspired by the successful practice of prompt learning in capturing underlying semantics and causal associations in large language models, we design a negative prompt environment inference to extract underlying environment information. We further introduce the environment-enhanced invariant subgraph learning method to effectively exploit inferred environment embedding, ensuring the robust extraction of causal subgraph in the environment shifts. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NeGo on real-world datasets and synthetic datasets across domains. NeGo outperforms baselines on nearly all datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our source code is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NeGo-E4C1}.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a model to enhance OOD generalization in GNNs by leveraging negative inference techniques. The authors propose the NeGo model to broaden the inference space for environment variables in graph data, countering the limitations of existing positive-inference-based approaches. The NeGo model employs a negative prompt environment inference strategy, which draws inspiration from prompt learning in natural language processing, to capture underlying environment factors. This method enables NeGo to improve the extraction of causal subgraphs across complex environment shifts. The paper claims significant performance improvements over baselines across synthetic and real-world datasets."

I think the authors could address my concern by presenting more difference with related works clearly.\n2. There are a lot of works that study graph OOD in the survey (Out-Of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs: A Survey). The authors should include them in the discussions in the related works, and choose some representative methods for comparisons in the experiments.\n3. The theorems are present informally. I suggest the authors use formal math language rather than current imprecise expression, especially for the key concepts (including but not limited to \u201cbroader cognitive space\u201d, \u201cG_C can be extracted\u201d, etc.) in the theorems."

                "value": "1. In lines 47-53, the term \"complex environments\" requires clarification. In the provided example, the decline in test performance is primarily attributed to size shift, a well-recognized challenge. I disagree with the authors' attribution that this decline is due to the emphasis of current methods on extracting causal subgraphs.\n\n2. The statement in lines 135-136, \"Our approach, which represents a pioneering practice in utilizing negative inference, is distinct from all existing practices in this field,\" is inaccurate. EQuAD [1] also employs a similar paradigm that first learns spurious features before learning invariant features. This work, however, does not discuss or compare with EQuAD.\n\n3. In Section 3, the core idea of mixing various environments can be interpreted as environment interpolation. However, the linear environment mixing via latent variable $e$ may prove ineffective in managing extrapolated (unseen) environments. The claim in lines 233-235, \"However, we observe that such a goal cannot be achieved by existing methods,\" is inaccurate; previous works, such as AIA [2] and GraphSplice [3], address environment extrapolation and may offer a more effective alternative to environment interpolation.\n\n4. The objective in Equation 4 appears unusual. Specifically, minimizing the KL divergence using $P(\\bar{Y})$: it is unclear how utilizing the label distribution of extra-class samples facilitates accurate environment inference, as they appear unrelated to me.\n\n5. In the experimental section, the authors should analyze whether the negative prompter can truly learn embeddings in $A_N$ that accurately capture spurious patterns.\n\n6. The authors claim that the proposed method can resolve both PIIF and FIIF, regardless of the correlation strengths of $I(G_s;Y)$. However, the experiments are limited to the FIIF case, e.g.,GOODMotif, and all datasets assume $H(G_c;Y) < H(G_s;Y)$. Additional experiments on synthetic datasets are necessary to support this theoretical statement.\n\n7. The EQuAD method also employs a similar learning paradigm by leveraging spurious features for disentanglement to facilitate invariant feature learning. The authors should discuss and compare their approach with EQuAD. Furthermore, AIA and GraphSplice also aim to \"broaden the inference space of environments\" (line 71). A discussion or comparison with these methods is warranted.\n\n\n__References__\n\n1. Yao et al., Empowering Graph Invariance Learning with Deep Spurious Infomax, ICML2024\n2.
