    "title": "DHENN: A Deeper Hybrid End-to-end Neural Network for Highly Accurate Drug-Drug Interaction Events Prediction",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for therapeutic safety yet poses a substantial challenge due to complex pharmacodynamics. Traditional DDI prediction methods often falter for three reasons. First, they simplify dependency structures among entities (e.g., drugs, targets, enzymes, and transporters) in bipartite networks, falling short in modeling their high-order interactions. Second, the over-smoothing effects constrain the depth of the adopted neural networks, thereby limiting their learning capacity. Third, they mainly decouple the stages of representation and prediction, leading to suboptimal solutions that overlook the potential for ground-truth DDIs to refine embedding generation. In response, this paper proposes Deeper Hybrid End-to-end Neural Network (DHENN), which integrates a Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MKG) with a Prediction-Enhanced Cascading Network (PECN) in an end-to-end learning manner. Specifically, MKG captures higher-order relationships across entities, offering a holistic view of DDIs. PECN mitigates over-smoothing by incorporating shallow embeddings into deeper layers, preserving node-level diversity. The endto- end learning manner guarantees that the representation learning and predictive modeling of MKG and PECN are formulated into a unified learning objective. Extensive experiments substantiate that DHENN outperforms eleven competitors on two real-world DDI datasets.",

For example, C1=CC=CC=C1 for Benzene. And I don't know what does the authors want to do by putting two molecule graphs into drug SMILES and repeate it again. Is it representing $drug_i$ and $drug_j$? \n3. In the drug-substructures, it said the drug has a SMILES attribute \u201c986\u201d, what does it mean? That's so confusing. And also, the authors didn't introduce SMILES at all."

                "value": "-  Regarding limitation 1 (High-order interactions): DHENN utilizes a single-layer GNN, which only captures first-order relationships for representation learning. This raises the question of **whether it is genuinely more effective at capturing high-order information compared to other models**. Moreover, referring to \"high-order information\" as a significant limitation seems overly generalized, as this issue could be easily addressed by stacking multiple GNN layers to propagate higher-order interactions throughout the graph.\n-  Regarding limitation 2 (Oversmoothing): Given that DHENN only employs a one-layer GNN, **it is unclear how effectively the model addresses the oversmoothing issue**. A more convincing approach would be to experimentally demonstrate that oversmoothing is a problem for other baseline models (e.g., by comparing node similarity across embeddings from different layers) rather than making direct assertions. Furthermore, a similar similarity analysis should be conducted for DHENN to substantiate this claim.\n-  Regarding limitation 3 (Non end-to-end framework): Many existing methods, whether based on single-graph or knowledge graph approaches, are already end-to-end. Thus, it is **difficult to convincingly argue that this is a major limitation** in the current landscape of DDI prediction research."

Typically, KG-based methods also employ end-to-end node representation learning or feature extraction.\n- What specific modalities are used in DHENN to establish a multi-modal framework? It appears that molecular structures are not used directly but are instead converted into molecular fingerprints.\n- How are substructures extracted and selected from drug SMILES?\n- MACCS are typically 166-dimensional. Why does DHENN only utilize 13 MACCS features?\n- The necessity for neighborhood sampling in DHENN is unclear. In general, hetero-GNNs, similar to the one used in your model, often consider all neighbors to preserve the complete network topology.\n- Could you clarify the difference between Task 2 and Task 3?\n- The experimental settings for the non-end-to-end version of DHENN lack. Specifically, what was the optimization objective for the feature extraction component in this configuration?"

The authors should clarify the key differences between them.\n\nMotivation:\nThis paper proposes three motivations for the traditional DDI methods' failing short in the high-order interactions between biomedical entities, the limited learning capacity, and the decoupled learning framework. For the first motivation, this paper considers the relational semantics with topological structures as high-order interactions, however, some works have considered this information[2-5]. For the second motivation, I suggest that the authors elaborate on what the advantages of deep neural networks are for DDI prediction, and from the experimental results, there is no huge advantage of using deep neural networks over the previous methods. For the third motivation, these works [2-6] are all end-to-end methods for DDI prediction. I suggest the authors provide more evidence or analysis to demonstrate their strengths.\n\nExperiment:\nFor the baseline methods, many KG-based works [1-5] are missing. So the experimental results are not convincing. The authors can further discuss these methods and explain how your approach differs from or improves upon these methods.\n\nSome minor suggestions, the authors can provide more discussion on these.\n1. In the Method section, Equation (5) lacks sufficient explanation of the symbol, as the symbol \u03c3 is used without specifying the type of activation function it represents.\n2. The example \"986\" is used as a SMILES encoding for a drug, but it is not a typical SMILES sequence. A more representative SMILES sequence is recommended.\n3. The Related Work section mentions four categories of methods, but the main experiment\u2019s baseline selection does not include models from each of these four categories.\n4. The main experiment analysis is insufficient, only presenting results without in-depth discussion on the reasons for performance improvements or why it outperforms certain types of methods. There is also no analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of models other than the proposed one. The authors can provide more analysis.\n5. The descriptions of Tasks 2 and 3 in the experiment section are not detailed enough, and the overview and differences between the two tasks are unclear.\n6. Table 4 lacks an explanation, and there is no analysis of the experimental results for different combinations of the four entity types.\n\n[1] Wu, D., Sun, W., He, Y., Chen, Z., & Luo, X.
