    "title": "A Contrastive Teacher-Student Framework for Novelty Detection under Style Shifts",
    "abstract": "There have been several efforts to improve Novelty Detection (ND) performance. However, ND methods often suffer significant performance drops under minor distribution shifts caused by changes in the environment, known as style shifts. This challenge arises from the ND setup, where the absence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples during training causes the detector to be biased toward the dominant style features in the in-distribution (ID) data. As a result, the model mistakenly learns to correlate style with core features, using this shortcut for detection. Robust ND is crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging, where test samples may have different styles than the training data. Motivated by this, we propose a robust ND method that crafts an auxiliary OOD set with style features similar to the ID set but with different core features. Then, a task-based knowledge distillation strategy is utilized to distinguish core features from style features and help our model rely on core features for discriminating crafted OOD and ID sets. We verified the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimental evaluations on several datasets, including synthetic and real-world benchmarks, against nine different ND methods.",

At the same time, by identifying and distorting the core areas of ID samples through a feature attribution method for data augmentation, unnecessary correlations between style features and labels can be weakened. Minor improvements have been made to the knowledge distillation model part, updating the weights of the binary layer to enhance the teacher's knowledge."

The method uses a saliency detector to distinguish the content part from the style part in the input image, then applies strong augmentations to distort the content in the original image to generate OOD samples. A knowledge distillation network is utilized, where the teacher network consists of a frozen encoder and a binary classification head, and the student network is a fully trainable model. The student network is trained with a contrastive objective, aiming to bring closer the ID features of the student-teacher networks and to push away the OOD features. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

From the visualized illustrations, it appears that most core features are preserved even after distortion. I am concerned that treating them as negative samples in a contrastive objective might impact the performance of the ND model.\n2. In the student-teacher framework, features from different layers within the pre-trained ResNet networks are extracted for contrastive learning. It has been shown that different layers are associated with processing different levels of features; for example, early layers focus on textures and edges, middle layers focus on local patterns, and deep layers capture high-level semantic features. Within this framework, the ideal generated OOD samples should only differ in semantic features while retaining the same local patterns and other style-associated features. Therefore, I believe the framework\u2019s design is not sufficiently justified from a conceptual perspective."

This approach enhances the model's robustness by generating OOD samples through the identification and distortion of core features.

This adds significant detection costs and poses challenges for direct application in certain segmentation tasks, which may limit the method's practical usability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, while task-based knowledge distillation strategies have already been applied in some OOD detection tasks, the innovation of the proposed method is somewhat limited. The core idea remains focused on mitigating the impact of different styles on OOD detection. However, in real-world applications, variations in style as well as changes between ID and OOD categories can lead to significant fluctuations in performance. It is crucial for the model to accurately identify OOD categories not only under a single style but also across various style scenarios, such as sunny and rainy conditions. This broader applicability holds substantial research value."
