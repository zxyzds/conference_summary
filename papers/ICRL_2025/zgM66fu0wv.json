    "title": "IRIS: An Iterative and Integrated Framework for Real-Time Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data collection, redundant examination of known relations, and unrealistic assumptions. Additionally, while recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known causal relations, they fall short in uncovering novel relations. We introduce IRIS (Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of initial variables, IRIS automatically retrieves relevant documents, extracts variable values, and organizes data for statistical algorithms in real-time. Our hybrid causal discovery method combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover existing and novel causal relations. The missing variable proposal component identifies missing variables, and subsequently, IRIS expands the causal graphs by including both the initial and the newly suggested variables. Our approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution for causal discovery, enabling the exploration of causal relations from a set of initial variables without requiring pre-existing datasets.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The evaluation of IRIS focuses more on replicating human expectations than on accurately estimating causal effects. The \u201cground truth\u201d for the causal graphical models constructed by IRIS are causal graphical models constructed by a set of human judges. This has several problems. First, this form of evaluation eliminates any possible mismatch between the formalism (graphical models) and actual causal effects in the world. Second, it merely checks (at best) whether the human judges reproduce what an LLM can extract from the expressions of causal judgments in textual training data. This avoids a key question: Whether the training data of LLMs expresses accurate causal knowledge. One of the key goals of causal inference is to provide a source of information about interventional effects that is separate from expert judgment. IRIS appears to reinforce those judgments, rather than check them.\n\nThe authors appear to show *that* the method improves accuracy, but not *why* it improves accuracy. Until a mechanism is clearly described and proven by detailed experiments, the results are unconvincing. On its face, it seems unlikely that sufficiently accurate quantitative data could be extracted from large text corpora and that such data would improve the construction of accurate causal graphical models.\n\nThe authors describe the construction of cyclic models, but they do not clearly define the semantics of those models. The introduction says: \u201cSpecifically, this hybrid approach allows cycles in causal graphs, thereby discarding the *acyclicity* assumption.\u201d Accurate construction and use of cyclic models requires much more than simply *allowing* cycles. Instead, any use of cyclic models requires that the authors clearly define a semantics for cyclic graphs, as well as a corresponding semantics of inference in such graphs. They don\u2019t do this. Thus, it is unclear what their cyclic models mean, in a formal sense.\n\nA related problem is that the authors do not define a semantics of *temporal* causal models.  Such models pose additional challenges. One major challenge of doing this is to define a consistent time scale among the variables among which feedback occurs. In many real-world systems, some cycles of feedback occur in seconds and other cycles of feedback occur over days or months. These varying timescales have vexed many researchers who attempt to construct a useful semantics for cyclic causal models. The authors don\u2019t even mention this or other similar challenges (e.g., hierarchical dependence, aggregation, etc.).\n\nThe authors incorrectly claim to relax the causal sufficiency assumption because of the effects of the IRIS component that proposes new variables. In reality, IRIS's ability to propose additional variables doesn\u2019t relax the assumption. Instead, it makes it more likely that the assumption is met, provided that the added variables really are latent confounders. The authors should state this more clearly, and they should provide evidence in the paper that the added variables frequently correspond to latent confounders.\n\nThe authors do not provide evidence that the discovered variables satisfy necessary assumptions of causal graphical models. Variable definition is a major challenge of constructing such models. Specifically, variables in valid causal graphical model must meet a variety of assumptions, including the (quite challenging) assumption of modularity, also referred to as \u201cautonomy\u201d or \u201cindependence of causal mechanism\u201d. Any process that purports to automatically discover useful variables would need to show that the discovered variables are modular (at a minimum). There is no evidence provided that the discovered variables meet this (or any other) standard.\n\nThe authors do not appear to effectively address key challenges of extracting structured data from text. Automatic extraction of structured data from large text corpora poses a variety of potential pitfalls, including variation in the definition of units and variables, heterogeneity in the conditions under which data are gathered (resulting in more, rather than less, latent confounding), and biased sampling (corresponding to conditioning on a collider and thus posing a new threat to internal validity). The authors don\u2019t mention these threats to validity or how they address them.\n\nIt is unclear how the collection of data from documents is even possible. Essentially all traditional observational studies gather data from structured sources (e.g., national census data, surveys, etc.) rather than from text documents. For the example cited in the paper (\u201csmoking\u201d AND \"cancer\u201d AND \u201cpollution\u201d), it would seem unlikely that most text documents would contain specific instances from which useful data could be extracted (e.g., \u201cJohn Smith smoked 15 cigarettes a day for 25 years and lived for most of that time in Pittsburgh which had 15 parts per million of pollution during that period\u201d). The authors should make much clearer what sort of numeric data is appearing in documents and how it can be effectively extracted.\n\nOne writing issue interferes with effective reading of the paper. The authors provide citations without parentheses or other notation, making it difficult to separate citations from ordinary text on first reading. The authors should revise their citations to use parentheses (e.g., \\citep)."

                "value": "The authors gave evidenc that IRIS improved the construction of causal graphs as compared to previous LLM algorithms, but it is unclear from the paper why that is.\n\nThe paper is confusing about how value extraction works, so I may have misunderstood it. If so, some of the following objections may be incorrect.  The structured data that comes out of value extraction is placed into a d x n table, call it Table 1, where the number of variables is n, and d is the number of documents. For a given variable and a given document, the LLM is asked:\n\n    We have a variable named \u2019{var}\u2019. The value of variable \u2019{var}\u2019 is True or False.\n    True indicates that the existence of \u2019{var}\u2019 can be inferred from the document, whereas False suggests that\n    the existence of \u2019{var}\u2019 cannot be inferred from this document.\n    Based on the document provided, what is the most appropriate value for \u2019{var}\u2019 that can be inferred?\n\nIt is unclear whether the value extraction always forces the output to be binary. The prompt certainly makes it sound that way. However, the article applies value extraction to documents in which variables have 3 values, and makes it sound like it is supposed to extract the values of the variables. It is not clear why asking whether the existence of a variable can be inferred from a document would extract the value of a variable in that document. Or if a document said \"Flouride does not cause cancer\", whether it is possible to infer the existence of fluoride (or cancer) from that document. They report precision and recall for the case where the variables in the document had 3 values, so more information about what they meant by precision for this multiclass case would be helpful.\n\nThe value extraction was applied to the AppleGastrome and Neuropathic data sets. The AppleGastrome data set was created by using an LLM to create documents which were reviews of apples, where each document contained a description of the values of several features of an individual kind of apple, and whether the kind of apple was considered good. While IRIS outperformed another algoritm in extracting values of features in this case, this dataset seems very different from the kind of documents one would typically expect in epidemiology; those documents would not be descriptions of a single person and their attributes, so what the value extracted from such a paper should be is less clear. One thing that would help is to explain the AppleGastrome data looks like in more detail - I had to go to the original paper to get a sense of what the documents actually looked like.)\n\nThis raises the question of the use of the causal discovery algorithms on structured data. The structured data that is input into causal discovery algorithms in IRIS is very different from the usual kind of data the algorithms are designed for. In the usual setting, given 5 variables for example, a sample of units with values for those 5 variables would be measured, and the values of each of the variables for each of the units would be put into a table, call it Table 2. \n\nTable 1 and Table 2 are very different. Table 2 can have arbitrary values for the values of its variables, while Table 1 can only have True or False (if I understand correctly). I don't see how recording a 10 for how many years someone has been smoking relates to a True of False answer to the question of whether it is possible to infer from some document that smoking  exists (or precisely what it would mean to infer the existence of smoking from a documentt.) Causal discovery algorithms are intended to work on tables of the kind described in Table 2. I don't see how they could be expected to work on tables of the kind described in Table 1, if only because a great deal of information is being thrown away when variables that can have many different values are being forced to be binary. They also depend on data being i.i.d., whereas the documents may well be dependent on each other, if for example one documents cites another. Also the documents are being selected on the basis of the terms they contain, so that could introduce selection bias. If the values extracted are always binary, much information is being thrown away, which could also affect the causal discovery algorithms.\n\nIn the examples of applications of IRIS, while IRIS did find other variables to add to the original set of variables, there were actually very few confounders among the new variables. That implies that the causal discovery algorithms could be relatively accurate in these examples, but one would not expect that to be true in general. \n\nThe way that information about new variables is integrated into the causal graph produced by the causal search algorithm is naive. For example, a statistical algorithm might orient edges as A -> B <- C because A and C are independent. But if background knowledge indicates that A and C are causally related, there is now a conflict between the background knowledge and the current orientations (because if A and C are dependent, the evidence that the orientations are A -> B <- C is gone.) One should not simply add the edge A -> C, but also remove the orientations of A ->B and B <- C. Also if A -> B is in the DAG, and a new variable X is added by IRIS along with the informaton A -> X -> B, it is not clear whether the edge A -> B should also be removed. (A is a direct cause of B relative to the set of variables without X, but may or may not be a direct cause of B relative to the set of variables with X.) How should this be handled?"

However, the value extraction data here is aggregated from documents and lacks the context of natural experiments. The relationships identified among terms represent co-occurrence rather than causation. It seems unlikely that true causal relationships can be reliably uncovered from such summarized data.\n\n2.\tAssumptions of Causal Discovery Methods: Causal discovery methods require assumptions, such as acyclicity and causal sufficiency. When these assumptions are not met, strong justification is necessary to validate that the results remain causal. This paper appears to overlook these assumptions and does not provide evidence that the results are indeed causal.\n\n3.\tExperimental Results and Effectiveness: The experimental results indicate that causal discovery methods alone do not work effectively here; the highest-performing methods include Verified Causal Relations (VCR), suggesting that pre-verified causal knowledge is critical to success.\n\nThe experimental comparisons and conclusions raise further issues:\n\n\u2022\tIn Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the methods reported vary inconsistently. For instance, some tables include IRIS (Llama)-PC + VCR and IRIS-PC+VCR, while others list IRIS (Llama)-GES + VCR and IRIS-GES+VCR, and yet others have IRIS (Llama)-NOTEARS + VCR and IRIS-NOTEARS + VCR. It is scientifically unsound to selectively report results across datasets in this manner.\n\n\u2022\tThere are a total of 10 IRIS variations and 3 comparison methods.
