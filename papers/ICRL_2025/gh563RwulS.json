    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform binary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented, making decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin sampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing the characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines Meta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8\\% of the time.",

                "value": "This paper introduces Meta-Chunking, a text segmentation method designed to enhance the chunking phase in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The approach operates at a granularity between sentences and paragraphs by capturing logical relationships between sentences. The authors propose two specific strategies: margin-based sampling and perplexity-based chunking, validating their approach through experiments on 11 datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency."

The authors seem to overlook the fundamental discussion of why text chunking is necessary in the first place, and don't clearly identify the specific limitations of existing chunking methods. The significance of the chunking phase within the RAG pipeline deserves more thorough examination\n2. The logic behind Table 1 is somewhat questionable. Why weren't different methods compared using the same LLM? Additionally, there's an open question about whether the text chunking method might show more significant improvements with smallerLLM while offering smaller improvements to larger LLMs."

Given that the authors use PPL for document segmentation, it is uncertain how this approach is logic-based.\n- The paper only compares three baselines: original, Llama_index, and similarity chunking. However, as noted in line 267, LumberChunker results for other datasets are missing without sufficient explanation. Additionally, other chunking methods, such as proposition [1] and thread [2], introduce new approaches that are neither compared nor referenced in the related work.\n\n[1] Chen, Tong, et al. \"Dense x retrieval: What retrieval granularity should we use?.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.06648 (2023).\n\n[2] An, Kaikai, et al. \"Thread: A Logic-Based Data Organization Paradigm for How-To Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.13372 (2024)."

                "value": "- The details about the RAG system are missing, such as the number of retrieved chunks. The number of chunks incorporated by the LLM significantly affects performance. How would increasing the number of chunks impact performance compared to the baselines?\n- In Lines 200\u2013202, the authors state that \"high PPL indicates the cognitive hallucination of LLMs towards the real content, and such portions should not be segmented.\" However, high PPL typically suggests that the text deviates from the LLM's training corpus, so it is unclear why this would be considered cognitive hallucination. The method only considers PPL differences between consecutive sentences and segments when PPL reaches a margin, however, there are some misunderstandings about the author's claim.\n- According to Table 3, the threshold for meta-chunking is consistently set to zero, which implies that segmentation may occur after each sentence. With dynamic combination being a factor, how does this approach differ from simply splitting documents by sentence and concatenating them to the desired length?"

From my viewpoint, marginal sampling chunking is similar to a simplification of the mentioned LumberChunker, which both prompts LLM to find chunking points. The only improvement is the design of a simpler prompt to reduce the language capability requirement, which is quite incremental.\n\nFor the PPL chunking, the authors do not clarify their specific design to locate the chucking points, which are quite complex in (3), but they do not have enough explanation or empirical experiment support.\n\nThe experiment presentation is confusing, the authors enumerate a lot of language models but many of them are missed in the PPL chunker rows. It should be recognized with different chunking methods applied to the same language model. Also, the performance of prompt-based chunkers is highly influenced by the prompt design while the PPL chunker is not. Given the rather similar performance between the two paradigms, the advantage of PPL chunker is questionable considering the prompt selection\n\nThe writing is also problematic, the introduction does not clearly emphasize the reason why text chunking is important. As a relatively new field, the related work section is placed at the end of the paper, hindering the reader's understanding of this emerging field. Formulas are also not well defined like (1) and (3)."

For instance, stop words like \"the\", punctuations, and subwords like \"-soft\" after \"Micro\" will have very low perplexity, how will you handle such bias?\n\nCalculating PPL in your experiments does not require strong instruction-following ability, do you think language models before SFT can perform well as a PPL chunker?\n\nThe RAG performance is a synergy between LLM and the retriever, for instance, LLM with stronger long-context ability will favor larger chunks, how will your proposed method remain useful with the development of LLM ability?"
