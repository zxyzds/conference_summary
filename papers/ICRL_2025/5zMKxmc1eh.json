    "title": "OscillationInversion: Understand the structure of Large Flow Model through the Lens of Inversion Method",
    "abstract": "We investigate oscillation phenomena observed in inversion methods applied to large text-to-image diffusion models, particularly the ``Flux'' model. Using a fixed-point-inspired iteration method to invert real-world images, we find that the solution does not converge but instead oscillates between distinct clusters. Our results, validated both on real diffusion models and toy experiments, show that these oscillated clusters exhibit significant semantic coherence. \nWe propose that this phenomenon arises from oscillatory solutions in dynamic systems, linking it to the structure of rectified flow models. The oscillated clusters serve as local latent distributions that allow for effective semantic-based image optimization.We provide theoretical insights, linking these oscillations to fixed-point dynamics and proving conditions for stable cluster formation and differentiation in flow models.",

This refers to finetuning the flow model to align the velocity field of an inpainted image with the original image. This finetuning procedure is used to perform high-quality inpaining.\n\nFinally, the paper proposes a method for further quality enhancement: post-inversion optimization.

It would map back and forth between the noise representation and the latent representation. Therefore the finding of the oscillatory behavior is not a general finding about flow models, rather its something specific to this inversion process. \n\nThe paper does not provide sufficient evidence for its central claim: The images and their latent representation oscillate between local clusters. The paper claims this is the case empirically, but provides no experimental data. The claim also isn't justified theoretically or an intuitive reasoning given why that would be the case.\n\nLack of justification for methods. It is not clear where the training objectives come from and why the methods achieve the desired results.\n* Finetuned inversion: It is not clear why this training objective would induce more diverse oscillatory behavior in latent space. The paper lacks justification or experimental data that supports this claim.\n* Post-inversion optimization: It is unclear why this complex training objective is chosen over a simple fidelity loss with a MSE regularization term.\n\nPaper formatting:\n* Figure 6 is not legible.\n* Page 5 margin violation\n* Top of Page 6 odd figure spacing? \n* Table formatting does not follow ICLR convention."
