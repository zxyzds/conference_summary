    "abstract": "State adversarial perturbations \u2013such as sensor noise, environmental interference, or targeted attacks\u2013 are common in real-world systems, often leading to compromised state observations. Despite this, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in the context of State-Adversarial Markov Decision Processes (SA-MDPs) has received limited attention, primarily because conventional notions of optimality do not apply. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of optimality that ensures the existence of an optimal policy within SA-MDPs. Building on this foundation, we propose the State-Adversarial Max-Margin IRL (SAMM-IRL) algorithm, designed for robustness against state adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis, supported by empirical validation, demonstrates that SAMM-IRL significantly enhances IRL performance in adversarial environments, providing a robust framework for real-world applications that demand resilience.",

The authors introduce State-Adversarial Max-Margin IRL (SAMM-IRL), a robust IRL algorithm tailored for State-Adversarial Markov Decision Processes (SA-MDPs). SAMM-IRL adapts the Max-Margin IRL framework to handle these perturbations by leveraging a newly defined Resilient State Optimality (RSO). The RSO redefines optimality by focusing on maximizing expected values across initial state distributions under adversarial conditions. The theoretical foundation, supported by empirical results, shows that SAMM-IRL offers resilience in perturbed environments, maintaining robust performance compared to traditional IRL methods."

                "value": "My general concerns about this work relate to its motivation, novelty, and technical quality. I elaborate more on these below. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nWhy would one need to consider the combined problem of IRL with adversarial state observations? Although the authors motivate each of these challenges when treated separately (in Sec. 1), they do not argue why treating *both* is important. A use-case at least would give a better insight into the motivation. \n\n**Novelty**\n\nAs far as I understand it, the authors slightly modified the objective function of (Zhang et al, 2020) -- taking the expected return under initial state distribution instead of considering the vector value function -- to make policy optimization tractable. Then, they combine the SA-MDP framework with the max-margin IRL method  (Abbeel & Ng, 2004) to make it robust against perturbed states. Similarly, the theoretical guarantees are adapted from (Abbeel & Ng, 2004). \nI do not think this is very novel research since it combines existing concepts and makes them work together. To me, it seems a bit incremental. \n\n**Technical quality**\n\n- Some definitions are missing, outlined methods are presented as assumptions whereas some modeling assumptions are hidden in the text without being presented as such. Fig. 5 misses running seeds and a standard deviation error. \n\n- The paper lacks some positioning concerning IRL literature. The small number of citations says it all. There are many methods with variations of solving the IRL problem, and it would be worth elaborating on why these are insufficient if they are."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "- Even though the abstract mentions inverse RL, it would be worth describing the challenge of this setting (unknown/unobserved reward that must be inferred from close-to-optimal trajectories). \n\n- What is the motivation for combining IRL with perturbed state observations? Specifically, given that previous works have addressed the reward misspecification problem in IRL [1,2], why couldn't we reformulate this as an IRL problem for SA-MDPs? Say the expert policy is optimal for an unobserved $r^*$, but because of state-perturbation, the agent thinks the underlying reward is $r^*\\circ\\nu: (s,a)\\mapsto r^*(\\nu(s), a)$. Why not use out-of-the-shelf IRL methods under reward misspecification?\n\n - A definition of policies is missing in Section 3.1\n\n- In Eq (3), where does $\\pi_{\\text{E}}$ come into play? And the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$? These are defined without further reference in section 3.2. In that respect, 3.2 and 3.3 should be merged, as Algorithm 1 combines all the introduced notions. \n\n- In lines 114-116, why is the goal to find the arg-max? Why does it solve the problem of reward estimation? Does it have to do with MLE? If so, a clearer explanation should be provided.  \n\n- A reference is missing in Sec. 3.3 when describing max-margin IRL\n\n- In line 146, the hyperplane separation theorem is mentioned to optimize the feature expectation. Raising the fact that more than one policy can be optimal in a given MDP, how does the condition $\\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mu_{\\pi_{\\mathrm{E}}} > \\mathbf{w}^{\\top}\\mu_{\\pi}$ still hold for all $\\pi$? \n\n- Sec 3.1 does not assume any specific structure on the state-space. On the other hand, in Sec. 4, the perturbation set $B(s)$ is an arbitrary subset of $\\mathcal{S}$. This is a bit strange to me, especially if you want to be able to find the optimal perturbed state, you may need come compactness/convexity assumption on $B(s)$. \n\n- Assmp. 1 is not a theoretical assumption, but rather a modeling choice. Assmp 2 is also not, but rather outlines the methodology. \n\n- Defs 2 and 3 confuse me: Eq 11 is the believed expectation but on the other hand, the distribution matches with the random variable taken inside. This is not the case in Eq 10. The agent effectively observes $\\nu^*(S_t)$ so the designation \"believed\" is misleading. It is not a belief in the Bayesian sense. It is observed. \n\n- lines 306-308 assume that the expert policy is optimal under the optimal weight. This seems to be a strong assumption and should be at least presented as an assumption environment, because the optimal $\\mathbf{w}^*$ stems from the modeling choice of $\\max_{||\\mathbf{w}||\\leq 1}$ plus the fact that the true reward is linearly parameterized.\n\n- Typo in Eq 12? \n\n- Fig 5 appears before Fig 4 \n\n[1] Hadfield-Menell, D., Milli, S., Abbeel, P., Russell, S.

How does this apply to IRL? I would appreciate if the authors can expand on how they think about the relevance of the work.\n- The actual structure of how the adversarial perturbations enter the system is not very clear, and only covered late in the paper. Is the idea that the expert demonstrations will be perturbed? Or that the expert has computed the actions for the demonstrations under disturbances? If so, is the expert running any kind of adversarially robust RL algorithm?\n- The notation is some times confusing. Authors refer to adversary, agent, expert and observer, for different RL agents.
