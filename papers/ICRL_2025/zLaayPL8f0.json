    "title": "Decomposition Ascribed Synergistic Learning for Unified Image Restoration",
    "abstract": "Learning to restore multiple image degradations within a single model is quite beneficial for real-world applications. Nevertheless, existing works typically concentrate on regarding each degradation independently, while their relationship has been less comprehended to ensure the synergistic learning. To this end, we revisit the diverse degradations through the lens of singular value decomposition, with the observation that the decomposed singular vectors and singular values naturally undertake the different types of degradation information, dividing various restoration tasks into two groups, \\ie, singular vector dominated and singular value dominated. The above analysis renders a more unified perspective to ascribe diverse degradation connections, compared to previous task-level independent learning. The dedicated optimization of degraded singular vectors and singular values inherently utilizes the potential partnership among diverse restoration tasks, attributing to the Decomposition Ascribed Synergistic Learning (DASL). Specifically, DASL comprises two effective operators, namely, Singular VEctor Operator (SVEO) and Singular VAlue Operator (SVAO), to favor the decomposed optimization, which can be lightly integrated into existing image restoration backbone. Moreover, the congruous decomposition loss has been devised for auxiliary. Extensive experiments on five image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

It is noted that the deblurring case exhibits a relatively large area of damaged pixels, while the hazy and low-light image enhancement cases only show minor pixel degradation. What factors contribute to this discrepancy?\n\nThe authors conducted tests on underwater enhancement and sandstorm enhancement but did not include these results in Figure 1 & 2. Are the observations in Figure 1 commonly encountered across different datasets, including underwater and sandstorm? Moreover, Figure 2 is based on 100 images; Additional images should be tested to validate the findings. It is unclear whether only synthetic images were used to generate Figures 1 and 2, such as in the rainy case.\n\nThe assumptions regarding singular vectors capturing content information and spatial details, and singular values representing global statistical properties, are questionable. The authors should provide more supporting references for these claims. Furthermore, given that degradations are categorized into two groups, does the proposed method require prior knowledge of which group the degradation falls into before reconstruction?\n\nA clear diagram illustrating the entire blueprint of the proposed methods should be included to demonstrate how the SVEO and SVAO are integrated into the algorithm. The current description lacks clarity, particularly the statement about substituting convolution layers with SVEO.\n\nThe experiments primarily report PSNR results; however, additional metrics should also be considered to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.\n\nThe rationale for using the L1 norm in L_dec should be clarified.\n\nFigure 5 does not effectively illustrate progressive component reconstruction as intended.\n\nTypos in the abstract: 'tasks into two groups, , '"

                "value": "1. In Figure 2, the authors slightly show that the decomposed singular values \u200b\u200band singular vectors between different degradation types undertake different degradation information. Specifically, the exchange reconstruction error of Figure 2 (a) in the dehazing task is close to 50% for both singular value and singular vector, and the low-light and haze degradation in Figure 2 (b) are similar to other degradations such as rain and noise, while the blur and low-light in Figure 2 (c) are also very close. Therefore, I think that the authors don't explain the relationship between singular values \u200b\u200band singular vectors and degradation information well. The assumptions proposed are also untenable.\nThe authors could consider conducting an in-depth analysis in high-dimensional space or frequency space to analyze the impact of singular values \u200b\u200band singular vectors in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, frequency changes, etc. Even ablation analysis without using singular values \u200b\u200bor singular vectors can be used instead of just statistical analysis of reconstruction errors.\n\n2. The experiments only include results on a single degradation task dataset, not on a mixed dataset. This does not meet the requirement of using a single model for a unified image restoration task. The authors could refer to the similar experimental setup in the work of Li et al. [1] to conduct experiments on mixed degradation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DASL. \n\n3. The stability improvements brought by the loss curves of the training trajectories in Figure 6 and  Figure 7 are also not clearly demonstrated for tasks such as denoise and derain, etc. The authors should include the corresponding intermediate feature map changes or any other visualization statistics that can assist in demonstrating the effectiveness of singular values \u200b\u200band singular vectors.\n\n[1] Li, Boyun, Xiao Liu, Peng Hu, Zhongqin Wu, Jiancheng Lv, and Xi Peng. \"All-in-one image restoration for unknown corruption.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 17452-17462. 2022."
