    "title": "Reward-RAG: Enhancing RAG with Reward Driven Supervision",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Reward-RAG, a novel approach designed to enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model through Reward-Driven Supervision. Unlike previous RAG methodologies, which focus on training language models (LMs) to utilize external knowledge retrieved from external sources, our method adapts retrieval information to specific domains by employing CriticGPT to train a dedicated reward model. This reward model generates synthesized datasets for fine-tuning the RAG encoder, aligning its outputs more closely with human preferences. The versatility of our approach allows it to be effectively applied across various domains through domain-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate Reward-RAG on publicly available benchmarks from multiple domains, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance, highlighting the effectiveness of Reward-RAG in improving the relevance and quality of generated responses. These findings underscore the potential of integrating reward models with RAG to achieve superior outcomes in natural language generation tasks.",

For example, why their proposed method works better than re-ranking? In table 1, they mostly compare with older and smaller encoder models, and even in that case, their method only wins on the NQ dataset. \n\nIn table2, the base LM for RewardRAG is GPT40/chatgpt, and it is not clear how the RewardRAG model compares with GPT4 with the basic RAG model. Since RewardRAG's contributions are on improving retrieval, the authors should compare with the same underlying LM and varying retrievers e.g., GPT4o with their retrievers v.s. other retrievers (edited) \nIn Table 2, they compare RewardRAG with other models with different base LMs, for example Self-RAG is trained on a 7B and 13B models, and we know that GPT4o is significantly better than most 13B scale models. \n\nBase on Table 3, their number is much worse that GPT4o+standard RAG?

The reward model is not trained on the OOD data, so it is not clear how well it can generalize, and the retriever is not trained on the OOD data either. Could authors explain more?\n\n* Therefore I am not surprised that the OOD experiment is not good. The proposed approach performs worse than baselines in all tasks if the inference model is the same (i.e., GPT-4-0613; otherwise, the comparison is not fair). Besides, the authors should include more results of the proposed approach on different inference models to make the table more comparable.\n\n* Table 1 does not include OOD performance, so it is not clear how well the retriever performs on OOD tasks.\n\nOverall, I cannot be convinced that the method benefits OOD scenarios, although the in-domain claim looks sound and is supported by the experiments. Based on the current manuscripts, I will give a weak rejection.\n\nBeyond the above main concern:\n\n* It is suggested to have an analysis of the reward model: how well it aligns with humans (GPT) and how well it generalizes.\n\n* Though the current approach is sound, it does not bring much new insight and novelty."

I am not aware of the common datasets used to continue finetune retrievers, but having such a baseline will be helpful to  show the improvement from your method. \n\n* The same problem with Table-2. There's essentially no other baseline that is also built on \"E5-large-unsupervised \" and then compare RAG performance using the baseline versus your proposed method. I would encourage including a RAG baseline using another retriever that's finetuned on top of \"E5-large-unsupervised\" using common retrieval datasets. \n\n* The paper clearly needs more polishing. For example, the Table-1's first column should be Encoder models, not \"Task\", and the captions describing the evaluation benchmarks is confusing.\n\n* RLHF is means aligning to human feedback and preference, but the authors are in fact using a reward model for relevance. So, it's not very accurate, and I recommend changing it sth like contrasting feedback."
