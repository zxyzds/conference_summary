    "title": "Gaussian Head & Shoulders: High Fidelity Neural Upper Body Avatars with Anchor Gaussian Guided Texture Warping",
    "abstract": "The ability to reconstruct realistic and controllable upper body avatars from casual monocular videos is critical for various applications in communication and entertainment. By equipping the most recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation with head 3D morphable models (3DMM), existing methods manage to create head avatars with high fidelity. However, most existing methods only reconstruct a head without the body, substantially limiting their application scenarios. We found that naively applying Gaussians to model the clothed chest and shoulders tends to result in blurry reconstruction and noisy floaters under novel poses. This is because of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each Gaussian or point can only have a single directional radiance without spatial variance, therefore an unnecessarily large number of them is required to represent complicated spatially varying texture, even for simple geometry. In contrast, we propose to model the body part with a neural texture that consists of coarse and pose-dependent fine colors. To properly render the body texture for each view and pose without accurate geometry nor UV mapping, we optimize another sparse set of Gaussians as anchors that constrain the neural warping field that maps image plane coordinates to the texture space. We demonstrate that Gaussian Head & Shoulders can fit the high-frequency details on the clothed upper body with high fidelity and potentially improve the accuracy and fidelity of the head region. We evaluate our method with casual phone-captured and internet videos and show our method archives superior reconstruction quality and robustness in both self and cross reenactment tasks. To fully utilize the efficient rendering speed of Gaussian splatting, we additionally propose an accelerated inference method of our trained model without Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) queries and reach a stable rendering speed of around 130 FPS for any subjects.",

The head is represented by a set of 3D Gaussians while the shoulders are represented by a neural texture map. The gaussians on the head are deformed from the canonical space using Linear Blend Skinning while the texture-map for the shoulders are warped using a pose dependent MLP. Once in the deformed space, both the neural textures and the gaussians are rendered to yield the final image. The properties of the gaussians and the warpings are learnt through a set of RGB and deformation based losses. The neural texture warping is specifically constrained through an anchor loss defined using a set of Gaussians learnt on the shoulders. Both quantitative and qualitative show improvements over prior work."

Real3D-Portrait, which uses FOMM for the shoulder motion reenactment and finally merge the face motion and shoulder motion together. \n  b. StyleAvatar, a 2D human face rendering technique which includes the face, shoulder and background together\n\nThe author did not include these two into the comparison. Is it possible to compare with this pipepile with FOMM/TPS-based methods used in Read3D-Portrait / Torso NeRFs used previously in GeneFace to see whether this method is more effective? In addition, using neural texture as an whole image enhancement method is also covered in StyleAvatar, but slightly different: this work tries to enhance the shoulder only while StyleAvatar's neural texture is for the whole image. It will be good if the authors can present very strong argument regarding this given my evaluation might be partially wrong.\n\nData:\nThe videos in the supplementary material do not present very large shoulder motions. I am not quite sure whether the model is robust in rendering the shoulder. However, I do see for slight shoulder motions, the model's performance is good.\n\nExperiment:\nI did not see the ablations for the main method part. The proposed methods include introducing the anchor gaussians for shoulder only, the 3d-2d correspondence, the neural texture compared with the baseline GS and PointAvatar. I will defer this part in the questions."

Can the authors provide the novel view synthesis for rendering the shoulder and also present the volumetric representation of the shoulder areas to let readers know how robust the model is for shoulder rendering?\n\n2. What exactly each module brings or benefits for the shoulder rendering? I think the following are possible ablations: \n(a) completely remove anchor gaussian and the 3D-2D correspondence, only relying on neural texture like in StyleAvatar\n(b) exclude Neural texture, use anchor gaussian only\n\n3. For the anchor gaussian, how the deformation achieved? If it is relying on LBS, due to that LBS is based on flame mesh that only contains the head and neck, there does not exist a real LBS for the shoulders. How should we understand the relationship between the deformation of shoulder gaussian point and neural texture? Is it a refinement of potential noisy deformed gaussian points?"
