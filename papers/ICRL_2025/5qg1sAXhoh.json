    "title": "Tree Search for Simultaneous Move Games via Equilibrium Approximation",
    "abstract": "Neural network supported tree-search has shown strong results in a variety of perfect information multi-agent tasks. However, the performance of these methods on partial information games has generally been below competing approaches. Here we study the class of simultaneous-move games, which are a subclass of partial information games which are most similar to perfect information games: both agents know the game state  with the exception of the opponent's move, which is revealed only after each agent makes its own move. Simultaneous move games  include popular benchmarks such as Google Research Football and Starcraft.\n\nIn this study we answer the question: can we take  tree search algorithms trained through self-play from perfect information settings and adapt them to  simultaneous move games without significant loss of performance? We answer this question by deriving a practical method that attempts to approximate a coarse correlated equilibrium as a subroutine within a tree search. Our algorithm works on cooperative, competitive, and mixed tasks. Our results are better than the current best MARL algorithms on a wide range of accepted baselines.",

However, the general strong performance over both competitive and cooperative tasks is impressive.\n- Overall I like the general simplicity of the approach in terms of the high-level methodology. Furthermore, I think the empirical results are strong on a fairly standard set of baselines."

                "value": "The paper has several weaknesses which prevent me from recommending it for acceptance.\n\nI think the actual description of the algorithm is unclear. At inference time, what is the tree-search algorithm? Appendix A.5 suggests that there will be a game tree and an MCTS-like algorithm (as does the title of the paper), but Section 4 suggests that the method is no-regret algorithms using 0-step lookahead (just q-values)?\n\nThe experiments performed also don't test the core hypothesis of the paper -- that the algorithm computes a CCE. The experimental results are also fishy, and hyperparameters are not given for the baselines. Perhaps my biggest issue with the paper is that in the experiments, CFR does not perform well on \"Goofspiel-6\", but one would expect CFR to be able to compute a close Nash equilibrium in the game. The experimental code for CFR does not seem to be in the code linked in the appendix.\n\nThe paper's driving motivation is convergence to CCE. However, the experiments measure head-to-head winrates. Head-to-head winrates already seem less preferable than head-to-head EV (since agent 1 may have +EV against agent 2 despite having a lower winrate). However, to measure convergence to CCE in small, 2P0S games, one could simply compute exploitability. \n\n--- \n\nThe paper should cite other methods that use neural nets and tree search to compute a CCE.\n- For example, ReBeL [0] and Deepstack/Student of Games [1] use CFR, where the players' marginal time-averaged strategies form a N.E. in 2P0S games, because their joint time-averaged strategy is a CCE [2].\n- Research in Diplomacy, a simultaneous-move multiplayer game, also uses neural nets, lookahead, and no-regret dynamics: [3], [4].\n- There is also a rich line of research into q-learning for equilibria in stochastic games. Although mostly in the 2-player setting, the approach is similar to this paper and should be cited. The research starts with Littman's seminal minimax q-learning, and the related works section of this paper ([5]) gives a good overview of modern developments.\n\nI believe this existing research contradicts the statement in the abstract: \"Neural network supported tree-search has shown strong results in a variety of perfect information multi-agent tasks. However, the performance of these methods on partial information games has generally been below competing approaches.\"\n\n---\n\n> This approach works well for zero-sum, perfect information games like chess or Go, but when we move into the realm of partial information games, the min-max paradigm becomes inappropriate.\n\nI would say the min-max paradigm is still valid in partial information games. The difference is between 2P0S and general-sum/multiplayer. Also, the paper should mention somewhere that the \"productized\" policies (each player playing their own marginal, time-averaged policies) of a CCE are Nash equilibria in the 2P0S setting.\n\n--- \n\n> The limitation for equilibrium approximation algorithms is that they are not easily applied to tasks with larger state and action spaces. The majority of testing regarding such algorithms have been on small tasks.\n\nI don't think this is true.\n\n--- \n\n> Using the regret bound provided by Neu (2015), it becomes clear that 800 time steps is insufficient for this method. At 800 time steps, the theoretically guarantees provided by EXP3-IX are very poor: we have not yet found the best action.\n\nWhy do we refer to a \"best action\"? Why do we expect that action probabilities stabilize? The guarantee is convergence to a CCE, not a \"best action\" (which isn't well-defined), no? A CCE is a *distribution* over *joint* actions.\n\n\n[0]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13544\n[1]: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3256\n[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11518\n[3]: Learning to Play No-Press Diplomacy with Best Response Policy Iteration\n[4]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05492\n[5]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05700"

The paper's writing and formatting are poor, with some images, tables, and equations arranged in a cluttered, two-column layout (e.g., Figures 1 and 4, Tables 1 and 2, and Equations 1-5), making the document look disorganized. Additionally, citation formatting is incorrect; in the ICLR template, \\citep should be used instead of \\citet when authors or publications are not part of the sentence.\n2. The paper lacks theoretical support. While it spends much space arguing that CCE is superior to min-max, it does not demonstrate that the combination of EXP3-IX and depth-limited d-MCTS can ultimately converge to CCE.\n3. The terminology is somewhat unprofessional. Typically, simultaneous-move games are not categorized as partially observable games, as standard Markov or stochastic game definitions allow for simultaneous moves. If the authors intend to contrast with traditional perfect information games, they should instead use \u201cimperfect information games\u201d.\n4. The paper makes several unsupported claims. For example, in line 35, the assertion that \"successes in partially observable settings have been more muted\" overlooks numerous well-known works in this setting (e.g., DeepStack, AlphaStar, OpenAI Five, DeepNash). Similarly, line 46 claims that \"playing according to a CCE gives you performance guarantees against any opponent in competitive tasks,\" which is inaccurate\u2014CCE does not ensure performance guarantees except in 2P0S games, where it aligns with Nash equilibrium."
