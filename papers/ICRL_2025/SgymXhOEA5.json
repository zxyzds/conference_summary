    "title": "Exploring the Camera bias of Person Re-identification",
    "abstract": "We empirically investigate the camera bias of person re-identification (ReID) models. Previously, camera-aware methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they are largely confined to training domains of the models. We measure the camera bias of ReID models on unseen domains and reveal that camera bias becomes more pronounced under data distribution shifts. As a debiasing method for unseen domain data, we revisit feature normalization on embedding vectors. While the normalization has been used as a straightforward solution, its underlying causes and broader applicability remain unexplored. We analyze why this simple method is effective at reducing bias and show that it can be applied to detailed bias factors such as low-level image properties and body angle. Furthermore, we validate its generalizability across various models and benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a simple yet effective test-time postprocessing method for ReID. In addition, we explore the inherent risk of camera bias in unsupervised learning of ReID models. The unsupervised models remain highly biased towards camera labels even for seen domain data, indicating substantial room for improvement. Based on observations of the negative impact of camera-biased pseudo labels on training, we suggest simple training strategies to mitigate the bias. By applying these strategies to existing unsupervised learning algorithms, we show that significant performance improvements can be achieved with minor modifications.",

This visualization could reveal feature distributions under camera bias conditions.\n2. The paper primarily addresses domain differences as camera biases. However, another type of camera bias, i.e., the number of samples varies between different cameras, and the identity labels may also be different, is not mentioned in the paper. The authors are welcome to discuss this bias.\n3. The description of the training strategy in 5.3 is too simple. Does discarding bias clustering drastically reduce the training samples? In addition, the parameter settings of the clustering algorithm can affect the clustering results, and whether there is a correlation between the settings of these parameters and the camera bias. This is not discussed by the authors"

They found that existing methods have camera bias, especially for self-supervised/unsupervised ones. The ones that have dedicated camera-aware design has less camera bias. I believe this observation is new. \n\n- The method is simple and effective. While this method has been used in test-time adaptation, authors use it to address a different problem in person re-id, which should be encouraged. \n\n- Rich insights are provided why camera bias arise. \n\n- I particularly like the fact that this method can be used to deal with human viewpoint bias (Sun and Zheng, 2019). Authors clearly have strong understanding of the field. \n\n- The paper is well written."
