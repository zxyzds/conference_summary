    "title": "Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance",
    "abstract": "Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.",

                "value": "1. While I believe this work has good practical values for the autonomous driving community, diffusion models have been explored in several works for motion prediction, closed-loop simulation, and motion planning in autonomous driving. The authors attempted to differentiate their work from existing works by emphasizing that the diffusion model does not drive performance improvements in these cases but relies on rule-based refinement or LLM, and they claimed that they are the first to fully harness the potential of diffusion models to enhance closed-loop planning performance in autonomous driving. However, this statement is quite vague, and it is unclear what novel technical contributions the authors have made in this work. My current impression is that the proposed model combines existing techniques investigated in the literature on diffusion models and learning-based motion planning for autonomous driving (e.g., transformer architecture, classifier guidance with manually designed cost functions, data augmentation, etc.). To help the audience better appreciate their novelty and contributions, the authors may list their novel contributions at the end of the Introduction. \n\n2. Related to the first point, the authors should provide a more extensive review of the related literature on diffusion models for autonomous driving. The authors currently give a concise discussion in Sec. 3.2. It should be moved to the related work section and extended to be more comprehensive. In particular, the current review misses an essential line of research on diffusion models for closed-loop simulation (e.g., [1], [2], [3]). Also, some works have developed diffusion-based motion planners for nuPlan (e.g., [4], [5], and [6]; the authors cited [4][5], but they are not included as baselines). If possible, they should be included as baselines for comparison. \n\n[1] Zhong, Ziyuan, et al. \"Guided conditional diffusion for controllable traffic simulation.\" ICRA 2023.\n[2] Zhong, Ziyuan, et al. \"Language-guided traffic simulation via scene-level diffusion.\" CoRL 2023. \n[3] Chang, Wei-Jer, et al. \"Safe-sim: Safety-critical closed-loop traffic simulation with diffusion-controllable adversaries.\" ECCV 2024.\n[4] Yang, Brian, et al. \"Diffusion-es: Gradient-free planning with diffusion for autonomous driving and zero-shot instruction following.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06559 (2024).\n[5] Hu, Yihan, et al. \"Solving motion planning tasks with a scalable generative model.\" ECCV 2024. \n[6] Sun, Qiao, et al. \"Large Trajectory Models are Scalable Motion Predictors and Planners.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.19620 (2023)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In Table 1, the authors only reported the proposed diffusion planner with collision guidance. How does the model perform with other types of guidance, especially when multiple guidance costs are used? \n\n2. When multiple guidance terms are used, the guidance cost becomes a weighted sum of several cost terms. I wonder if the authors have taken special care to ensure that the scales of different cost terms and their gradients are well balanced. It would be great if the authors could discuss if the guidance performance is sensitive to energy function design and cost weights."
