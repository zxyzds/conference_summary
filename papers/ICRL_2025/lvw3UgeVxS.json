    "title": "gRNAde: Geometric Deep Learning for 3D RNA inverse design",
    "abstract": "Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D geometry and conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state Graph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010), gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent ribozyme. Experimental wet lab validation on 10 different structured RNA backbones finds that gRNAde has an impressive success rate of 50%, a significant advance over 35% for Rosetta.

                "value": "The manuscript presents gRNAde, an approach for RNA inverse design conditioned on the 3D structure of RNA (conformational ensemble). The method uses geometric deep learning using a graph neural network which receives a set of backbone graphs derived from the 3D structure and predicts a set of RNA sequences (2D sequences of nucleotides (G,A,C,U).  \n\nThe approach is similar to ProteinMPNN (Daupara 2022) that solved a similar inverse problem for proteins. \n\nThe two key related works are Rosetta (Leman 2020) and RDesign (Tan et al. 2023), a comparison to the latter is presented in pages 16-17. In particular, RDesign is another deep learning based method for inverse RNA design. Among various issues that the authors highlight in the appendix, it appears that the proposed method is open source, outperforms this baseline, and can offer sampling, which is attractive for producing multiple solutions."

All recovery metric results reported in the RDesign paper are also incorrect due to this issue (at least based on how recovery is computed in protein design).\u201c (Page 16). There is no wet lab comparison to RDesign, and the authors should explain why this is not possible (e.g., using the re-engineered checkpoint that was used to compute some performance comparisons using recovery reported in Table 2 and Figure 2a)."

Do these properties affect performance results when the model is evaluated?\n\n- Are there any biases of the model, e.g., to certain pairs of nucleotides, e.g., CG pairs, see (Frnakenstein, Lyngsoe 2012)?"

Given that RNA 3D experimental data is much more limited and the structure of RNA being much more flexible than proteins, innovative approaches for this problem are desirable. The method although builds on existing architectures, employs sensible design suitable for RNA modeling (e.g.- using a three-bead (pseudotorsional) representation of the RNA backbone, minimizing the high-dimensional torsional space). \n2. gRNAde introduces an innovative multi-state GNN that models conformational ensembles\u2014distinct structural states of RNA\u2014by encoding them as a geometric multi-graph. The model's ability to simultaneously consider multiple conformations (or states) enhances its accuracy in predicting sequences that can adopt different functional forms.\n3. Benchmarking against Rosetta and other tools shows higher higher sequence recovery rate and speedup for gRNAde showcasing its usability for for high-throughput scenarios.\n4.

                "value": "Although the paper explores an interesting problem and presents a sensible approach, there are some aspects which can be improved.\n\n\n1. I did not find any discussion on if the model explicitly incorporates any biological nuances such as RNA modifications, cellular localization, or folding kinetics, which are essential for in vivo RNA functionality. Given that experimental training data is limited for RNA, such information may enhance performance especially that Physics based models often use such information as well. Some discussion around this can be helpful.\n\n2. The evaluation focuses primarily on sequence recovery and perplexity. However, there are other aspects such as structural stability, functional motifs, etc. that affect RNA design which if not accounted for may produce RNA designs that are theoretically correct but biologically unviable. Did the authors perform any analysis of these aspects in their designed RNAs?\n\n3. There are various ways to extract or represent the RNA backbone in molecular modeling and structural biology without clear consensus (see Richardson et al., 2008, RNA backbone: Consensus all-angle conformers and modular string nomenclature). Did the authors experiment with other backbone representations to see the impact of the particular choice of backbone representations?\n\n4. From evaluation perspective, I have several suggestions which may help understanding the performance of gRNAde:\n (a) I did not see any analysis on failure cases, thus limiting the understanding of scenarios where gRNAde may perform poorly, hindering its reliability and robustness.\n(b) Additionally, an evaluation of how varying RNA sequence lengths affect the performance may lead to better understanding of the pros and cons of gRNAde.\n(c) Finally, pseudoknots are important in RNA secondary structure, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate folding predictions, as pseudoknots play a critical role in the functional conformation of RNA molecules. The RNAInvBench paper (Cole et al., 2024) includes the pseudoknot-free and pseudoknot-inclusive benchmarks for RNA inverse design. It will be good to also compare against this benchmark."

Does the model incorporate RNA modifications, cellular localization, or folding kinetics? Can the authors add some discussion on how might this enhance performance given the limited experimental training data or if they can provide some analysis for the same, if possible? \n2. Apart from sequence recovery and perplexity, did the authors analyze structural stability and functional motifs that affect RNA viability?\n3. Did the authors experiment with different RNA backbone representations, and what impact did this choice have on the results?\n4. Can the authors analyze failure cases to improve understanding of gRNAde's limitations?\n5. Have the authors evaluated how varying RNA sequence lengths affect performance?\n6. Will the authors benchmark against the RNAInvBench paper (Cole et al., 2024) to assess the role of pseudoknots in their predictions as its importance has been highlighted as a crictical aspect to compare RNA inverse design models in RNAInvBench paper?"

In the first sentence of the abstract, the authors claim: \"Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure $\\textbf{without considering 3D geometry}$ and conformational diversity.\" I believe that the phrase \"without considering 3D geometry\" is factually incorrect. Because RDesign[1] performs inverse folding based on the 3D structure of RNA, it should take 3D geometry into account. The authors should provide a reasonable explanation or correct all descriptions in the paper that claim \"without considering 3D geometry.\"\n\n[1] RDESIGN: HIERARCHICAL DATA-EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR TERTIARY STRUCTURE-BASED RNA DESIGN. $\\textbf{ICLR 2024}$\n\n2. The experimental section lacks a comparison with RDESIGN, which is also deep-learning-based. Moreover, in the abstract, gRNAde should be compared with RDESIGN rather than Rosetta, which would be more reasonable. Figure 3(a) shows the performance of gRNAde under different numbers of conformations. This experiment also needs to be compared with RDESIGN. Although RDESIGN can only accept one conformation, the authors should use the result of RDESIGN with a single conformation as a baseline for comparison."
