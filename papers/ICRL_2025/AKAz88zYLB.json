    "title": "Conformal Prediction for Dose-Response Models with Continuous Treatments",
    "abstract": "Understanding the dose-response relation between a continuous treatment and the outcome for an individual can greatly drive decision-making, particularly in areas like personalized drug dosing and personalized healthcare interventions. Point estimates are often insufficient in these high-risk environments, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification to support informed decisions. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free and model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification, has seen limited application in continuous treatments or dose-response models. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology that frames the causal dose-response problem as a covariate shift, leveraging weighted conformal prediction. By incorporating propensity estimation, conformal predictive systems, and likelihood ratios, we present a practical solution for generating prediction intervals for dose-response models. Additionally, our method approximates local coverage for every treatment value by applying kernel functions as weights in weighted conformal prediction. Finally, we use a new synthetic benchmark dataset to demonstrate the significance of covariate shift assumptions in achieving robust prediction intervals for dose-response models.",

                "value": "The authors propose a conformal prediction-based method for estimating uncertainty in the dose-response function, which defines the effect of continuous treatment on a continuous outcome, in the presence of confounders. Their method uses weighted conformal prediction, with weights based on generalized propensity scores. The presentation is exemplary and instructive throughout, including the motivation for and description of the proposed method. Experiments cover two established simulation settings and one new simulation setting. Results show that the resulting prediction intervals tend to be conservative, in the sense that empirical coverage of the true dose-response function is higher than intended."
