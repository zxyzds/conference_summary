    "title": "GeneMamba: Early Parkinson\u2019s Detection via Wearable Device and Genetic Data",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, with its prevalence expected to rise as the global population ages. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and improved quality of life for patients. However, current accelerometer-based studies focus more on detecting the symptoms of PD, while less research has been conducted on early detection of PD. This study presents a novel multi-modal deep learning model named GeneMamba for early PD diagnosis, using state space modelling approaches to effectively analyze sequences and combining accelerometer data from wearable devices with genetic variants data. Our model predicts early PD occurrence up to 7 years before clinical onset, outperforming existing methods. Furthermore, through knowledge transfer, we enable accurate PD prediction using only wearable device data, enhancing our model's real-world applicability. Additionally, our interpretation methods uncover both established and previously unidentified genes associated with PD, advancing our understanding of the disease's genetic architecture and potentially highlighting new therapeutic targets. Our approach not only advances early PD diagnosis but also offers insights into the disease's etiology, paving the way for improved risk assessment and personalized interventions.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a model called GeneMamba that uses genetic data and accelerometer signals to do better performance in predictive tasks. What is novel about GeneMamba is the use of a state-space model that integrates cross-attention mechanisms to fuse together genetic and sensor-based information. The approach is introduced here as an alternative to traditional non-attention-based mechanisms. The authors present significant improvements both in terms of selectivity and generalizability with experimental evidence on a single dataset. However, their level in hyperparameters, layer configurations, and the data augmentation methods have not been wholly covered."

Such details would enhance reproducibility and be much useful to the research community in general.\n\nLimited Evaluation: Testing on only one dataset limits the paper's insights into the model's generalizability. Additional datasets, such as MODMA or MDS-UPDRS, could offer more robust evidence for GeneMamba's applicability across diverse data distributions.\n\nCross-Attention Mechanism: GeneMamba's description of their cross-attention mechanism is rather shallow. It is not clear at all how that implementation would compare to an attention model of normal types and how the selectivity mechanism of the model is impacted by that approach.\n\nLayer Freezing Experimentation: Freeze multiple layers without detailed study. Experiment different layer-freezing configurations such as freezing the last two or three layers to elucidate the stability-flexibility fine-tuning trade-offs."

Including details on layer sizes, configurations (e.g., ResMamba block), and data augmentation techniques would significantly enhance the work\u2019s reproducibility.\n\nHow does freezing multiple layers affect performance? Comparisons of freezing only the last layer versus additional layers would provide insights into balancing flexibility with stability.\n\nHave you considered evaluating the model on other datasets, such as MODMA or MDS-UPDRS, to assess its generalizability? This would help address any dataset-specific biases."

How do the authors ensure that the selected architecture is the best for each new block and not overly optimized for Mamba. For example, when using the Transformer blocks, the authors could decrease the number of layers to prevent overfitting on the small dataset?\n2) Lack of comparison with current works and multimodal baselines. I do not agree with the author's claims that \"little literature has tried deep learning models for early PD prediction using accelerometer data\". Please see [1, 2, 3] for some references. In addition, there are early, late, and joint fusion approaches which are well-understood and common baselines for dealing with multimodal healthcare data [4].\n3) The discussion on the novel genes discovered is unsubstantiated. Although the model selects some unidentified genes, there is no guarantee that it is relevant to PD pathology. \n4) Lack of implementation details in terms of model architecture (e.g., number of layers, hidden layer size etc) and loss function. There are some descriptions in the main text, but uses vague language (e.g., We gradually increase the size of the feature embeddings from 64 to 512). The loss function has two separate loss components and an \u03b1 term is used in equation 3 to weigh the losses. However, the authors do not provide the \u03b1 value that is used.\n\n[1] Prince, J., Andreotti, F., & De Vos, M. (2018).
