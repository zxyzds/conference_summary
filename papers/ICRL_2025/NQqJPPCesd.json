    "title": "Towards Marginal Fairness Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter",
    "abstract": "The Sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) is a widely acknowledged method for efficiently generalizing the averaging operation within probability measure spaces. However, achieving marginal fairness SWB, ensuring approximately equal distances from the barycenter to marginals, remains unexplored. The uniform weighted SWB is not necessarily the optimal choice to obtain the desired marginal fairness barycenter due to the heterogeneous structure of marginals and the non-optimality of the optimization. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we define the marginal fairness sliced Wasserstein barycenter (MFSWB) as a constrained SWB problem. Due to the computational disadvantages of the formal definition, we propose two hyperparameter-free and computationally tractable surrogate MFSWB problems that implicitly minimize the distances to marginals and encourage marginal fairness at the same time. To further improve the efficiency, we perform slicing distribution selection and obtain the third surrogate definition by introducing a new slicing distribution that focuses more on marginally unfair projecting directions. We discuss the relationship of the three proposed problems and their relationship to sliced multi-marginal Wasserstein distance. Finally, we conduct experiments on finding 3D point-clouds averaging, color harmonization, and training of sliced Wasserstein autoencoder with class-fairness representation to show the favorable performance of the proposed surrogate MFSWB problems.",

                "value": "The traditional Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter (SWB) employs uniform weights between the barycenter and its marginals, leading to imbalances in the distances between them. This paper introduces the Marginal Fairness Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter (MFSWB), which aims to equalize these distances, ensuring a fairer representation. The authors propose three algorithms to address the MFSWB formulation and conduct experiments on synthetic Gaussian distributions, 3D point clouds, color harmonization, and generative models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, validating the authors' claims."

                "value": "This paper addresses an important problem that has been overlooked. In traditional SWB, the weights between barycenter and marginals are uniform. However, this uniform weights actually leads to non-uniform distances between the barycenter and the marginals. The authors have a simple experiment demonstrating that in the paper. To ensure equal distances, they propose the MFSWB to address this problem. They define MFSWB such that the average distance to be within an $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe proposed MFSWB is hard to solve. The authors proposed three surrogate definitions for MFSWB. The first one, called s-MFSWB, aims to minimize the maximal distance from the barycenter to the marginals. Yet, the s-MFSWB is biased. To rectify this, they proposed the second unbiased surrogate, us-MFSWB. They show that us-MFSWB's objective is an upper bound of s-MFSWB, meaning that minimizing us-MFSWB implicitly minimizes s-MFSWB. Furthermore, They also show that the approximation error of the gradient estimator of us-MFSWB reduces at the order of $\\mathcal{O}(L^{\u22121/2})$. Since s-MFSWB and us-MFSWB both use the uniform distribution as the slicing distribution, which can empirically result in non-optimal in statistical estimation, the authors proposed the energy-based surrogate MFSWB (es-MFSWB) which considers the importance of the sampling directions. \n\nThe authors conducted extensive experiments evaluating the proposed methods and comparing the methods against the conventional SWB. The results are convincing. Using the synthetic Gaussian data, they showed that SWB produced the barycenter with non-uniform distances from the marginals, whereas the proposed methods yielded barycenters with approximately equal distances from the marginals. The authors also performed experiments on the 3D points clouds, Color Harmonization, and generative models with both quantitative results and qualitative results showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed es-MFSWB appears to be the best among all three proposed methods. \n\nThe authors shows the potential of using the proposed method in learning conditional generative models as an inverse barycenter problem."
