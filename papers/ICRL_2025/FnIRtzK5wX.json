    "title": "Disentangling the QiGan Encoded by a DNN towards the Go Game",
    "abstract": "Given a deep neural network (DNN) that has surpassed human beings in a task, disentangling the explicit knowledge encoded by the DNN to obtain some new insights into the task is a new promising-yet-challenging regime in explainable AI. In this paper, we aim to disentangle the ''QiGan'' encoded by the AI model for the Go game, which has beat top human players. Specifically, we disentangle primitive shape patterns of stones memorized by the value network, and these shape patterns represent the ''QiGan'' used to conduct a fast situation assessment of the current board state. The universal-matching property of interactions ensure that human players can learn accurate and verifiable shape patterns, rather than specious intuitive analysis. In experiments, our method explains lots of novel shape patterns beyond traditional shape patterns in human knowledge.",

                "value": "1) This paper presents a novel method to extract the knowledge learned by a DNN value network for the game of Go. The proposed method can extract learned shape patterns in KataGo an OSS model trained to play Go. The extracted shape patterns align with the intuition of human players in most cases but also lead to new intuitions. \n\n2) The authors make several key contributions to ensure the extracted shape patterns are not spurious. \n a) Previously it was shown that Go board state value predictions can be formulated using AND interactions between the stones but it is not sufficient so the authors introduce OR interactions.  \n b) They make sure the universal matching property is satisfied i.e no matter how you mask the board state an accurate value prediction can be made using the discovered shape patterns. \nc) Authors made sure the extracted interactions are higher order such that they are transferrable between board states."

Indeed, the authors mention that they generalize their method to Gobang, which is a different game played on the same board as Go.

                "value": "I found this paper to be inscrutable. The goal is commendable, but a paper about interpretability should not be so challenging to understand. I would recommend moving most of the theorems to the SI. Simplify your explanation of the method into an intuition, which you back up with references to specific theorems and proofs. Top-line the human/model study instead of the method that you used to derive those insights. Use the figures to highlight strategies taken from the model. In other words, follow the template of \"Acquisition of Chess Knowledge in AlphaZero.\" I honestly don't know how to read this paper because it is so dense and so challenging to parse in its current form. \n\nRelatedly, the writing needs a lot of work. Beyond just the organization of the paper, and top-lining the main points, lots of the language is challenging to parse. For example, the italicized sentence in the intro is very challenging to parse. This should be written as simply as possible to make the paper more impactful. \n\nThis is a purely qualitative paper, which adds to the challenge of interpreting it. There needs to be some hypothesis testing in order to show that the methods and insights are indeed significant."

The reviewer suggests that this section be included in the main paper.\n\n- Section 2.5 is missing a quantitative analysis. The authors offer a few examples to demonstrate whether their approach can detect meaningful Go states. However, the reviewer believes that this analysis should be enhanced by including an evaluation protocol. For instance, how many Go players are assessing these states? What qualifications do the players need to be considered professionals? A substantial number of examples should be extracted from actual Go games. Additionally, it is crucial to clarify what information is provided to the human players: are they given only the Go state or both the Go state and the v(x) values? This clarity is vital for enhancing the scientific quality and reproducibility of the work.\n\n- Figure 2 could be improved. The reviewer recommends combining the two sub-figures into one to clearly illustrate the increase in the sparsity of interactions when both AND and OR interactions are considered."
