    "title": "Deep Learning for Micro-Scale Crack Detection on Imbalanced Datasets Using Key Point Localization",
    "abstract": "Internal crack detection has been a subject of focus in structural health monitoring. By focusing on crack detection in structural datasets, it is demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively analyse seismic wave fields interacting with micro-scale cracks, which are beyond the resolution of conventional visual inspection.\n\nThis work explores a novel application of DL based key point detection technique, where cracks are localized by predicting the coordinates of four key points that define a bounding region of the crack.\nThe study not only opens new research directions for non-visual applications but also effectively mitigates the impact of imbalanced data which poses a challenge for previous DL models, as it can be biased toward predicting the majority class (non-crack regions). Popular DL techniques, such as the Inception blocks are used and investigated. \nThe model shows an overall reduction in loss when applied to micro-scale crack detection and is reflected in the lower average deviation between the location of actual and predicted cracks, with an average IOU being 0.511 for all micro cracks (> 0.00 \u00b5m) and 0.631 for larger micro cracks (> 4 \u00b5m).",

                "value": "The proposed method reduces computational complexity enhancing the efficiency of the crack detection by focusing on predicting four key points rather than analysing every pixel by making use of the seismic waves rather than visual cues to detect cracks.\n\nThe proposed model has fewer layers, parameters, and shorter training times for detecting single, rectangular cracks.\n\nThe model\u2019s architecture and training process are suitable for detecting single, rectangular cracks, providing targeted performance improvements for this particular crack type."

This could be particularly problematic for smaller cracks, where minor deviations in key-point placement could significantly impact the model's accuracy.\n\nEven though the paper addresses data imbalance by using key-point detection, significant risk of bias remains. As an example, in real-world scenarios, where crack samples are often sparse and data distributions differ from simulated conditions, the model\u2019s reliance on simulated data may cause it to disproportionately predict non-crack regions.\n\nThe model\u2019s current design only allows for the detection of a single, rectangular crack per sample, which may limit its practical applicability. However, many real-world scenarios often involve multiple or irregularly shaped cracks."

All the components presented in this paper are directly derived from prior works; Inception modules [Szegedy+14] are used to construct the network which is trained based on a standard loss functions such as MSE, MAE and Huber losses, and then it is tested on the dataset synthesized by [Moreh+24].\n\n- This paper lacks clear advantage to formulate the crack detection as bounding-box regression over a standard semantic segmentation approach [Moreh+24]. Generally speaking, bounding boxes would miss capturing detailed structure/shape of cracks; for example, length, width and (dis-)connectivity of cracks are important for structural health monitoring, which bounding boxes are unaware of. As to performance, the experimental results do not clearly show superiority of the bounding box approach.\n\n- In this community, *width* of networks is usually indicated by the number of filters [Zagoruyko+17]. Although the authors claim to propose  *wide* network, it is just composed of inception modules without paying much attention to the number of filters. Thus, the authors' claim is misleading.\n\n- Statements in Sec.1 are rather exaggerated. The crack-detection task that this paper tackles stems from [Moreh+24].\n\n- This paper is poorly presented. \n  - The structure, e.g., dimensions, of input signals is unclear in Secs.1~3. Thus, it is less understandable why 2-D CNN is applied to this task. Fig.1 that shows an input as 1-D signal is quite misleading since the input is actually shaped as 3-D tensor of H x W x Time. \n\n  - There are some redundant descriptions; Sec.3.3 is heavily overlapped with Sec.3.1, and it does not mention the training procedure. Sec.3.4 (*Datasets*) is also described in a redundant manner.\n\n### Minor comments\n- Section numbers in Sec.*Evaluation* are wrong."

As we know, the tiny cracks captured by high-resolution cameras will also show large width. The problem of detecting tiny crack will generate into that of detecting common cracks. What's the problem of detecting cracks in the visual perception perspective?\n- The authors employ Inception-like wide convolutions, but the only model compared is a segmentation method based on DenseNet. Recent advancements in fields such as crack detection and edge detection, including methods like EfficientCrackNet and SegFormer, are notably absent from the comparisons. Including these would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model's performance against current state-of-the-art techniques.\n- The discussion around the model's performance in cases of closely spaced or overlapping cracks is insufficient. More examples and analyses in this area would help clarify the model's limitations.\n- While the comparative analysis highlights improvements in training efficiency, it lacks a discussion on the trade-offs involved in model complexity and performance. An exploration of how reduced layers and parameters might impact detection accuracy would be valuable.\n- Figures 3-6 depicting results could be made more informative. While they present predicted versus ground truth, additional context or examples of challenging cases would provide a more comprehensive view of model performance.\n- The manuscript would benefit from a more polished writing style, as some sections are verbose and could be more concise. Specifically, in Section 3.0.1, the description of wide convolutional networks should be simplified to focus on the core benefits without repetitive elaboration. Additionally, in Section 3.2, the authors only introduce three different loss functions without clearly specifying which one is utilized for model optimization during training.
