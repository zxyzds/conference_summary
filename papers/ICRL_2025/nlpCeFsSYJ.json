    "title": "DOME: Taming Diffusion Model into High-Fidelity Controllable Occupancy World Model",
    "abstract": "We propose DOME, a diffusion-based world model that predicts future occupancy frames based on past occupancy observations. The ability of this world model to capture the evolution of the environment is crucial for planning in autonomous driving. Compared to 2D video-based world models, the occupancy world model utilizes a native 3D representation, which features easily obtainable annotations and is modality-agnostic. This flexibility has the potential to facilitate the development of more advanced world models. Existing occupancy world models either suffer from detail loss due to discrete tokenization or rely on simplistic diffusion architectures, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in predicting future occupancy with controllability. Our DOME exhibits two key features: (1) High-Fidelity and Long-Duration Generation. We adopt a spatial-temporal diffusion transformer to predict future occupancy frames based on historical context. This architecture efficiently captures spatial-temporal information, enabling high-fidelity details and the ability to generate predictions over long durations. (2)Fine-grained Controllability. We address the challenge of controllability in predictions by introducing a trajectory resampling method, which significantly enhances the model\u2019s ability to generate controlled predictions. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes. Specifically, our approach surpasses the baseline by 10.5% in mIoU and 21.2% in IoU for occupancy reconstruction, and by 36.0% in mIoU and 24.6% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting.",

                "value": "1. The authors mentioned around line 123 in the related work section that \"BEV methods struggle to convey detailed 3D information due to their top-down projection.\" However, the authors' approach is still operating in \"transform[ed] ... Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) style tensor\" (line 199). How would the BEV style feature be better than other approaches in maintaining \"detailed 3D information\" during VAE latent space compression?\n2. Section 3.1 mentions the \"class embedding\" that needs to be learned for OCC-VAE, without much detailed discussion on its purpose and downstream impacts. Would this be, for example, a potential bottolneck for making the model more generalizable?\n3. It seems like that, in Tab. 3, the trajectory resampling technique allows for a rather reasonable improvement on the mIoU and IoU metric. Do the authors think of the technique as the central piece of this paper's novelty that allows for SOTA performance? If similar data augmentation is applied to OccWorld or OccLLaMA, would they also perform on par with DOME? (sorry I may not be super familiar with this specific line of work, and I am willing to improve my rating as needed)\n4. Missing spaces in line 467 \"further demonstrating that DOMEhas strong generalizability\" and line 494 \": 4D occupancy forecasting performance.Avg. denotes...\" I would suggest further proof reading.\n5. Tab. 4 suggests that DOME allows for 32s rollout for long duration generation without explicitly discussing the potential accumulated error. What's preventing the model from generating a even longer rollout if error range is not considered (particularly given the autoregressive approach)?"

The dataset used is an autonomous driving dataset with ego-vehicle movement, not a static city-scale occupancy dataset, which limits the effectiveness of trajectory resampling in addressing these issues.\n3. The experiments for occupancy reconstruction and 4D occupancy prediction lack fairness in comparison. The reconstruction phase includes multi-frame inputs and spatio-temporal interaction, and the 4D occupancy prediction also leverages training parameters from the reconstruction stage. The authors should provide a fair comparison with other multi-frame input methods in the experimental section."

The authors claim to achieve occupancy predictions under different trajectory controls;   however, the visualized results appear somewhat limited, as the vehicle's movement along the trajectory is mini  Could the authors present a 32-second controlled trajectory prediction and provide a clearer visualization of the relationship between trajectory control and the scene?\n\n3. How does the author solve the problem of dynamic objects in the reconstruction of possible scenes by using BEV map in trajectory resamping? The nuScenes data set will move with the self-driving car, and the surrounding vehicles will also move. It seems difficult to make a reasonable dynamic scene by changing the track of a self-driving vehicle (i.e. maintaining consistency between multiple different vehicle resampling tracks and their respective Occupancy dynamic scenes).\n\n[1] Wei, Julong, et al. \"OccLLaMA: An Occupancy-Language-Action Generative World Model for Autonomous Driving.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.03272 (2024)."

The control of directions is still not accurate. From the visualizations, the ego car just slightly turns left or right, given the high-level command. Also, the generated scenes (e.g., the buildings and trees) are different for the same input scene with different trajectory conditions. I think a good world model should be able to generate consistent results for different trajectory conditions. \n3. The authors do not compare their methods with OccSora (visualizations), which can also achieve long-term and trajectory-conditioned generation.\n4.
