    "title": "Efficient Newton-type Federated Learning with Non-IID Data",
    "abstract": "The mainstream federated learning algorithms only communicate the first-order information across the local devices, i.e., FedAvg and FedProx. However, only using first-order information, these methods are often inefficient and the impact of heterogeneous data is yet not precisely understood. This paper proposes an efficient federated Newton method (FedNewton), by sharing both first-order and second-order knowledge over heterogeneous data. In general kernel ridge regression setting, we derive the generalization bounds for FedNewton and obtain the minimax-optimal learning rates. For the first time, our results analytically quantify the impact of the number of local examples, the data heterogeneity and the model heterogeneity. Moreover, as long as the local sample size is not too small and data heterogeneity is moderate, the federated error in FedNewton decreases exponentially in terms of iterations. Extensive experimental results further validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the advantages of FedNewton over the first-order methods.",

Lack of Comprehensive Baselines: The comparison is limited to traditional methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, and FeDKRR, which restricts the ability to verify the novelty and superiority of the proposed method. The authors should compare their work with established Newton-type Federated Learning methods in experiments,  e.g., [1], [2], [3].\n\n2. Limited Applicability: The proposed method appears to be applicable only to very simple machine learning models like KRR. The algorithm and analysis are rooted in this model, which may not generalize to more complex tasks. Moreover, the practical implementation of Newton-type methods in deep learning models is challenging due to the high computational cost of Hessian calculations. The authors emphasize their contribution by comparing their method with traditional KRR methods and older first-order FL methods (e.g., FedAvg and FedProx), which may not adequately showcase the advantages of their approach. \n\n3. Marginal Performance Improvement: The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers only a slight performance enhancement. Could you please provide additional analysis or ablation studies to demonstrate that the performance improvements are due to their methodological contribution rather than hyperparameter tuning.\n\nRef:\n\n[1] Elgabli A, Issaid C B, Bedi A S, et al.

In typical federated learning methods like FedAvg and FedProx, only first-order gradient information is used, which often fails to perform well when data distributions differ significantly among clients. FedNewton, on the other hand, leverages second-order information by approximating Hessians, allowing it to handle these data heterogeneity better. The paper includes strong theoretical guarantees on generalization and convergence rates, and it breaks down the federated error into components that account for covariate shift and concept shift\u2014where differences in data distributions and target relationships across clients make global model training challenging. With the help of second-order updates, FedNewton improves communication efficiency while achieving better accuracy, given in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets."
