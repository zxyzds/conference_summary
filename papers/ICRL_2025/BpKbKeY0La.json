    "title": "AddSR: Accelerating Diffusion-based Blind Super-Resolution with Adversarial Diffusion Distillation",
    "abstract": "Blind super-resolution methods based on Stable Diffusion (SD) demonstrate impressive generative capabilities in reconstructing clear, high-resolution (HR) images with intricate details from low-resolution (LR) inputs. However, their practical applicability is often limited by poor efficiency, as they require hundreds to thousands of sampling steps.\nInspired by Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), we incorporate this approach to design a highly effective and efficient blind super-resolution method. Nonetheless, two challenges arise: First, the original ADD significantly reduces result fidelity, leading to a perception-distortion imbalance. Second, SD-based methods are sensitive to the quality of the conditioning input, while LR images often have complex degradation, which further hinders effectiveness.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a Timestep-Adaptive ADD (TA-ADD) to mitigate the perception-distortion imbalance caused by the original ADD. Furthermore, we propose a prediction-based self-refinement strategy to estimate HR, which allows for the provision of more high-frequency information without the need for additional modules.\nExtensive experiments show that our method,~\\name, generates superior restoration results while being significantly faster than previous SD-based state-of-the-art models (e.g., $7\\times$ faster than SeeSR).",

The main focus of this work is to emphasize acceleration through ADD, but most of the discussions revolve around addressing the limitations of ADD, then introducing certain tricks (i.e., loss function, improving image condition) to tackle the problems, without demonstrating noticeable effects in improving efficiency.\n\n2. Another focus of this paper is to resolve the perception-distortion trade-off using the proposed TA-ADD loss. However, from Tables 1 and 3, it is evident that this framework fails to push the boundary of this trade-off. Instead, this framework achieves improved perceptual quality by heavily sacrificing fidelity, as indicated by low PSNR/SSIM scores.\n\n3. The lack of comparison with other efficient SD-based methods (e.g., OSEDiff) makes it difficult to verify whether the effectiveness of this framework under similar efficiency.\n\n4. On main focus of this work is to address perception-fidelity imbalance. In practice, SD-based SR methods can trade off between fidelity perceptual quality by employing inference tricks (e.g., manually added text prompts). However, this paper does not specify the inference setup of each baseline, nor does it achieve promising results with an acceptable level of fidelity drop.\n\n5. In Table 1, the performance of this framework is not comparable with existing SD-based methods in several metrics. Specifically, while the proposed method shows better visual quality, it significantly underperforms in fidelity-oriented metrics such as PSNR and SSIM.\n\n6. In Table 2, this framework doesn't deliver similar perceptual quality scores as SUPIR, such that comparing other settings at this point does not adequately demonstrate the advantages of this approach.\n\n7. Confusing terminology. For example, in the caption of Figure 3, the term \"predicted HR\" image is used. Typically, \"HR image\" refers to ground truth. Since your method also uses the ground truth HR image as a condition for the teacher model, mixing the use of the term \"HR\" might lead to misunderstanding."

                "value": "1. This paper emphasizes that the proposed PSR can utilize the HR output to \"control\" the final output, but the experiment about how to control the intermediate results and influence the final output is missing.\n\n2. PSR leverages the intermediate SR result as the condition for the next iteration. However, as shown in Figure 5(b), SD-based SR methods often have hallucination issues. Did you consider error accumulation in this scenario? Did you apply any additional processing to the intermediate output (e.g., blurring) to prevent error accumulation?\n\n3. Line 230: \"The $\\hat{x_0}$ in each step has more high-frequency information to better control the model output.\" However, in Figure 5(b), the hallucinated animal head also contains high-frequency components. How do you prove that high-frequency components necessarily provide better guidance?\n\n4. This work adopts SeeSR as the backbone and teacher model. Did you use manually added prompts when generating images, such as \"clean,\" \"high-resolution,\" or \"8k\" as used in SeeSR? Since these prompts greatly influence the perception-fidelity trade-off in SR output, their use may also affect your model's performance when intermediate results are regarded as crucial conditions. Could you compare the impact on performance with and without these prompts? \n\n5. Why does your method, which uses the same framework as SeeSR and reduces the number of steps from 50 to 4, only achieve a 7$\\times$ speedup (which ideally should be 12.5$\\times$)?\n\n6. The entire training scheme appears to be overfitting to the 4-step setting, however, the ablation about the choice of this hyperparameter is missing. What will happen if you use the trained student model for 5 or more steps during inference?\n\n7. In the design of the $L_{ta-dis}$ loss, why do you use the output of the student model as the input of the teacher model, then enforcing similarity between the teacher output and student output? This implies that the purpose of the $L_{ta-dis}$ is for the teacher to learn identity rather than to improve the student. However, since the teacher does not have any learnable layers, this design cannot derive such effect."

Given that PSR can be applied to previous stable diffusion-based SR models without the need for retraining, could the authors present both quantitative and qualitative results showing the performance of PSR on other models?\n\n3. Instead of using enhanced conditions in PSR, would it be possible to substitute all LR images with predicted SR images from simpler SR methods like RealESRGAN? If the richer conditional information from PSR is a crucial factor, then using a naively super-resolved image could be more beneficial during the initial timesteps. Here, instead of retraining the model with SR image conditions, it might suffice to replace the \\hat{x}^{0}\u200b condition with outputs from RealESRGAN on a pretrained AddSR model."
