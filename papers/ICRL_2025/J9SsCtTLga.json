    "abstract": "In the present paper, we propose a new approach and a dataset for generating NeRF-like noise on the mesh surface.  Our approach is based on GAN and was trained on a dataset we collected using real NeRF noise. The core idea of our method lies in the use of graph convolutions in the generator.Our model demonstrates generated NeRF-like noise more accurate than other methods by mesh denoising benchmarking. We also present a new NeRF noise analysis approach HTPH based on a conditional probability model to measure the similarity of mesh noise.",

                "value": "This paper presents an intriguing approach to generating NeRF-like noise on mesh surfaces, along with a dataset tailored for this purpose. The authors construct a dataset and train a GAN for NeRF-based mesh denoising. I appreciate the innovative Mesh Transition Probability Heatmap (MTPH) concept, which accounts for the influence of a vertex\u2019s neighborhood rather than focusing on individual vertices alone. This neighborhood-aware approach leads to a more accurate analysis of noise distribution.\n\nHowever, I believe the authors could improve the clarity of their presentation. For example, Figure 1 effectively contrasts random noise with NeRF noise, and I can clearly observe the structured pattern characteristic of NeRF noise. However, the figure lacks crucial contextual details\u2014such as the structure of the mesh and the meaning of the axes\u2014that would aid in interpreting the depicted patterns. This missing information makes Figure 1 somewhat confusing.\n\nAdditionally, while the authors report quantitative metrics to evaluate their results, I would like to see more visual comparisons, such as rendered images, that illustrate the proposed denoising approach\u2019s effectiveness. Unfortunately, such visual comparisons are absent, which could have provided valuable insight into the visual improvements achieved by the method."

Additionally, it proposes a novel approach\u2014Mesh Transition Probability Heatmap (MTPH)\u2014to measure noise by considering both vertex offsets and their neighboring relationships. The authors effectively demonstrate the strength of this method through superior performance results.

                "value": "I appreciate the thorough evaluation conducted by the authors, but I believe it is essential to include denoised renderings to visually highlight the differences between their approach and others. Additionally, using the DPSR + MC method for dataset preparation may impose constraints, particularly for meshes with complex topologies, and this limitation should be discussed in the paper. The only visual example provided is of a bird model, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the approach\u2019s advantages comprehensively. I strongly recommend including more visual examples to enhance the clarity of the results.\n\nMoreover, while the dataset and model show promising results within a controlled setting, further validation on a broader range of real-world meshes would strengthen claims about the approach\u2019s practical applicability."

Have the authors tested their model with the same object but with different mesh connectivities? If so, what were the findings?"

For example, add more applications and comparisons of mesh denoising or even point cloud denoising.\n\nThere seems to be something wrong with the reference on line 299. Should the reference format start from bpy instead of the community?\n\nThe two noise distributions shown in Figure 1 are interesting, but the mesh denoising process doesn't only consider random noise? There are also many types of noise such as white noise, blue noise, simulated scanning noise, etc. I think comparing more noise types can better highlight the special features of Nerf."
