    "title": "A Hypothesis on Black Swan in Unchanging Environments",
    "abstract": "Black swan events are statistically rare occurrences that carry extremely high risks. A typical view of defining black swan events is heavily assumed to originate from an unpredictable time-varying environments; however, the community lacks a comprehensive definition of black swan events. To this end, this paper challenges that the standard view is incomplete and claims that high-risk, statistically rare events can also occur in unchanging environments due to human misperception of their value and likelihood, which we call as spatial black swan event. We first carefully categorize black swan events, focusing on spatial black swan events, and mathematically formalize the definition of black swan events. We hope these definitions can pave the way for the development of algorithms to prevent such events by rationally correcting human perception.",

                "value": "This paper challenges the conventional understanding of black swan events, which are typically seen as arising from unpredictable and dynamic environments. The authors propose that such high-risk, statistically rare events can also occur in static environments due to human misperception of events\u2019 values and likelihoods, introducing the concept of S-BLACK SWAN. The paper categorizes black swan events, formalizes their definitions mathematically, and provides a framework for understanding and preventing these events through improved perception."

This new perspective could open up fresh avenues for research in risk management and machine learning.\n- The theoretical framework is well-developed, with rigorous mathematical formalizations and proofs. The use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to model human perception and misperception is particularly robust.\n- The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions and logical progression of ideas.\n- By redefining the origins of black swan events, the paper has the potential to significantly impact the fields of machine learning, risk management, and decision theory. It provides a foundation for developing algorithms that can better handle rare, high-risk events."

It gives a good framework for future researchers to build upon while trying to model such s-Black Swan events.

The reader gets to the end of the section and is then told that this literature does not cover black swan events, but this statement lacks enough motivation.\n\t* The contribution of the paper is highlighted as defining an S-Black Swan event, but this contribution does not appear to be motivated by issues the current RL algorithms struggle within the literature. Every so often the paper includes comments like \u201caimed at guiding the design of safer ML algorithms in the future\u201d; \u201claying the groundwork for future algorithmic design\u201d; and \u201ctraditional risk criteria in RL are insufficient for managing the unique risks associated with black swan events\u201d. While these comments might be the motivation of the paper, a more concrete motivation could be showing (or referencing) a specific RL (or ML) scenario which could benefit from this new definition and formalization of a S-Black-Swan event. This update seems like it would be important for an ICLR conference venue.\n\nTypos:\n* Line 108 $\\mathbf{p}_c = \u2026$ should be 3 prob choices.\n\nComment:\n* Figures 1c and 1d could benefit from being moved further down in the paper."

The probability distortion function seems like it would be an easier function to measure in practice compared to the value distortion function. Each individual might legitimately have different reasons to value outcomes differently. Going with Example 1, a loss of -1000 might be significantly worse for a poorer person than a richer person. It looks like the theory still holds when $\\epsilon_r = 0$, but $\\epsilon_d > 0$, but could the authors comment on that?\n3. If possible, could the authors provide additional context to the novelty of the work and how previous works have not considered an S-Black-Swan event, and attributed rare events to changing environments."

                "value": "In my opinion, the most important weakness of the paper is that apart from the main claim (black swans in unchanging environments), it is not clear to me what the main takeaways of the paper are. The authors wrote in the abstract \"We hope these definitions can pave the way for the development of algorithms to prevent such events by rationally correcting limitations in perception\", but it is not clear to me how the definitions and theoretical results presented in the paper can really benefit this: under the formalization of the paper, black swans in stationary environments essentially stem from the distorted transition and reward functions, which naturally create a gap between the ground truth MDP and the human MDP. The main theoretical result of the paper (Theorem 4) focuses on proving this gap in the context of value function estimation, yet such a result is quite straightforward and the techniques used in proving it (bounding the gap in value estimation given the gap in transition and reward functions) is also somewhat common in the RL literature. Perhaps more importantly, I feel that such a result (and also the result in Theorem 5) is not really useful to inspire algorithm design since it does not tell us _how_ to correct the misperceptions in the human MDP. Other results in the paper are also quite natural to me and seem not really tied to the specific black swan problem considered by the paper (see Questions for details). While the authors have extensively discussed in the appendix that existing solutions in safe RL may also fall short, only _defining_ such a problem is not enough to me for acceptance.\n\nI also have some concerns about the overall presentation of the paper. For example, the formal definition of s-black swan is deferred to Section 6 but heavily referred to in earlier sections, and I think it may be better to move this definition to earlier sections in the paper. I also do not understand the role of Section 3 beyond it re-emphasizes the main claim of the paper in Remark 1."

The lemma in the main text is stated for visitation probabilities, while the proof in the appendix seems to only deal with rewards. The authors could clarify if there is a connection between the reward-based proof and the visitation probability statement that is not immediately apparent.\n\n- Theorem 3 seems a quite general (and somewhat trivial) result to me: of course if we consider a sufficiently general case, the difference in MDP transition probabilities would result in different optimal policies. What is the concrete relation between this result and the s-black swan defined by the paper?\n\n- What is the role of Proposition 1\uff1fAnd isn't it contradictory to Algorithm 1 (Algorithm 1 defines an s-black swan for arbitrary $t$, while Proposition 1 considers $t$ in specific time intervals)?\n\n- How the definitions and theoretical results in the paper may be used to aid algorithm design?\n\n- Could the hitting time analysis in Theorem 5 be used to inform when to trigger perception updates?"
