    "title": "Learning to Imitate with Less: Efficient Individual Behavior Modeling in Chess",
    "abstract": "As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand artificial intelligence systems, developing AI agents that can accurately emulate individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, with its long-standing role as a benchmark for AI research and its precise measurement of skill through chess ratings, provides an ideal environment for studying human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human behavior require large amounts of data from each individual, making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we introduce Maia4All, a model designed to learn and adapt to individual decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves this by leveraging a two-stage fine-tuning method to bridge population and individual-level models and uses a meta-network to initialize and refine these embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess. Our work provides an example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users using a prototype model as a bridge, which could lead to better and more accessible human-AI collaboration in other fields like education, healthcare, and strategic decision-making.",

                "value": "This paper is about improving the ability of a pre-trained chess neural network (Maia-2) to match individual behavior in chess with little data (20 games). The overall approach involves first fine-tuning the base model on a set of \"prototype\" players balanced across strength levels, and the fine-tuning embeddings initialized from the most similar prototype players. The results show marginal improvements in matching individual chess behavior with few games (~51% -> ~53%)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The paper is not sufficiently well-written. There are many things unclear to me as a reader. For example:\n    - How does the model use the population/individual embeddings?\n    - Since you want to predict next moves, why do you need a value head and auxiliary losses?\n    - It is difficult for me to understand what\u2019s going on in Figure 1.\n- A more fundamental issue with the work is its generality. This paper proposes an initialization technique to solve a problem that is very specific (low-resource individual behavior modeling in chess). It is unclear to me if such techniques could be useful for other more practical tasks (e.g., learning the writing style of a person with 20 documents).\n- The proposed method, given its complexity, provides marginal improvements over no fine-tuning baselines at best. A 2% improvement in move-matching over the baseline means the model predicts an additional move correctly *in every 50 moves*! Is this even meaningful?\n- Overall, I'm slightly suspicious that any fine-tuning is required after prototype matching. Chess is such a closed domain that there should really be quite a small number of \"styles\" or prototypes for each skill level. With a sufficient number of prototypical players and a good prototype classifier, you should do really well with prototype matching alone. One experiment I would suggest is assuming access to an \"oracle\" prototype classifier that always outputs the best prototype player, and compute the max move prediction performance among all prototype players."

A prototype-matching meta-network is used to identify the prototype player most similar to the target player\uff0cwhich is essential for efficient fine-tuning with limited data.

                "value": "1. Overall, I find certain aspects of the methodology presentation unclear. The study builds on Maia-2, but several settings from Maia-2 need further explanation. For example, in Section 3.1, population embeddings are introduced, but there is no explanation of how Maia-2's predictions are adjusted solely by varying these embeddings. A brief overview of how Maia-2 works with population embeddings would be helpful. Additionally, in Section 3.2, more detail is needed on the population embeddings and player embeddings, specifically how these matrices are generated and adjusted.\n\n\n2. This method builds on Maia-2 improvements and enables behavior modeling for new players with less data; however, within this framework, training is still required for each player, making the process time-consuming and less scalable for larger populations. The framework\u2019s overall level of innovation is somewhat limited. I was expecting more discussions about how to address the scalability issue and make the per-player training more efficient."

It would be helpful to provide more specific details on how this structure uses History Embeddings to match similar Prototypical Player Embeddings.\n\n4. In Section 3.4.2, prototypical player embeddings are compared with aggregated action embeddings to find the most similar prototypical players. I was expecting the authors to provide quantitative results on the prototype matching accuracy."
