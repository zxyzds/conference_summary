    "abstract": "This paper introduces Network-based Active Inference (NetAIF), a novel framework that integrates random attractor dynamics and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to improve trajectory generation and control in robotics. NetAIF optimizes the intrinsic dynamics of neural networks, enabling robots to quickly adapt to dynamic and complex real-world environments with minimal computational resources and without the need for extensive pre-training. Unlike traditional learning methods that rely on large datasets and prolonged training periods, NetAIF offers a more efficient alternative. \n\nIn real-world scenarios, such as Photovoltaic (PV) panel inspections, NetAIF demonstrates its ability to execute dynamic tasks with both high efficiency and robustness. The system excels in unpredictable environments while maintaining a low computational footprint. These capabilities make NetAIF a promising solution for industrial applications, offering cost-effective, adaptive robotic systems that can reduce operational expenses and enhance performance, particularly in sectors like energy, where adaptability and precision are crucial.",

Also the actual \"visual inspection\" is not addressed. \n\n- The introduction discusses deep RL systems, but the paper does no comparison against any of those, but refers to another paper in the conclusion.\n\n- The methodology section lacks detail, making it challenging to reproduce the work. Comparative analysis with traditional control methods in particular for visual servoing, which are well-established for inspection tasks, is also absent.\n\n- The paper lacks a formal proof of system stability. To verify stability, the authors might consider using Lyapunov\u2019s stability criteria. Identifying a well-defined Lyapunov function could reveal whether trajectories converge to an attractor, A(\u03c9), suggesting stability."

How does the current approach account for or avoid collisions?\n\n- The statement \u201cthe random attractor dynamically explores within the constraints set by the control law\u201d raises some questions:\n  - How are these constraints practically defined?\n  - What control law ensure that exploration remains controlled and the robot behaves predictably during this process?\n\n- The pseudo algorithm suggests that prediction errors are minimized by randomly sampling new weights, with updates only occurring if the input surpasses a certain threshold. A few points to clarify:\n  - How is this threshold determined?\n  - Why is this threshold-based sampling considered an optimal method for weight updates?\n  - What does it mean to reset a weight? Is it reset to a default value? If so, which value?\n\n - \u201cThe joint pose was directly fed into the system, and the attractor calculated waypoints for a smooth and efficient trajectory to the specified pose,\u201d:\n   - What specifically is the simple control law\u2014is it a linear law?\n   - How are waypoints computed? Is it a linear interpolation between current and target joint angles?\n   - Why is there not a single goal-based attractor, and does the choice affect stability?\n\n- The text states that \u201cnoise affecting the system at time t is related to past noise.\u201d Does this formulation assume a colored noise model?\n\n- Based on Table I, the robotic arm with 6 DOF has a position accuracy of 14 mm from a fixed base. While this may suffice for inspecting large panels, it is insufficient for precision tasks, like assembly, which require sub-millimeter accuracy."

More rigid convergence or stability analyses are needed.\n\n4. Experimental details need to be added. For example, the accurately measured states, noised states, and unknown states in Section 3.1 should be clearly provided.\n\n5. An ablation study is needed. It seems that the proposed framework consists of several parts. The functionality of each part needs to be quantified. For example, the efficiency of the replaced discrete weight-assigning mechanism is unknown. \n\n6. The limitations should be analyzed finally. It is highly recommended to provide the source code."
