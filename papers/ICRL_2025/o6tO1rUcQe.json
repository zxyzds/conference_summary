    "abstract": "Weather prediction is crucial for decision-making in various social and economic sectors. The classical numerical weather prediction methods cannot incorporate the historical observations to enhance the underlying physical models, whereas the existing data-driven, deep learning-based weather prediction methods disregard either the $\\textbf{physics}$ of the weather evolution or the $\\textbf{topology}$ of the Earth's surface. In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. Therefore, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. These building blocks constitute a deep learning-based, $\\textbf{physics-assisted}$ and $\\textbf{topology-informed}$ weather prediction model. In the $5.625^\\circ$-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42.",

The architecture of PASSAT, particularly the internal workings of the spherical GNN and the interaction between the \u201cinteraction branch\u201d and \u201cvelocity branch,\u201d is not sufficiently detailed. A more detailed architectural diagram and step-by-step explanation would make the model\u2019s structure and operation easier to understand and potentially reproduce.\n\n2. The combination of a spherical GNN and Navier-Stokes equations implies high computational demands. The paper does not provide benchmarks for computational efficiency, which is crucial for real-world applications. \n\n3. The benchmarks should include the SOTA Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, which are the industry standard for accuracy and robustness in weather forecasting.\n\n4. While Navier-Stokes equations are employed to capture fluid dynamics on a global scale, the work does not clarify how it manages varying boundary conditions across different geographical or atmospheric regions. \n\n5. **(Major concern)** Although the paper employs the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations for physical realism, it does not provide a theoretical justification for their selection over other possible fluid dynamics models. Moreover, it is unclear how PASSAT addresses the variability and abrupt changes often observed in real-world data, which may not always align with the idealized assumptions of the NS framework. For instance, sudden atmospheric shifts and noise present in observational data could challenge the applicability and robustness of the NS-based approach in capturing highly dynamic or turbulent weather events."

The experiment only utilized T2m, 10u, 10v, Z500, T850 from ERA5 as input and target variables, leading to two major problems:\n   - These variables are not at the same altitude, which impedes the accurate application of the Navier-Stokes equation to velocity and temperature observations at varying heights. The ablation experiment further indicated that introducing the Navier-Stokes equation did not significantly improve the prediction.\n   - Regarding the incorporation of temperature, existing methods of embedding physical equations such as NeuralGCM[1] consider the thermal dynamics introduced by temperature variations and employ the more commonly accepted primitive equations for physical modeling.\n2. The author only used 13 years of ERA5 data with a spatial resolution of 5.625\u00b0 for their experiment, which is a relatively simple prediction task. It is recommended that the authors use the highest resolution data of 1.40625\u00b0 available in WeatherBench to enrich their dataset.\n3. When compared to GraphCast, the proposed method hdemonstrated a marginal improvement of approximately 1%. In the ablation experiment, the inclusion of Navier-Stokes equations and advection equations resulted in only a modest  performance promotion, which does not validate the effectiveness of the author's design.\n\n[1] Neural General Circulation Models for Weather and Climate. https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07222"

How does the author view this impact?\n\n2. Due to the timeliness of climate prediction, the training time and inference time of the model are also very important evaluation indicators. The author mentioned that PASSAT has the characteristic of less computational complexity. Can you give a specific comparison of training time and inference time?\n\n3. The author mentioned \"To be specific, we no longer trust the velocity field v estimated by the velocity branch of the spherical graph neural network, except for the initial time t. Instead, we solve the Navier-Stokes equation that governs the evolution of the velocity field, to calculate v.\" So how exactly does the author \"no longer trust the velocity field v\"?\n\n4. An extra ablation experiment can be designed to further demonstrate the difference between using a spherical graph neural network and a normal planar graph neural network.\n\n5.

The idea of using both the advection equation and Navier-stokes in a hybrid model like this is novel, and shows a way to take one step further in the physics direction than e.g. the ClimODE model.\n3. The authors have accurately identified that many deep learning weather models do not properly handle the spherical geometry of earth. In the proposed model this is remedied in a satisfying way both in the physics equations and in the deep learning component of the model.\n4.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**Major**:\n1. My biggest doubt about this work is about the role of the physics part in the hybrid model. Looking at table 2, the version of the model w/o Navier-Stokes achieves similar or even better results. Going even further, the version of the model without the physics-component (last column, pure GNN) shows only slightly worse RMSE values than the full PASSAT model. Crucially, this pure GNN version still substantially outperforms all baselines except GraphCast*. The conclusion to draw from this is that the most important part of the model seems to be the GNN, and the authors have mainly developed a very good GNN model, rather than a model that crucially relies on the physics equations. This could of course be a contribution in itself, but is not the focus of the paper as is. There is furthermore very little description of how this GNN component of the model works, which is a shame given how important it seems to be experimentally. The framing of the paper could be changed to highlight more this contribution, but that would change the shape of the paper enough that it would warrant a resubmission.\n2. The authors write in the list of contributions that \"PASSAT ... remarkably improves the stability of medium-term prediction\". There are no experiments to back this up. Stability is mentioned also in section 3.5, but there is no investigation of the stability of the model. The existing experiments are conducted up to 5 days, while most deep learning weather models are stable to roll out up to 10 days or beyond, so there is no support for this being an improvement in stability. Explicit experiments on how stable the different models are for long rollouts could shed some light on this. \n3. I am missing important related work, that should be discussed:\n  * ML Weather models handling the spherical geometry: (Bonev et al., 2023), (Esteves et al., 2023)\n  * Graph-based models: (Keisler, 2022), (Lam er al., 2023), (Oskarsson et al., 2024), (Lang et al., 2024). Given that the deep learning component of the model is a GNN, I would expect some mention of existing graph-based approaches and discussion about how the model relates. Lam et al. (2023) is mentioned heavily throughout the paper, but I miss a proper discussion about how the GNN used in PASSAT relates to GraphCast. \n4. The proposed model shows similar performance to the GraphCast* model. GraphCast has been reimplemented for this study, which is completely fair, but I wonder how close GraphCast* follows the original GraphCast model? In Table. 5 the number of nodes in GraphCast* is listed as 4096, which is 2 * 2048 (the number of grid points in the data). I don't see how you would arrive at this by summing the 2048 grid nodes with nodes in a multi-scale mesh graph constructed as described by Lam et al. (2023). If the graph used by GraphCast* in the paper is not such a icosahedral multi-scale graph this does not seem like a fair representation of the GraphCast model. This becomes important as GraphCast is the closest baseline competitor to the proposed method. I would appreciate if the authors could clarify this. \n5. The motivation for introducing the Navier-stokes equations is unclear. This is motivated by the GNN predictions leading to error accumulation, but would not heavy error accumulation be remedied by the rollout training scheme being used?\n\n**Minor** (not important for my final rating):\n1. When discussing the importance of considering the spherical geometry, it would be a stronger argument to point to explicit problems in existing models that do not, rather than only conceptual issues. An argument can be made that flexible deep learning models can learn to correct for the problems caused by disregarding the geometry. See for example how Pangu still provides physical predictions close to the poles. An example of this not working out can be found in Bonev et al. (2023), and the discussion there is an example of a more concrete motivation for considering the geometry.\n2. While I agree that existing models do not respect earth's *topology*, the fact that the earth is a sphere is even an aspect of *geometry*. I think this would be a better terminology to use.\n3. The paper discusses the role of the deep learning component as modeling the earth-atmosphere interactions. I interpret earth-atmosphere interactions as interaction between the earth's surface and the atmosphere just above it. In reality, this second component of the model seems to take the role of parametrizations of all kinds of unresolved processes happening on sub-grid scales. The terminology and exact meaning of earth-atmosphere interactions should be clarified.\n4. The authors write (about pure deep learning models): \"Thus, their predictions are often unreliable due to the lack of the physical constraints or suffer from the distortions caused by the topological structure\". I would argue that this is not an accurate statement for modern deep learning weather models, that tend to be reliably quite accurate and stable. The citation given to back this statement up is (Schultz et al., 2021), which is an earlier work than almost every single deep learning model discussed in the rest of this paper.\n5. Sections 1.1 and 1.2 read as related work subsections, and would feel more at home as part of that section. \n6. As opposed to what is written in the paper, GraphCast, Pangu and NeuralGCM have provided open code. Now there might be other good reasons to reimplement these for this study, but this should be clarified.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n* Bonev, Boris, et al. \"Spherical fourier neural operators: Learning stable dynamics on the sphere.\" International conference on machine learning.

                "value": "1. Comparing the continuity equation used in ClimODE with the advection equation used here, the difference seems to be that you exclude the compression part. This should correspond to an assumption that the flow is incompressible. What is the motivation for this choice? Is this well-motivated for the earth's atmosphere?\n2. Is my understanding correct that all equations (advection and Navier Stokes) are applied to each weather variable $u$ independently, and all interactions between them happen in the deep learning component? How can one then think of the u and v wind components? Is it reasonable to assume that these independently follow the advection equation? Not being an expert on these physical equations, my intuition would rather be that the wind components would have a close connection to the actual transport of at least the geopotential field. Could you comment on this? \n3. In algorithm 1 you introduce a $\\lambda$ that controls the update of the velocity field. With the value given, only $\\frac{1}{60}$ weight is given to the updated value from Navier Stokes. The motivation given for this is to ensure stability. Could you expand on this choice? Is there a physical motivation for this? It seems like this could be one reason why the introduction of Navier Stokes has very little impact in the ablation study."
