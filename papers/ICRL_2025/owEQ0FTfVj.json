    "title": "GlycanML: A Multi-Task and Multi-Structure Benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Glycans are basic biomolecules and perform essential functions within living organisms. The rapid increase of functional glycan data provides a good opportunity for machine learning solutions to glycan understanding. However, there still lacks a standard machine learning benchmark for glycan property and function prediction. In this work, we fill this blank by building a comprehensive benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning (GlycanML). The GlycanML benchmark consists of diverse types of tasks including glycan taxonomy prediction, glycan immunogenicity prediction, glycosylation type prediction, and protein-glycan interaction prediction. Glycans can be represented by both sequences and graphs in GlycanML, which enables us to extensively evaluate sequence-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs) on benchmark tasks. Furthermore, by concurrently performing eight glycan taxonomy prediction tasks, we introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms. Also, we evaluate how taxonomy prediction can boost other three function prediction tasks by MTL. Experimental results show the superiority of modeling glycans with multi-relational GNNs, and suitable MTL methods can further boost model performance.",

The benchmark is highly relevant for advancing glycan-related machine learning research, offering a platform to assess various models on tasks that are both scientifically and practically significant in fields like immunology and molecular biology.\n2. **Well-written paper; addressing each detail of GLYCANML thoroughly**. The paper is comprehensive, including detailed dataset construction, task definitions, and experimental protocols. It also provides a robust comparison of baseline models, which supports its claims of model performance and suitability.\n3. **High benchmark quality: multiple tasks and diverse modalities provided; allowing multitask learning and multimodal training**. The *GLYCANML-MTL* setup for multi-task learning offers a unique opportunity to test MTL methods in a real-world scenario with related biological tasks, demonstrating the potential to improve performance through shared learning."

However, for machine learning, it is not clear how this dataset is different from previous ones and what new insights it can bring to the domain of graph learning or multi-task learning.\n2. **Lack of Multimodal Encoders**. The benchmark has sequence and graph representation, and it is good to show the performance of multimodal molecular encoders like MolFormer [1].\n3. **More Pretrained Model Performance**. The paper did not explicitly say whether using the checkpoints for Graphormer or not, and if indeed using the pretrained checkpoint, it will also surpise me that a pretrained model even fail to match the standard sequence models and graph models. Also, other pretrained models, such as MolCLR [2], can be presented.\n\n[1] Ross, Jerret, et al. \"Large-scale chemical language representations capture molecular structure and properties.\" _Nature Machine Intelligence_ 4.12 (2022): 1256-1264.\n[2] Wang, Yuyang, et al. \"Molecular contrastive learning of representations via graph neural networks.\" _Nature Machine Intelligence_ 4.3 (2022): 279-287."
