    "title": "Learning to Discover Regulatory Elements for Gene Expression Prediction",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of predicting gene expressions from DNA sequences. A key challenge of this task is to find the regulatory elements that control gene expressions. Here, we introduce Seq2Exp, a Sequence to Expression network explicitly designed to discover and extract regulatory elements that drive target gene expression, enhancing the accuracy of the gene expression prediction. Our approach captures the causal relationship between epigenomic signals, DNA sequences and their associated regulatory elements. Specifically, we propose to decompose the epigenomic signals and the DNA sequence conditioned on the causal active regulatory elements, and apply an information bottleneck with the Beta distribution to combine their effects while filtering out non-causal components. Our experiments demonstrate that Seq2Exp outperforms existing baselines in gene expression prediction tasks and discovers influential regions compared to commonly used statistical methods for peak detection such as MACS3.",

                "value": "In this paper the authors have highlighted the importance of gene expression\u00a0as the fundamental process in biology, and have introduced a framework\u00a0for predicting gene expressions by leveraging causal relationships between DNA sequences, epigenomic signals and regulatory\u00a0elements or motifs. They have provided viability\u00a0of this approach over two cell types and also state that adding the \"extra info\" in form of epigenomic signals is not always useful and may act as noise in some prediction tasks. To agree on generalization of this approach it has to be tested on more cell types and diverse epigenomic data."

                "value": "When I compare this paper with other benchmarks (except EPInformer) in the field and for the same problem definition - I would rate this paper as high in terms of originality & significance. Yes, this work shows that gene expression prediction is not a siloed process, and that there are causal relationships between DNA sequences, epigenomic data, regulatory elements, and surrounding causal / non-causal parts of the input data. Also, deep learning algorithms can learn from these relationships and perform better gene expression predictions."

                "value": "This follows from my comments on the strengths of the paper. After reading the EPInformer paper (released in early 2024), my rating reduces. Was this idea a new approach? I respectfully decline. EPInformer highlights the same intent, experimental approach and even comes very close in performance benchmarks & standard metrics. Not sure if this paper has added anything new for the ICLR community? To me as a reader, it has only reinforced the claims of EPInformer. I would have been happier if they can show viability\u00a0of this approach\u00a0over multiple cell types. But, data availability may be a limitation here."

                "value": "Table 1 shows good comparison\u00a0with previously available\u00a0benchmark models and datasets. However, looking at EPInformer row, my question is did the authors run the EPInformer code or model over the CAGE prediction data? Because I only saw Pearson metric in the EPInformer paper. How were they able to get MSE, MAE, R2 numbers for comparison?\n\nIn the same table, GM12878 CAGE prediction numbers between EPInformer and Seq2Exp are exactly the same at two decimal places (not a significant improvement). This also indicates that the approach\u00a0presented\u00a0in the two papers is very similar. Neither one is better than the other. Originality in terms of problem\u00a0definition and solution\u00a0is also similar.\n\nAlso, some numbers do not match between the EPInformer row in this paper and the original EPInformer paper. For example, in the original EPInformer paper, figure 2C, Pearson coefficient\u00a0for K-562 on CAGE-seq hold out test set is 0.848. But, the same info in Seq2Exp paper, table 1, says is 0.8517.

The architecture is sound, and uses information bottleneck principle to promote sparsity of the mask for selecting sequence regions, and then a straight-through estimator to allow differentiability through the hard mask being produced by the first network.\n\nExperimental evaluation shows that the proposed architecture leads to improved prediction, in comparison with Transformer- and State-space-based models."

It's not clear, from the description, how the inputs are registered to the output value Y.  Is the idea that the length-L input window is centered on the TSS?  To my mind, it would be clearer to represent Y as a vector over genes, and then include some formalism to represent the indexing of genes relative to X_{seq} and X_{sig}.\n\nLine 420 (\"Furthermore, we incorporate additional features such as mRNA half-life and promoter activity ...\") is problematic because it sounds like this is an incomplete list.  For reproducibility, all inputs should be precisely described.  These features are not mentioned at all in Appendix A.3.\n\nI don't see any point in using both R and R^2 as two distinct performance measures.

How does your model handle this?\n\nSection 5.1.2 does not make clear whether the competing methods were trained using your cross-chromosome train/test splits.  Is that the case?  I think you should clarify this point in the paper and also discuss how it may impact your results.  If you trained from more or a different type of data than your competitors, the comparison might be unfair.  OTOH,  if your competitors trained on data from your test chromosomes, then it might be unfair in the other direction.\n\nI like the idea of Section 5.3, but I had trouble understanding exactly what was done here.

A matrix of size #base pairs x #regions that contains the frequency of contacts between the region to which a base pair belongs and all other regions?
