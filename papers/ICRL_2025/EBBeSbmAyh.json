    "title": "Towards Constraint-aware Learning for Resource Allocation in NFV-enabled Networks",
    "abstract": "Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that refers to resource allocation associated with hard and multifaceted constraints in network function virtualization (NFV). Existing works for VNE struggle to handle such complex constraints, leading to compromised system performance and stability. In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{CON}straint-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{L}earning framework for VNE, named \\textbf{CONAL}, to achieve efficient constraint management. Concretely, we formulate the VNE problem as a constrained Markov decision process with violation tolerance. This modeling approach aims to improve both resource utilization and solution feasibility by precisely evaluating solution quality and the degree of constraint violation. We also propose a reachability-guided optimization with an adaptive reachability budget method that dynamically assigns budget values. This method achieves persistent zero violation to guarantee the feasibility of VNE solutions and more stable policy optimization by handling instances without any feasible solution. Furthermore, we propose a constraint-aware graph representation method to efficiently learn cross-graph relations and constrained path connectivity in VNE. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

                "value": "1. The paper models the VNE problem as a violation-tolerant CMDP and introduces an adaptive reachability budget (ARB) to handle unsolvable instances. However, when dealing with unsolvable instances, no policy can satisfy the constraints, the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb may tend to infinity, leading to numerical instability during training. Instability may affect the policy's performance on solvable instances. Provide empirical evidence of the behavior of the Lagrange multiplier \u03bb during training. Specifically, plot the variation of \u03bb over training iterations or time to illustrate how it evolves, especially in the presence of unsolvable instances.\n2. The augmentation methods used in the path-bandwidth contrast module (physical link addition \u03d5A  and virtual link addition \u03d5B) lack sufficient theoretical and empirical justification. The choice of augmentation ratio \u03f5 significantly affects model performance, but the paper does not provide detailed analysis or guidelines for selecting these parameters. Provide theoretical explanations for how the augmentation methods contribute to improved bandwidth awareness. \n3. The integration of virtual and physical networks into a heterogeneous graph with numerous cross-graph links can lead to information redundancy and noise. Noise from irrelevant links can hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations.\n4. The experiments are mainly conducted on simulated environments and limited network topologies (e.g., GEANT and BRAIN). This may not adequately demonstrate the model's performance.\n5. Given the rapid development of NFV, some relevant literatures are missing to be discussed, e.g., NFVdeep: Adaptive Online Service Function Chain Deployment with Deep Reinforcement Learning, iwqos\u201919; Adaptive VNF Scaling and Flow Routing with Proactive Demand Prediction, infocom\u201918; FlexNFV: Flexible Network Service Chaining with Dynamic Scaling, network\u201919; Joint Optimization of Chain Placement and Request Scheduling for Network Function Virtualization, icdcs\u201917, etc."

                "value": "Overall\uff0cwhen infeasible instances exist in the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem (i.e., there are no embedding solutions that satisfy all constraints), the optimization method employed in the paper causes the Lagrange multipliers (\u03bb) to grow unbounded during training. The unbounded growth of \u03bb leads to overflows or underflows in numerical calculation. The paper does not provide a robust method for detecting infeasible instances, nor does it implement any controls or mitigations for the growth of \u03bb. This oversight means that, when faced with infeasible instances, the model may fail to operate correctly."

To be impactful, there is the need that novel solutions in the field do not propose only an algorithmic solution but also the design and implementation of a prototype integrated into real cloud/edge deployment environments. Otherwise, the level of technical originality and relevance could only be limited, given the status of maturity of the research field\n- The paper does not include in-depth technical insights about how to exactly achieve an effective and efficient design/implementation of the proposed solution into a real prototype. No lessons learned from the experience of real deployment and evaluation in in-the-field deployment scenarios\n- No systems engineering considerations and lessons learned about how to optimally configure and deploy the proposed solution\n- The reported performance results are obtained by adopting simulation assumptions that are too simplistic and not realistic for many real deployment environments. I can understand that other papers in the literature have adopted a similar approach, but this is too simplistic. At least the validity of the used assumptions should be better justified and motivated. In addition, why not using real traces from real deployment environments, in particular for request demands?\n- Insufficient performance results about the latency introduced by the proposed solution. It is true that for large-scale deployment environments the response time of the proposed solution is better than other baselines, but the Authors do not focus on which is exactly the latency in low-medium scale scenarios: for several application domains, a latency of around 2s could be considered excessive and it is not clear, given the scale of the y axis in Figure 8, which are exactly the number of ms that are more common for classical deployment environments. Which limitations stem from that? For which application domains is the proposed solution not feasible?\n- Even if the paper is generally well organized and well written, a few writing inaccuracies are still present in the manuscript and call for some minor revision work in order to improve the paper presentation style. Only to mention one example: \"Addtional\" in page 24."
