    "title": "Enhancing single-cell Multi-Modal Multi-Task Learning via Sparse Mixture-of-Experts",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in measuring high-dimensional modalities, including protein levels and DNA accessibility, at the single-cell level have prompted the need for frameworks capable of handling multi-omics data while simultaneously addressing multiple tasks. Despite these advancements, much of the work in the single-cell domain remains limited, often focusing on either a single-modal or single-task perspective. A few recent studies have ventured into multi-omics and multi-task learning, but we identified a \u2460 Optimization Conflict issue, leading to suboptimal results when integrating additional modalities, which is undesirable. Furthermore, there is a \u2461 Costly Interpretability challenge, as current approaches predominantly rely on costly post-hoc methods like SHAP. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce scMoE, a novel framework that, for the first time, applies Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) within the single-cell domain. This is achieved by incorporating an SMoE layer into a transformer block with a cross-attention module. Thanks to its design, scMoE inherently possesses mechanistic interpretability, a critical aspect for understanding underlying mechanisms when handling biological data. Furthermore, from a post-hoc perspective, we enhance interpretability by extending the concept of activation vectors (CAVs). Extensive experiments on simulated dataset, Dyngen, and real-world multi-omics single-cell datasets, including DBiT-seq, Patch-seq, ATAC-seq, demonstrate the effectiveness of scMoE.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture into the scaled dot-product attention mechanism, offering a new multi-task learning approach for single-cell multi-omics analysis. The SMoE architecture provides a natural solution to enhance model interpretability and mitigate optimization conflicts, both of which are critical challenges in multi-modal and/or multi-task learning. Specifically, scMoE consists of $\\mathcal{V}$ encoders which map the multi-modal data into embeddings with consistent shape. These embeddings are then passed into the SMoE-infused transformer block to learn intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. Finally, $\\mathcal{V}$ decoders are used to generate reconstructions based on the learned embeddings from the transformer block. The proposed model is evaluated using both simulation study and real-world experiments to demonstrate its performance on the two tasks mentioned in the paper (i.e., joint group identification and cross-modal prediction)."

                "value": "Unfortunately the presented manuscript has a significant number of major issues that prevent me from recommending acceptance at this time. Details of my major concerns are below:\n\n* **Missing experimental details:** The writing in the manuscript appears rushed, and is missing many experimental details. For example, what exact task corresponds to the results presented in Table 1? The caption mentions ARI, but the text never specifies what the ARI is being computed with respect to (e.g. cell type?). Are these labels obtained from the dyngen simulator? As another example, the authors mention an \"Identification only\" baseline method, but never specify any further details as to what this method entails.\n* **Hyperparameter tuning:** In Appendix C the authors provide hyperparameter details for their method, and it appears that different settings were used for each dataset for scMoE. How were these parameters chosen? Without further justification it's impossible for the reader to know if such parameters were picked in a principled manner or were cherry-picked. This is especially concerning as the authors mention default parameters were used for all baseline methods.\n* **Baseline methods/implementations:** Many of the baseline methods (e.g. those presented in Table 1) are not designed for the tasks that the authors applied them to. For example, totalVI's probabilistic model assumes paired RNA and surface protein measurements. Thus, it's not clear to me how the authors e.g. applied totalVI with only RNA or only protein measurements, and many of these comparisons seem unfair. Similarly, I'm not sure how one would apply the weighted nearest neighbors (WNN) method with only a single modality. Such issues may partially explain the significantly degraded performance of baseline methods compared to the authors' proposed method. To illustrate the merits of their approach, the authors should benchmark against methods that are actually designed for the corresponding tasks under consideration (e.g. for RNA-only experiments scVI could be used).\n* **Underwhelming interpretability results**: The authors claim that previous methods for analyzing single-cell multi-omics data suffer from a lack of interpretability, but it's not clear to me how scMoE is a significant improvement on this front. The authors don't present any significant new insights derived from the expert activations/multi-headed attention mechanisms beyond perhaps giving some insight into their model's behavior (e.g. expert X uses modalities Y and Z). Moreover, TCAV isn't specific to the authors' proposed method and could be applied to any baseline model. Finally, some of the baselines noted in this work (e.g. MOFA) are linear methods, and thus are inherently far more interpretable. The bottom line is: what **new** insights does interpreting scMoE provide that couldn't be obtained with previous workflows?"

If the authors can fully address my questions, I may consider improving the score.\n\n1. I believe that there have been many methods using MoE design for multi-modal data analysis [1-3]. Could the authors explain why they do not consider these methods into benchmarking analysis? And what is the difference between these methods and your method? I am pretty confused about the novelty here.\n\n2. I do not find the information of hyper-parameter tuning for your methods and baselines. How can you ensure that your comparison is based on the optimal setting of different methods? Also, I wonder how do you compare the dense methods with MoE design and what is the difference of their scale. If the dense model has less parameter size with the MoE design, is it a fair comparison?\n\n3. There are several benchmarking studies for single-cell multi-omic integration or label transformation. According to their study, it is necessary to include more baselines, including GLUE [4] and Seurat [5] (which is different from the WNN mentioned in this setting, I believe that the given WNN setting is from mudata, not from Seurat. Seurat is more complicated). \n\n4. The current metrics only cover the label matching performances, but not the distance of different clusters. Therefore, I think the authors should include NMI or ASW for the clustering comparison. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(21)00123-5\n\n[2] https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009086\n\n[3] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9778475\n\n[4] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01284-4\n\n[5] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29608179/"
