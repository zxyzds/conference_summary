    "title": "Revisiting Covariate and Hypothesis Roles in ITE Estimation: A New Approach Using Laplacian Regularization",
    "abstract": "The recent surge in data availability across many fields, such as medicine, social science, and marketing, has brought to the forefront the problem of estimating Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) from observational data to effectively tailor treatment to personalized characteristics. ITE estimation is known to be a challenging task because we can only observe the outcome with or without treatment, but never both. Moreover, observational datasets exhibit selection bias induced by the treatment assignment policy. In this paper, we present a new approach consisting of two novel aspects. First, we depart from conventional approaches that minimize the covariate shift. Instead, we incorporate it as a crucial element in ITE estimation, recognizing that it stems from highly predictive features that exhibit significant imbalance in observational data. Second, unlike existing methods, our approach utilizes hypothesis functions to directly estimate outcomes under covariate shift, enhancing reliability across observed and unobserved outcomes. To support this approach theoretically, we derive a new upper bound of the expected ITE loss and show that it explicitly depends on the discrepancy between the hypothesis functions, which are absent from the objectives of existing methods. Based on this new approach, we present LITE: Laplacian Individual Treatment Effect, a novel method that leverages Laplacian-regularized representation and incorporates both the covariate shift and the hypothesis functions for ITE estimation, effectively bridging observed and unobserved outcomes. We demonstrate LITE on illustrative simulations and two leading benchmarks, where we show superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

                "value": "This paper revisits a fundamental problem in causal inference: the estimation of the individual treatment effect (ITE). Many previous studies have been proposed to estimate the ITE and eliminate the selection bias. While most of them solved this issue by aligning the latent feature space and minimizing the covariate shift, this paper asserted the imbalance would be inherent and stem from the highly predictive features -- it directly impacts the causal treatment effect and should not be simply mitigated. This paper proposed a novel method to estimate the ITE by incorporating the covariate shift as a crucial element in ITE estimation and utilizing hypothesis functions to directly estimate the outcomes under the covariate shift. The experiments show great improvement in the performance of ITE estimation and comparable results in ATE estimation."

                "value": "W1: I am afraid the motivation for why the authors think their proposed LITE can obtain the goal is unclear. In Section 4, the proposed LITE is developed to enforce $h_t[i]$ and $h_t[l]$ are similar when the two samples are close in representation space, but it doesn't directly address the covariate shift, which should address the connections of $h_1(\\cdot)$ and $h_0(\\cdot)$, but I didn't see that in your method. \n\nW2: The illustration of the proposed LITE with Theorem 3 is weak. Within line 384 -400, the authors illustrate that their methods can achieve the proposed goal (controlling the PEHE based on Eq. 9) based on some arguments. However, these arguments are subjective and lack theoretical promise. \n\nW3: The practical use is somehow confusing. The method requires a proper $\\alpha$. Improper $\\alpha$ will lead to dramatically large errors (Figure 3 (a)). However, in practical use, there is no validation set and how to choose a proper $\\alpha$ is confusing."

                "value": "Q1: There is no explicit illustration of how minimizing the penalty Eq. 13 will reflect the covariate shift. The covariate shift should construct connections between $h_1$ and $h_0$. However they are separated in Eq. 13. The proposed method enforces the predictions $h_t$ to be close if the samples are close in representation space, but it doesn't address the covariate shift. \n\nQ2: The connections between the proposed methods and Theorem 3 are insufficient, based on arguments while lacking theoretical promise. \n\nQ3: In experiments, the authors only compare their methods with the naive method in simulation studies (Section 5.1), what if other baseline methods are applied to the simulation studies? can the authors illustrate more why the baseline methods cannot be applied to the simulation studies or supplement some studies to compare the performance? \n\nQ4: How to choose the proper $\\alpha$ in real-world application as there is no validation set (in observational studies, no counterfactual outcomes are available)? Do we need the RCT as validation studies (which would be expensive), or do the authors have additional solutions?"

Algorithm 1 is adding little value--- it is just about training their model.\n\nRe. regularization, I think the regularizer is using more of a similarity kernel rather than graph.

From my perspective, this term merely substitutes the overall distribution constraint of the IPM from [1] with a constraint on expected distributions. Essentially, it does not differ significantly from the IPM term; it still aligns the expected covariates for T=0 and T=1, failing to achieve the paper's stated motivation of avoiding covariate shift while focusing on hypothesis functions. This is unfortunate; it would be more effective if the paper directly constrained Equation (22) in Appendix A. Consequently, my concerns regarding this constraint lead me to be skeptical about the method designed based on it.\n\n- Additionally, there is a minor writing issue: Section 3.2 is titled \"THE SELECTION BIAS,\" yet lines 184-194 primarily discuss ITE learning. Only lines 195-198 briefly address selection bias, making the content misaligned with the section title.\n\n- The discussion of related work overlooks several significant studies. For instance, [2] introduces sample weights for weighted regression to address the negative impact of the IPM on outcome prediction. Study [3] incorporates a TR constraint based on representation learning to enhance robustness in outcome prediction. Additionally, [4] presents the concept of prognostic scores to directly ensure information about outcomes. Studies [5] and [6] introduce the double balancing score/representation concept, aiming to model shifts in covariate distributions while preserving predictive power for Y. Research on sufficient dimension reduction, such as [7], focuses on learning identifiable representations from covariates to retain essential information. Given these contributions, it is important to clarify the unique advantages of this paper in modeling outcome prediction information compared to these prior works.\n\n---\n\n[1] Shalit U, Johansson F D, Sontag D.
