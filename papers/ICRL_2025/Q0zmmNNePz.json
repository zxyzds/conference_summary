    "title": "Topograph: An Efficient Graph-Based Framework for Strictly Topology Preserving Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. \nIn this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a new loss function, called **Topograph**, for image segmentation, which aims to preserve the topological accuracy of predictions. The authors highlight the importance of **topological correction** in many segmentation tasks, especially in the medical domain where it is crucial for accurate diagnosis and functional analysis. The approach relies on the construction of a component graph that encodes the topological information of both the ground truth and the prediction. \n\nThe main innovations are:\n* **A DIU (Discrepancy between Intersection and Union) metric:** This new metric captures topological correctness with strict theoretical guarantees, notably by capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and the intersection of a label/prediction pair. The DIU metric is more sensitive to fine-grained topological differences than existing metrics such as the Betti number error and the Betti matching error.\n* **A graph-based loss function:** This general loss function preserves topology and can be used to train various segmentation networks. It is based on a component graph that combines topological information from the ground truth image and the prediction.\n* **Computational Efficiency:** Topograph outperforms existing methods in terms of topological correction of predictions while being efficient in terms of time and resources due to its low asymptotic complexity (O(n \u03b1(n)))."

The paper presents **theoretical guarantees** for Topograph, demonstrating that if their novel introduced loss is zero, then there is homotopy equivalence. This means that Topograph not only guarantees homotopy equivalence between the ground truth and the segmentation, but also between their union and intersection, thus capturing the spatial correspondence of their topological properties.\n\n2. The approach has a lower complexity than persistent-homotopy (PH) based ones, and, experimentally, a faster running time.  \n\n3. Experimental results show that Topograph improves topological accuracy compared to pixel-based loss functions and other topology-preserving approaches, as shown by the best scores on DIU and BM metrics. At the same time, it maintains pixel-level accuracy comparable to the best benchmarks, indicating that there is no trade-off between pixel-level accuracy and topological correctness."

The method is currently limited to 2D images. Its extension to 3D images is considered, but I believe it is not obvious to do. The component graph as currently defined is difficult to extend to 3D."

The authors may want to discuss some specific challenges they anticipate in extending Topograph to 3D, and to outline potential strategies they are considering to address these challenges.\n\nRegarding the binarization, I am wondering if it is possible to quantify or estimate how much topological information is lost through\nthe binarization approach compared to PH methods. Is it possible to suggest some strategy that mitigate this information loss while maintaining Topograph computational efficiency advantages?"

This confusion is furthered by Fig. 2 (see below) where such edge is actually present (so does \"nontrivial\" mean non-empty after all? but how is the comp. graph bipartite then?); Also, the respective edge is not present in Fig. 3. Please clarify.\n\n-- In Fig. 2 (bottom right) the prediction foreground appears double-thickened, while later you settle for double-thickening of ground truth foreground; this causes an edge between intersection and background in Fig. 2 which should not be there and causes confusion; The same edge is also present in Fig. 7.3 -- I do not understand why; Same holds for the edge from the rightmost (thin) FN component to the spurious component in Fig. 7.3, I do not understand why this is there -- shouldn't it go from the FN component directly to the background node? \n\nRe rel. work:\n\n-- E.g., how is the DIU metric related to the common practice of counting \"false split\" and \"false merge\" errors, as commonly done for segmentation problems (cf [1] for one out of many examples where these are evaluated)? Could it be that DIU is the sum of false splits and false merges (at least for dim. 0 features?)? If not, do you see any other relation?\n\n-- A discussion of [1] as related work appears warranted\n\n-- Funke et al. (2018) is listed in rel. work as having a PH-based loss function, but this is not correct? Please discuss in more detail the relation of your work to their loss, which also focuses on topologically critical regions that are spatially correct\n\n[1] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.12.013\n\nMinor: \n\n-- A pointer to Fig. 11 earlier in the text would be very helpful, latest on page 6 line 297 (in addition to pointing to Fig. 3)"
