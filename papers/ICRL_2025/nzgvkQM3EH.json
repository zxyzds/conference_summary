    "title": "Identification of Nonparametric Dynamic Causal Model and Latent Process for Climate Analysis",
    "abstract": "The study of causal structure learning with latent variables has advanced our understanding of the world by uncovering causal relationships and latent factors. However, in real-world scenarios, such as those in climate systems, causal relationships are often nonparametric, dynamic, and exist among both observed variables and latent variables. To address these challenges, we consider a general setting where causal relations are nonparametric and unrestricted in their occurrence. With the aid of three measurements in temporal structure, we theoretically show that both latent variables and processes can be identified up to minor indeterminacy under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we establish that the observed causal structure is identifiable if, roughly speaking, the latent variables induce sufficient variations in the noise terms. Based on these theoretical insights, we develop a principled estimation approach that simultaneously learns both the causal structure and latent representation. Experimental results on simulation studies validate the theoretical foundations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In the climate data experiments, we show that it offers a powerful and in-depth understanding of climate system.",

Could you provide a brief explanation of why the 3-Measurements Model was chosen over other options, and how it specifically relates to climate system analysis.\n\n2. The motivation and limitations of the proposed setting are unclear. There seems to be no time-lag effect among $x_{t-1}, x_t, x_{t+1}$. Could you clarify the implications of not including time-lag effects between the observed variables, and how this might impact the model's applicability to real-world climate systems.\n\n3. In Equation 2, $pa_{x_t}(x_{t,i})$ only includes parents $x_{t,j}$, where there is no time lag in $t$. Does this mean that the parent of $x_{t,i}$ is restricted to instantaneous cases in the observed space? If so, could you elaborate on the details in comparison with constraint-based methods, which allow for multiple time lags for observed variables but do not yield time-lagged causal structure among latent variables?"

What does the estimated DAGs look like in terms of the dimension of the observed variables? Are the estimated DAGs a full-time causal graph or a summary causal graph?\n\n8. In Table 3, is there a reason why the metric for the Independent and Sparse cases is MCC while the metric for the Dense case is $R^2$? Can all three cases be evaluated using both metrics?\n\n9. Could you also use F1, recall, and precision as metrics in the comparison shown in Figure 7?\n\n10. Are you assuming that there is no causal effect from future variables to past variables?"

The study introduces a comprehensive framework to identify and analyze these hidden causal processes under various assumptions, even in cases with nontrivial dynamics. The authors present a theoretical framework for identifying latent variables and causal structures within climate data, establishing conditions under which these variables can be detected when they induce significant variability. Through the novel Nonparametric Causal Discovery and Learning (NCDL) model, an extension of nonlinear Structural Equation Models (SEM) adapted for dynamic, time-based dependencies, they reframe SEM within a nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) structure to enhance causal identification. Validation on synthetic and CESM2 climate data demonstrates that NCDL outperforms traditional methods like FCI and PCMCI in accurately identifying latent variables and their relationships. This methodology, applied to sea surface temperatures and related climate variables, effectively identifies underlying factors such as CO2 levels and ocean currents, advancing insights into climate dynamics."

To the best of my knowledge, this approach is novel. Moreover, I also find the application of this framework to climate-specific variables, such as sea surface temperatures and CO\u2082 levels, very interesting. Both the theoretical and empirical contributions of this submission are sound. The authors provide identifiability results based on a set of assumptions, such as Functional Faithfulness. This theoretical contribution is complemented by comprehensive experimental validation across synthetic and real-world datasets, specifically with climate data from the Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2). By benchmarking their method against existing approaches like Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and PCMCI and showing consistent improvements, the paper provides strong evidence for the superiority of their approach. Overall, this submission is overall well-written and easy to follow. Furthermore, I believe that this contribution is significant to the field of Causal Inference, due to the novelty of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the application to climate analysis is broadly relevant."
