    "title": "Samba: Synchronized Set-of-Sequences Modeling for Multiple Object Tracking",
    "abstract": "Multiple object tracking in complex scenarios - such as coordinated dance performances, team sports, or dynamic animal groups - presents unique challenges. In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets.",

Providing clearer definitions of notations would be helpful.\n- I understand the intention to separate two paradigms tracking-by-detection (TBD) and tracking-by-propagation (TBP), but the difference is subtle as the TBP still needs bounding boxes to initiate the states, and needs a detector to recognize newly appearing objects. Then, propagation alone is simply not practical in this problem of multiple object tracking.\n- Then it should be fair to compare with TBD methods, and the performance still falls short behind classic motion models as reported in Table A.\n- While I value the effort in development, the innovation in the method appears to be limited, as it essentially represents a straightforward combination of MOTR and Mamba and the motivation is not really compelling."

However, the paper lacks any measurements to back up this claim. Overall, there is emphasis placed on efficiency in the paper, so it would be good to include some measurements and comparisons to show these points. For example, including peak memory requirements and FLOPS would illustrate this point. \n\n(3) While the method shows strong results, chiefly due to architectural modifications, it is worth asking whether efficiency gains enable larger (higher capacity) models, which lead to improvements or whether the SSMs formulation provides better biases for the tracking problem. While it might be difficult to disentangle such factors, the paper could help guide future research in this area by reporting some (albeit not great) proxies, such as learnable parameter counts, etc."
