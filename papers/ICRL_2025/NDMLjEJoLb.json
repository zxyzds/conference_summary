    "title": "Blending Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models using the Black Scholes Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Many image generation tasks, such as content creation, editing, personalization, and zero-shot generation, require generating unseen concepts without retraining the model or collecting additional data. These tasks often involve blending existing concepts by conditioning the diffusion model with text prompts at each denoising step, a process known as ``prompt mixing''. We introduce a novel approach for prompt mixing to forecasts predictions w.r.t. the generated image and makes informed text conditioning decisions at each time step during diffusion denoising. To do so, we leverage the connection between diffusion models (rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the Black-Scholes model for pricing options in Finance, and draw analogies between the variables in both contexts to derive an appropriate algorithm for prompt mixing using the Black Scholes model. Specifically, the parallels between diffusion models and the Black-Scholes model enable us to leverage properties related to the dynamics of the Markovian model derived in the Black-Scholes algorithm. Our prompt-mixing algorithm is data-efficient, meaning it does not need additional training.  Furthermore, it operates without human intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We highlight the benefits of our approach by comparing it, qualitatively and quantitatively using CLIP scores, to other prompt mixing techniques, including linear interpolation, alternating prompts, step-wise prompt switching, and CLIP-guided prompt selection across various scenarios such as single object per text prompt, multiple objects per text prompt and objects against backgrounds. The resulting code will be made publicly available for research reproduction.",

                "value": "This paper proposes an approach to enhance prompt mixing in diffusion models. It leverages the concepts from the Black-Scholes algorithm used in financial markets. The authors analyze the relationship between diffusion models and the Black-Scholes model. It uses the connect to develop a method to select optimal text prompts during the denoising process. The method aims to generate images that effectively blend multiple concepts without requiring additional training or data collection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baselines in both CLIP scores and qualitative comparisons across various settings."

The authors fail to rigorously demonstrate why the financial markets in the Black-Scholes model should apply to image generation. The mapping of concepts like \"strike price\" and \"risk-free rate\" to the image generation domain seems not very straightforward and intuitive.\n\n2. Limited evaluation metrics: The paper relies heavily on CLIP scores for quantitative evaluation. However, CLIP scores is not the optimal evaluation strategy due to their vulnerability to hallucination and bias issues. More robust evaluation metrics should be given to validate the proposed method. Besides, the improvement of CLIP score is also minimal.\n.\n3. Insufficient ablation studies: The ablation studies to justify the specific choices made in adapting the Black-Scholes model are not given. For instance, the authors set the strike price K to a constant value of 0.25 without exploring how different values might affect the results. Similarly, the choice of risk-free rate as 1/T is not adequately explained or validated through experiments."

From my perspective, $\\textbf{significant revisions are necessary}$, including the addition of substantial content and a reorganization of the structure. Therefore, $\\textbf{I lean towards recommending the rejection of this paper}$.\n\nPresentation(I only list several parts):\n\n1. Frankly speaking, the organization, the writing and the format of this paper are awful. It is difficult for the reviewers to understand the authors` motivation and so on. The cite format of this paper is totally wrong. $\\textbf{The authors make the wrong utilization of \\citep{} and \\citet{}}$, which can lead to desk reject of this paper.\n\n2. The content of the article is somewhat disorganized. When introducing the proposed method, the authors abruptly shift to discussing related work. I believe this section should have been addressed earlier in the text.\n\n3. Grammar mistakes and missing references.  In line 167, \"$\\textit{determine the price of European call options of assets. which is used to determine the price of European call options on assets}$\". Wrong commas and repeated sentences.  The authors only use the CLIP score to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, but no reference to the CLIP score.\n\nCLIPScore: A Reference-free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning\n\nMethod and Experiments:\n\n1. The proposed method is not novel, it just directly introduces the Black-Scholes model in fiance into diffusion models. The core of the proposed method is to select the optimal prompt to mix during each denoising step. The authors claim the difference between the proposed method and previous ones is the proposed method can connect to the dynamics of the diffusion denoising process. However, there is no evidence to show the superiority of the connection to the dynamics of the diffusion denoising process.\n\n2. In the conclusion part, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their method; however, I believe these issues must be addressed. First, the experimental section utilizes $\\textbf{only one evaluation metric and one diffusion model}$, resulting in a single experiment throughout the paper. This makes it difficult to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the intuitive results provided do not demonstrate any significant changes. Second, the authors state that $\\textbf{the method is currently applicable only to mixing two prompts}$, which clearly does not establish the method's scalability. Additionally, the pseudocode provided indicates that the time complexity of the proposed method approaches $O(n^2)$, raising doubts about its efficiency."
