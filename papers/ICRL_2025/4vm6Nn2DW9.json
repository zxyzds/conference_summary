    "title": "Exploring Temporal Semantic for Incomplete Clustering",
    "abstract": "Clustering data with incomplete features has garnered considerable scholarly attention; however, the specific challenge of clustering sequential data with missing attributes remains largely under-explored. Conventional heuristic methods generally address this issue by first imputing the missing features, thereby making the clustering results heavily reliant on the quality of imputation. In this paper, we introduce a novel clustering framework, termed ETC-IC, which directly clusters incomplete data with rigorous theoretical guarantees, whilst concurrently leveraging temporal semantic consistency to enhance clustering performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in clustering human motion data.",

                "value": "W1. The presentation of the paper is weak, lacking discussion, which makes it hard to follow. Concretely, the scope of the paper is unclear initially, going from clustering of missing features to subspace clustering and back. After that, the method and its properties are presented, without discussing how it relates to existing work, what motivates each step, and whether there are design alternatives.\nW2. The discussion of related work fails to convey which methods are related in terms of applicability to the problem under study or in terms of method similarities, and which are less closely related. Instead, the related work section lists technical aspects of different methods, without any assessment as to their suitability for the problem under study.\nW3. The empirical study is weak. In the experimental evaluation, only methods for clustering with missing data are studied, but none for clustering temporal data. As the datasets under study are characterised by strong temporal signals, the competitors are thus very weak baselines.\nW4. The paper fails to provide sufficient information about the setup in the experiments, and some details about the method are confusing. For example, for the experiment in Fig. 2, linear interpolation is used prior to running the method. This seems to contradict the purpose of the method of being able to handle missing data. Also, it is unclear if linear interpolation was also used prior to running the competitors. This should be clarified in the description, and experiments comparing with and without interpolation should be conducted.\nW5. The accuracy in several of the experiments is very high, close to 80%, even when half of the data is missing - indicating that the problem might be too easy for any temporal method (as stated above, none of them are considered here). The experimental evaluation should thus include temporal clustering methods as well, possibly using interpolation if necessary (as in W4). More challenging datasets, where missing data has a stronger impact on accuracy should be studied in order to understand the robustness of the method.\nW6. It is unclear how quickly the method converges in general, only one example is provided for one of the datasets. The paper should provide convergence results across datasets and runs."

Firstly, they adapt the proposed MAR and MNAR directly to the previous baselines without comparing the baselines\u2019 original performances. Secondly, one of the core concept in this paper: missing entries, are manually designed and generated rather than an off-the-shelf nature existing in the dataset. The results should also show how the model behaves on samples without missing entries to show the model\u2019s general capacity. Thirdly, the quantitative analysis is poor, where Figure 5 only showcases some samples while Figure 7 is a case study rather than quantitative analysis.\n\n(W2) Presentation -- Moreover, the presentation of the experiments is with many errors. Firstly, both Figure 1 and Figure 8 report results on 5 datasets, but the figure caption and paper introduce there are only 4 datasets instead of 5. Secondly, the introduction to Mocap is poor, where it doesn\u2019t introduce clearly what are the sequence data. Thirdly, Fig 2 (b) and Fig 3 (b) are with low quality. There is a clear obstruction between plot lines and bottom-left frames. Fourthly, the ablation study is reported in a Table but presented as a Figure (Figure 8). Also, the caption is on top of figure 8 while all the other captions for Figures stay in the bottom. \n\n(W3) Lack of guidance -- Besides the experiments, it\u2019s also very hard to comprehend the authors formal derivation, as there are very few intuitive explanations. Without a clear guidance and introduction to the data, the author directly introduces the formulas without elaborating how the symbols are connected to the data in this work. Later on, in the experiment, only a simple ablation study in Figure 8 shows the effectiveness of \u2018temporal semantics\u2019, while it doesn\u2019t analyze the effectiveness of theorem1 to 4 respectively, leaving it unknown which part of the theorem truly works, and which part might fail. Also, the theorem 3 is missing, where it is replaced by \u2018proposition 3\u2019."

Secondly, ETC-IC explores the temporal semantics inherent in sequential data by aligning data points and their temporal assignments through a temporal semantic consistency constraint, thereby ensuring that data points with similar temporal semantics are clustered together. The handling of missing data and the exploration of temporal semantics are unified within a single cohesive framework, thereby demonstrating the adaptability and versatility of the proposed method in addressing incomplete sequential data as required."
