    "title": "HuRi : Humanoid Robots Adaptive Risk-ware Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Robust Control",
    "abstract": "Due to the high complexity of bipedal locomotion, the locomotion control of humanoid robots requires precise adjustment of the balance system to adapt to the changing environment. This high dependence on balance makes the robot very sensitive to risky environments. Therefore, any slight change in the state of the environment may cause the robot to lose balance, thereby increasing the risk of falling or damage. In the past, few studies have explicitly incorporated risk factors into robot policy training, and have failed to adaptively adjust the risk perception level for different risky environmental states, which will affect the agent's exploration during training and thus fail to select the optimal action in the risky environment. We propose an adaptive risk-aware control policy(HuRi) based on value distributional reinforcement learning. This algorithm does not require additional modules, but only uses the environmental input and the calculated probability distribution, using IQR to measure the intrinsic uncertainty of the environment and RND to evaluate the parameter uncertainty of the environmental state. Combining these two uncertainties, the risk perception level of the strategy is adjusted by adjusting the scalar risk parameter of the distortion function. With this algorithm, the agent can explore safely and efficiently in the risky environment, adaptively adjust the risk sensitivity level of the agent by controlling different distortion measures of the reward distribution, and select the optimal action in the dynamic risky environment. We conducted simulation and actual deployment on the Zerith robot to verify the robustness of HuRi.",

                "value": "This paper presents an approach to training humanoid robots for locomotion in risky environments using deep reinforcement learning.  The key innovation is the development of an adaptive risk-aware distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, which allows adjusting risk sensitivity based on uncertainty in the environment.  This is achieved by combining intrinsic uncertainty, measured using the interquartile range, and parameter uncertainty, evaluated using random network distillation.  The proposed algorithm enables the robot to learn a robust locomotion control policy.  The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments on the Zerith robot, showing its ability to handle various disturbances such as sudden impacts, load variations, and uneven terrain"

The authors demonstrate through both simulated and real-world experiments that HuRi outperforms baseline methods, achieving better stability under various disturbances including external forces, heavy loads (up to 42% of body weight), and sudden impacts."

Recent work [1] has shown phase/clock-based rewards may not be optimal for robust locomotion. A comparison with alternate reward structures would strengthen their claims.\n    \n- Uncertainty measurement complexity: The combination of RND with distributional RL seems potentially involved. I did not quite understand the justification of why RND is needed on top of distributional uncertainty estimates. Did the authors try to explore whether simpler approaches could achieve similar results, for example just using RND?"

The main contribution of the paper is the usage of distributional RL as a method for controlling the risk that a humanoid's policy incurs during exploration and execution. The motivation of the risk-awareness in humanoid systems comes from the delicate and robust control that the actuators must execute on the robot in order to maintain stability. Finding these stable controllers is difficult and dangerous, so risk-awareness in the policy is necessary. The authors provide experiments on a simulated humanoid robot and real-world experiments."

They all are joined with the previous word. \n\nMajor issues:\n1. Presentation of method is unclear: throughout section 3, the authors introduce various components of their method. Because each component is described mainly in text, the structure of dependancies and framework is difficult to understand. Figure 2 is helpful, but not fully informative. I would suggest including an Algorithm Block that goes through each component step-by-step. Further, it would be helpful to include labels for all the equations/expressions that are splitting up the paragraphs throughout the method section\n2. Usage of $SR(\\lambda)$: This term is introduced around line 229 but never really described in great detail. In general, this paragraph from 226 to 240 is confusing and would benefit from being described through an algorithm block\n3. The quantile loss in line 241 does not include the distribution over which the expectations are being taken. \n4. MSE loss in line 247 has incorrect notation that make its meaning ambiguous (mismatched paranthesis)\n5. $g_\\beta^\\text{Wang}$ in line 254 is introduced without any additional supporting information. In the following paragraph, the authors describe the nuances of $\\beta$ but not where the function $g$ is ever used. Please clarify its position in the method.\n6. *Poor reward comparison experiment*: The results in Figure 3 do not include any error bars or indicate any notion of statistical significance. It is necessary for the authors to run these experiments over multiple seeds and report aggregated performance. Also, is reward the right metric of performance? I would imagine that violation of safety constraints is a more important feature to report on. \n7. Robot specific simulated experiments: While the results reported in the remainder of the simulated experiment section are important, they seem more like results that would be found in a pure robotics paper.\n8. Real world experiments lack statistical or more analytical significance. Please include some information on how the experiments show that the risk-awareness is important and that your instantiation of the risk-aware framework out performs other real-world methods. To do this, you might report success rates and safety violations that the varying methods exhibit."

                "value": "1) The paper presentation needs a lot of work. There are numerous small things and typos that add up and make the paper difficult to understand. First, the citations are not well formatted and this makes reading the manuscript difficult. Secondly, the notation is not consistent: sometimes $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is used for the state, and some other times $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is used for the state. Another example is that the paper is about humanoid robots and then in the theorem the authors state \"We describe the locomotion problem of quadruped robots\". Overall, the presentation and writing of the paper requires quite some work.\n\n2) As far as I can tell (given the difficulty of understanding the manuscript described above), the authors claim that the novelty lies in a) the usage of an adaptive mechanism for adapting the \u03b2 parameter of the distortion function, and b) the training of the RND network for \u03b2 adaptation. Although I can see value in the adaptation mechanism, the motivation of using the RND network is rather weak. Similarly, the evaluation and discussion on why it works better is again rather weak. I would have expected a more thorough discussion and analysis since RND seems to be the critical factor in the performance gains.\n\n3) The experimental section requires more work. For example, in Fig. 3 (and the describing text) we do not know if the authors ran just one training and smoothed out rewards or they ran multiple seeds and take some statistics. Similarly, for the experiments shown in Fig. 4, the authors do not mention how many seeds they used. They do mention the number of seeds for the experiments shown in Tab. 1. Overall, this goes back to presentation; the manuscript requires substantial work to make it understandable.\n\n4) In the current form, we cannot really evaluate the real-world experiments. Figures 6,7 and 8 do not showcase anything that is written in the text. We cannot validate what's happening here. The video showcases a lot of nice behaviors, but we need a more rigorous evaluation here. It is very difficult to evaluate the performance of the policy at the moment.\n\n5) I do not get how the proposed approach is specifically suited for humanoids (which the author attempt to motivate, but fail imho)."
