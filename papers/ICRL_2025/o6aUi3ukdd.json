    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing computational chemistry, bringing unprecedented innovation and efficiency to the field. To further advance research and expedite progress, we introduce the Quantum Open Organic Molecular (QO2Mol) database \u2014 a large-scale quantum chemistry dataset designed for professional and transformative research in organic molecular sciences under an open-source license. The database comprises 120,000 organic molecules and approximately 20 million conformers, encompassing 10 different elements (C, H, O, N, S, P, F, Cl, Br, I), with heavy atom counts exceeding 40. Utilizing the high-precision B3LYP/def2-SVP quantum mechanical level, each conformation was meticulously computed for quantum mechanical properties, including potential energy and forces. These molecules are derived from fragments of compounds in ChEMBL, ensuring their structural relevance to real-world compounds. Its extensive coverage of molecular structures and diverse elemental composition enables comprehensive studies of structure-property relationships, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of machine learning models in predicting molecular behaviors. The QO2Mol database and benchmark codes are available at https://github.com/ikovey/QO2Mol/.",

It contains 120,000 molecules and 20 million conformers (10 elements, >40 heavy atoms) with potential energy and forces calculated at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level. Derived from ChEMBL fragments, the dataset is divided into three subsets: A (20 million conformations, >110,000 molecules, equilibrium and near-equilibrium), B (2.4 million conformers, ~1,400 drug molecules, numerous heavy atoms), and C (dissimilar molecules). Benchmark results for potential energy prediction using various models are included. The dataset and code are available on GitHub."

It addresses a recognized need for a large and diverse quantum chemistry dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models in molecular sciences. The inclusion of benchmark results using established models provides a baseline for future research. The open-source availability of the dataset and code further encourages community engagement and broader application.\n\nHowever, the paper's strong focus on quantum chemistry methodologies and detailed discussions of molecular properties, conformations, and potential energy surfaces might be more suitable for a computational chemistry or materials science audience. While leveraging machine learning for benchmarking, the core contribution and primary impact lie within the domain of chemistry, potentially making it less central to the interests of a machine learning conference focused on algorithmic advancements or theoretical foundations of AI."

                "value": "This manuscript and the accompanying database should be submitted to a chemistry journal. The work here is predominantly chemistry focused, primarily quantum physical chemistry. Details of DFT calcuations, the construction of dataset, and the utility of the dataset requires peer-review from experts in quantum chemistry. To highlight this, ANI-1 and QM9 are both published in Scientific Data. PCQM4v2 is published in NeurIPS, however the work is part of a larger body of benchmarks for OGB-LSC, and the DFT datasets were curated from a peer-reviewed chemistry work by Nakata et al. (2017) in Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. \n\nThe paper provides a lot of details about how the dataset was assembled, but it is unlikely that the anonymous reviewers of this venue would be able to give proper feedback on this; it would be irresponsible to publish this work without proper peer-review. Only the final section 5.3, with Table 2, are there relevant machine learning benchmarking results on some deep models on the dataset. There is also a lot of importance placed on the size of the dataset (Figures 1, 2, 3), but it is not clear whether the additional conformations/fragmentation methods are physically sound or useful for chemical modelling.\n\nAdditional issues:\n- Table 2 should have caption before the table.\n- Figure 6 caption should be below the figure.\n- There are gramatical errors that need to be addressed: for example, line 359, \"The main subset, referred to as subset A, encompassing the most extensive conformation data, containing 20 million conformations from more than 110,000 molecules.\"\n- A double period in line 350.\n\nAdditionally there are other works, not mentioned, that have explored something similar; with conformations, higher precision calculations, property annotations etc. (also published in chemistry related venues): GEOM set by Axelrod et al. (2022), QCDGE by Zhu et al. (2024), and Nabla2DFT and NablaDFT by Khrabrov et al. (2024), VQM24 by Khan et al. (2024)."

While I am not an expert in computation chemistry, I believe this figure paints a deceptively simple measure of precision in DFT. Are the choice of level of theory and basis sets not dependent on the system being looked at; and are they appropriately chosen? Are there any dispersion corrections (as done in GEOM, and QCDGE)? Is the choice of DFT level of theory appropriate for properties that are used as targets (ie. entropy, enthalpy, heat capacity, etc.)? \n\nIs the fragmentation method deployed to generate the structures common used? There are no details given on the fragmentation algorithm used. The authors claim that this approach would give \"a diverse range of significant and complex chemical space,\" with no evidence of this.\n\nThe conformation generation through cheminformatics software like RDKit seems low-precision, given the computational cost required for DFT at B3LYP/def2-SVP. GEOM for example uses CREST, which is based on semi-empirical tight-binding model. Is RDKit sufficient? What are convergence criteria typically used for optimization process of these structures?\n\nNote that most of these questions would likely not require an explanation if reviewed by an expert in quantum computational chemistry."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weaknesses of the paper are significant misinterpretations of core chemistry concepts and a lack of clarity around the dataset\u2019s intended applications, leading to technical ambiguities and misleading claims. \n\n1. The paper does not clearly articulate the goal of developing the dataset, or potential use cases. Although the data is well-suited for potential energy surface modeling, the introduction implies applications outside of this scope (e.g., structure\u2013activity relationships), which is strongly misleading. Section 2.2 should be re-written to clarify these use cases, and clarify the unclear \u201cconformer generation\u201d task. Moreover, the paper would strongly benefit from repositioning the use cases earlier in the paper to align the introduction with actual practical applications. A number of vague statements regarding applicability should be removed. \n\n2. The discussion (and application) of quantum chemistry methodologies is severely flawed. \n  * The high-level introduction to DFT misses a number of key points: The main goal is to approximate solutions to the electronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation for obtaining energies and, possibly, estimate further molecular property labels from the computed solution. \n  * Figure 2 and the accompanying discussion makes strong statements about computation accuracy using different basis sets. However, both the Pople basis sets (6-31G(d) / 6-31G(2df,p)) and the Karlsruhe basis sets (def2-SVP) are double-zeta basis sets with additional polarization functions. To the best of my knowledge, for the molecules studied, the accuracy differences between these basis sets should be negligible. Any claims of significant accuracy differences must be rigorously supported with citations. \n  * Statements like \u201cB3LYP/def2-SVP as one of the highest precision levels achievable\u201c are strongly misleading. In fact, in computational chemistry, double-zeta basis sets are considered a rather low-level method. Established workflows, such as optimizing geometries with cheap semi-empirical methods, followed by single-point DFT for energies and gradients, are entirely overlooked in generating the dataset. \n3. The discussion of chemistry concepts contains a number of inaccuracies and misinterpretations which weaken the perceived credibility of the study. Examples (non-comprehensive selection) include:\n  * Force fields and potential energy surface are often discussed as two disjoint entities \u2013 rather than explaining that force fields are formally the derivative of the potential energy surface. \n* SMILES and InChI representations are introduced without clarity on their primary function as molecular graph notations. \n* \u201cHeavy atom is any atom other than hydrogen, typically used in molecular studies to focus on more complex atomic interactions\u201d (p. 3) This statement fails to address why distinguishing heavy atoms is relevant to real-world applications.\n* \u201cLabeled as important phosphate groups by our chemistry expert\u201d (p. 5) What is the rationale behind labeling phosphate groups (which are one specific out of many relevant functional groups)? \n* \u201cwhile the significance of other conformations is also noteworthy\u201d (p. 6) This statement is highly ambiguous. What is the relevance of further (non-minimum) conformations? \n\n4. The choice of MAE as the error metric for model evaluation overlooks an essential consideration. Since energy scales with molecular size (i.e., number of heavy atoms), the MAE will naturally increase in an out-of-domain prediction task that includes larger molecules. The (in)ability to generalize across chemical space is not reflected in this metric. \n\n5. The paper uses overly promotional language, particularly in the abstract and introduction. Examples include \u201cunprecedented innovation and efficiency\u201d, \u201cprofessional and transformative research\u201d, \u201chigh-precision [\u2026] quantum mechanical level\u201d, \u201cmeticulously computed\u201d, \u201ccomprehensive studies of structure\u2013property relationships\u201d. These sections should be thoroughly revised."

                "value": "1. The paper provides insufficient detail on the fragmentation / recombination strategy to construct the molecule library. What constitutes a fragment? How were the fragments generated and selected? \n2. Similarly, the rationales and workflows of conformation generation and selection of \u201cstable\u201d conformations should be explained in more detail (at minimum, in the Appendix). \n3. A notable portion of the paper blend descriptions of the dataset and comparisons to existing datasets, with overlapping content in section 2.2 and section 3. A clearer separation of these aspects would improve clarity and aid reader comprehension. \n4. A better distinction between *molecules* and *conformations* would be beneficial for readability of the paper, and for understanding the structure of the dataset. E.g. the analyses in Fig. 5a and Fig. 6 would be more informative on the molecule level (rather than on the conformation level). A plot of average conformation number against heavy atom count, for example, would help contextualize the dataset structure. Similarly, plots of further simple-to-compute topological molecular descriptors (molecular weight, ring counts, \u2026) would add further information. \n5. The purpose of Fig. 5b, showing energy as a function of dihedral angle without specifying the molecule(s) is unclear. From my perspective, this plot, as it stands, is elementary, and provides no insights into the dataset. \n6. An estimate of the computational resources required for dataset generation (in terms of CPU hours), would provide readers with a realistic perspective on the cost, and feasibility of expanding such datasets."
