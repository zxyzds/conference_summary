    "title": "Axis-level Reflectional Symmetry Detection with Group-Equivariant Representation",
    "abstract": "Reflectional symmetry detection remains a challenging task in machine perception, particularly in complex real-world scenarios involving noise, occlusions, and distortions. We introduce a novel equivariant approach to axis-level reflectional symmetry detection that effectively leverages dihedral group-equivariant representation to detect symmetry axes as line segments. We propose orientational anchor expansion for fine-grained rotation-equivariant analysis of diverse symmetry patterns across multiple orientations. Additionally, we develop reflectional matching with multi-scale kernels to extract effective cues of reflectional correlations, allowing for robust symmetry detection across different receptive fields. Our approach unifies axis-level detection with reflectional matching while preserving dihedral group equivariance throughout the process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method while providing more accurate axis-level predictions than existing pixel-level methods in challenging scenarios.",

It\u2019s an interesting approach (though needs to be sufficiently distinguished from others in the field). \n\nThis paper is clearly written and I can follow the logic on what they are trying to do.\n\nI appreciate the approach with fibers and it seems interesting to not use a dense approach.    I like the difference in the approach and would like to see more of that with different backbones since I think it would work even better."

They are used in the papers the authors compared with: Seo, Ahyun, Woohyeon Shim, and Minsu Cho. \"Learning to discover reflection symmetry via polar matching convolution.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision. 2021.  In addition, why have you deviated from the standard precision recall with F1 marked curve like the previously mentioned papers?  That is really useful to understand how your metric compares to others.  \n\nThis paper (which cited thoughout the paper), also uses equivariant networks for both rotation and reflection symmetry detection.   Seo 2021 and 2022 both use equivariant kernels with Seo 2022 uses rotation group equivalents.  The main difference between the group equivalence of the other papers, at least that I understand, is that the group d8 is used rather than a special Euclidean symmetry group out of the 17.  I'm only referring to the difference in the equivariant and not other differences in the approach.  \n\n\nMissing citations\nGens, R. and Domingos, P. Deep Symmetry Networks.
