    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are nowadays the benchmark approach in graph representation learning, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. While existing defense techniques primarily concentrate on the training phase of GNNs, involving adjustments to message passing architectures or pre-processing methods, there is a noticeable gap in methods focusing on increasing robustness during inference. In this context, this study introduces RobustCRF, a post-hoc approach aiming to enhance the robustness of GNNs at the inference stage. Our proposed method, founded on statistical relational learning using a Conditional Random Field, is model-agnostic and does not require prior knowledge about the underlying model architecture. We validate the efficacy of this approach across various models, leveraging benchmark node classification datasets.",

                "value": "The biggest issue with this paper is that its literature review is outdated. It does not cite any papers (except GCORN) in the field of GNN adversarial robustness published after 2023, resulting in the omission of many recent advancements in evasion attack and defense. For example:\n\n>*Missing discussion with adaptive attack.*\n\nAdversarial robustness studies the generalization in the worst-case scenario. [1] provides a detailed explanation of how existing GNN defenses are highly vulnerable to adaptive evasion attacks and propose a set of perturbed graphs as a bare minimum robustness unit test. \n\nNicholas Carlini has elaborated extensively on this topic. When designing a defense method, ensuring attack agnosticism and assuming the adversary is aware of the defense are better standards for evaluating the robustness of a method. If a method can be bypassed by a very simple trick, how can we argue that it is adversarially robust?\n\nAuthors also mentioned the hope that the method would be robust against unknown future attacks. Therefore, assuming robustness in any situation is necessary, which is why considering adaptive attacks is essential when developing defenses.\n\n>*Missing comparison with the current state-of-the-art defenses against evasion attacks, adversarial training [2, 3].*\n\nThe experimental setup of adversarial training is same as that of this paper and shares a similar motivation\u2014encouraging the model to be locally invariant so that it maintains the same output within the range of semantically preserving perturbations. Based on the experimental results presented, the robustness of CRFRobust does not show a significant advantage compared to the baselines used in the paper. Therefore, it is highly likely that adversarial training would perform much better than CRFRobust.\n\n>*The attacks used in this work are TOO weak.*\n\nThe structural attack baseline used in this work, DICE, is a heuristic attack based on homophily assumption. However, it serves as a very weak attack in this filed. The authors should consider stronger attack settings, similar to those described in [2] and [3].\n\n### References:\n\n[1] Are Defenses for Graph Neural Networks Robust?

                "value": "**1. What is the difference between defense against evasion attack and post-hoc defense.**\n\nBoth of them assume that attack happens during the inference phase, so the training procedure is not affected. If we formalize this problem mathematically, there are no differece. Therefore, all the reference work [1, 2, 3] that I mentioned in the previous review comprise the defense or evaluation on evasion attack. It is very necessary to consider them, see reasons below. [1] provide a systematical way to evaluate adaptive robustness of evasion attack; [2] is the first work that make adversarial training work on GNNs, and adversarial training is considered the only way to defense adversarial attack in the filed of vision community."

Does the &#9312;\n in your table 1 represents clean accuracy and &#9313; represents ASR?\n\nThe second question is.

Although it provides a theoretical framework of CRF for designing GNN architecture, the authors heuristically define the potential functions $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_{ab}$ without any theoretical guarantee or intuition from the CRF perspective. These two terms actually follow the robustness criteria of most existing works.\n\n2. The experimental evaluation is not comprehensive:\n   * **Baselines**: The selected baselines are insufficient. How does RobustCRF compare to RUNG [1], ElasticGNN [2], and SoftMedian [3]?\n   * **Attacks**: The main evaluation focuses on feature-based attacks, which are not effective for graph-based models. For structure-based models, the authors only compare the black-box Dice attack, which is not a commonly used attack in this field. The authors should evaluate the model under topology PGD attack, metattack, nettack, or node injection attack.\n   * **Performance**: The models show very limited improvement over other baselines, or even underperform them.\n\n[1] Robust Graph Neural Networks via Unbiased Aggregation  \n\n[2] Elastic Graph Neural Networks  \n\n[3] Robustness of Graph Neural Networks at Scale  \n\n[4] Graph Neural Networks Inspired by Classical Iterative Algorithms\n\n3. The presentation needs further improvement:\n   * **Notation**: The notation is poor and very confusing. The input notation should be consistent. In the paper, $[A,X]$, $[G,X]$, and $\\mathcal{G} \\times \\mathcal{X}$ appear to represent the same thing.\n   * **Clarity**: What do $\\tilde{G}$, $\\tilde{X}$, and $\\tilde{Y}$ mean? Sometimes they denote the perturbed input, other times updated predictions, and occasionally they are used to differentiate two inputs. This makes it difficult for readers to follow the paper.\n   * **Redundant Information**: Sections 4.1 and 4.2 seem redundant. This information is commonly known in the robustness of GNNs but occupies two subsections.\n   * **Table Placement**: Tables are not positioned properly. For example, Tables 1 and 4 should be near the main experiment, and Table 2 (ablation study) should not be placed between the main result tables (Tables 1 and 4).\n\n4. The paper lacks ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RobustCRF. For example, the authors should include an ablation study to assess the impact of $\\alpha$ in the potential functions, the number of iterations, etc."
