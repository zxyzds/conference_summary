    "title": "Predicting the Energy Landscape of Stochastic Dynamical System via  Physics-informed Self-supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Energy landscapes play a crucial role in shaping dynamics of many real-world complex systems. System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a landscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced diffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles. Estimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding interdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the difficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to infer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to learn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It first maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape space by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the graph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy estimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across interdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a correlation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution prediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\\%.

                "value": "This paper proposes to infer the energy landscape of complex, stochastic dynamical systems. A distinguishing feature is the adoption of vector quantization techniques for dimension reduction. Dynamical information was inferred via a graph neural Fokker-Planck equation method. A regularization term was introduced to constrain the long-term prediction behavior between the empirical distribution p and the Boltzmann distribution. The novelty of bringing together these ideas is appreciated. Experiments were performed on 3 tests: 2d Prinz potential, ecological evolution, and fast-folding peptides. The method part of the paper is not very clear and somewhat difficult to follow. There is no ablation tests, so it's hard to see what the various loss terms or model designs offer. There is no discussion of the limitations of the method."

The reason is that many factors may be composed that give rise to stable solutions. Hence a multivariate representation of the discrete identities must be constructed (think about language, which is discrete but allows generating a huge number of legal combinations of words).\n\n(2) It is not clear to me that g in general will preserve all information about the energy of the state, so it may be necessary for the encoder (from observations to states) to look at the whole past trajectory in order to make a probabilistic guess about the state proxy.\n\n(3) the main model (sec 3.2) is not sufficiently understandable and could use more motivation for its different parts. Why these equations in particular (4 and 5).\n\n(4) The experimental setup seems to lack comparisons with *published results* from earlier work, which makes it difficult to know if the comparisons are fair.\n\n(5) The test set includes only trajectories from the same system for which a training trajectory is given, i.e., there is no form of generalization to new systems (e.g., new molecules)."
