    "title": "Understanding Scale Shift in Domain Generalization for Crowd Localization",
    "abstract": "Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to various downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from significant performance degradation due to differences in head scale distributions (scale shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models.\nTo this end, we address three key questions: (i) how to quantify the scale shift influence on DG task, (ii) why does this influence occur, (iii) how to mitigate the influence.\nSpecifically, we first establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms, to quantify the influence. \nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms and highlight the under-explored nature of this issue.\nTo further understand its behind reason, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift. \nBuilding on this analysis, we further propose a simple yet effective algorithm called Semantic Hook to mitigate the influence of scale shift on DG, which also serves as a case study revealing three significant insights for future research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable research direction, which we term $\\textit{Scale Shift Domain Generalization}$.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The rationality of ScaleBench is questionable. First, while the perspective effect often occurs in crowd localization, there exist images that are captured from different angles (e.g., top view). In such scenarios, image distribution regularization may fail to partition the images correctly. Second, in the real world, scale shift is often coupled with other factors, such as occlusion, weather, and appearance. For example, when the object suffers from significant appearance variations, the counting model may fail to localize objects even if training and testing data yield the same scale distribution. Third, dividing images into patches will inevitably result in incomplete objects, which could affect the localization results. Therefore, evaluations on ScaleBench may not rigorously reflect the influence of scale shift. \n2. The proposed SemanticHook does not exhibit superiority over existing methods. As shown in Table 1, the simplest baseline ERM already achieves good results. The proposed method is not necessarily better than ERM.\n3. Following the previous comment, the rationale of SemanticHook is not entirely convincing. Eq. 6 suggests that p(s, c, \u2026) can lead to a spurious association between the output y and scale c. This term is a joint distribution of semantic s and scale c. However, the authors merely try to enhance the semantic association between semantic s and output y. Experimental results demonstrate that such a technique does not address scale shift effectively. Additionally, perturbing image is not a new idea, which is widely used in adversarial attack.\n4. It appears that the influence of image interpolation is not rigorously quantified in Table 4. First, the implementation of Random Augmentation shall be modified according to different domains, i.e., the range of random scaling should be customized based on domain Tiny, Small, and Normal. Second, it is necessary to train the model using different source domains to identify the effect of image interpolation. The results on domain Big are insufficient to conclude that the benefits of image interpolation are modest.\n5. Regarding training details. In practice, random scaling is commonly used to alleviate scale variations. As the authors use this technique to train the model, the reported results may not correctly reveal the effect of scale shift, because random scaling already simulates different scales.\n6. The paper lacks evaluations on previous methods featuring multi-scale architecture, e.g., STEER. Evaluations on these methods are helpful in revealing whether previous methods can handle scale variations."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) The paper frames the issue of scale shift as a new challenge within domain generalization for crowd localization, but this framing seems overstated. Scale shift, where different head sizes (scales) impact model performance across datasets, is not fundamentally new. Previous works have already explored the impact of scale variation on domain adaptation in crowd analysis (albeit under different terminologies), suggesting that this issue is more a subset of a well-studied generalization problem rather than a novel concept. Claiming it as the \"first study\" on \"scale shift domain generalization\" could be seen as an attempt to rebrand existing challenges without sufficient justification.\n\n2) The proposed \"Semantic Hook\" technique to mitigate scale shift claims to enhance the association between semantic features and task predictions, but its practical effectiveness remains questionable. This method involves adding Gaussian noise to \"hook\" relevant features, yet the theoretical rationale behind this approach is underdeveloped. How \"Semantic Hook\" contributes to decoupling scale-related biases from semantic content is unclear. Additionally, the improvement in F1 scores presented in Table 2 is marginal, suggesting that the Semantic Hook might not be a robust solution.\n\n3) While the paper provides a comparison of 20 domain generalization algorithms, there is little discussion about the practical differences in their robustness against scale shifts. The Semantic Hook\u2019s performance is only marginally better than ERM, raising doubts about its practical value. Furthermore, the experiments rely heavily on F1 scores across ScaleBench domains but do not include additional evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall) that could provide a fuller picture of model performance under scale shift.\n\n4) ScaleBench, with its scale-based domain partitions, may not accurately reflect real-world applications where scale distributions are more complex and continuous rather than discretely defined. The Leave-One-Out approach used for evaluation also artificially simplifies the generalization challenge. Real-world scenarios often involve more nuanced and diverse shifts between training and deployment environments, suggesting that the paper\u2019s evaluation may lack external validity."
