    "abstract": "It is common practice to combine deep neural networks to ensembles. These deep ensembles can profit from the cancellation of errors effect: Errors by ensemble members may average out and the ensemble achieves better generalization performance than each individual network.  Bayesian neural networks learn a posterior distribution over  model parameters, and sampling and weighting networks according to this posterior yields an ensemble model referred to as Bayes ensemble. In this study, we stress that neither the sampling nor the weighting in a Bayes ensemble are particularly well-suited for increasing generalization performance, as they do not support the cancellation of errors effect, which is evident in the limit from the Bernstein-von~Mises theorem for misspecified models. In contrast, a weighted average of models, where the weights are optimized by minimizing a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, can improve generalization performance. This requires that the optimization takes correlations between models into account, which can be achieved by minimizing the tandem loss at the cost that hold-out data for estimating error correlations need to be available. The PAC-Bayesian weighting increases the robustness against correlated models and models with lower performance in an ensemble. This allows us to safely add several models from the same learning process to an ensemble, instead of using early-stopping for selecting a single weight configuration. Our study presents empirical results supporting these conceptual considerations on four different classification datasets. We show that state-of-the-art Bayes ensembles from the literature, despite being computationally demanding, do not improve over simple uniformly weighted deep ensembles and cannot match the performance of deep ensembles weighted by optimizing the tandem loss, which additionally come with non-vacuous generalization guarantees.",

The authors contend that Bayesian ensembles, which typically average models based on posterior distributions, are suboptimal for maximizing generalization performance due to limitations in supporting the \"cancellation of errors\" effect. This issue arises because Bayesian ensemble members tend to converge to similar predictions rather than compensating for each other's errors. Instead, the authors propose a PAC-Bayesian approach that optimizes ensemble weights by minimizing a tandem loss over the validation set. This method accounts for model correlations and aims to increase robustness by improving generalization, even when ensemble members are generated from similar training processes. The empirical results on several benchmark datasets show that PAC-Bayesian ensembles with optimized weighting  using the validation set outperform Bayesian ensembles."

In contrast to [1] which also investigates PAC-Bayesian bounds for posterior predictive weighting, the authors stress the use of second order PAC-Bayesian analysis. The authors also discuss why deep ensembles often outperform single mode Bayesian Neural Networks (referred to as Bayes ensembles in the paper), and motivate PAC-Bayesian bounds from this.

As far as I am aware, the concept of reweighing ensemble members post model training is not new. If I have understood the proposed method correctly, then this is what is commonly referred to as _stacking_ in ensembles. See e.g. [1]. \n    2. \"We discuss the conceptual differences... \". The discussion on why deep ensembles outperform single mode bayesian neural networks (referred to as Bayes ensembles) is commonly known, understood and researched within the Bayesian neural network community. See e.g. [2]. This also relates to the third listed main contribution which has previously been shown and is widely understood.\n* In my opinion some key metrics are lacking. Currently the authors only report accuracy, but I think negative log-likelihood or calibration metrics (ECE) are equally important and of interest to the Bayesian community. Currently there are no metrics showcasing uncertainty quantification of the proposed methods which is of high interest in these types of works. Could the authors possible include some of these metrics?\n* Could the authors discuss why they write \"As outlined above, general ensemble methods and Bayesian neural networks have different motivations\" in line 195-196? In my opinion they are motivated for the same reason: improved generalisation, robustness and uncertainty quantification. One simply is multimodal (ensembles) whilst the other (typically) only covers a single mode (BNNs).\n* I strongly disagree with the sentence in lines 480-481 \"Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is not meant to maximize predictive performance but to get a better idea about the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of a single model.\". To me, the exact point of BMA is to improve model uncertainty quantification and predictive performance. Could the authors elaborate on this?\n\nMinor comments/questions:\n1. In line 133 the authors write \"It is in general difficult to sample from $p(w|D)$, which can .. \", but I suspect the authors meant to say that it is difficult to approximate $p(w|D)$?\n2. The setup in the results section is a little bit confusing to me when reading the paper. I would suggest that the authors perhaps first present experimental setup, and then discuss results (but this is an opinion).\n3. The naming convention of \"Bayes ensembles\" is confusing to me. I have not seen this terminology before and to me it indicates an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks. Are the authors in fact just referring to Bayesian neural networks?\n\n[1]: Stacking for Non-mixing Bayesian Computations: The Curse and Blessing of Multimodal Posteriors, Yao et. al, 2018.\n\n[2]: Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization, Wilson and Izmailov, 2020."

The main conclusion of this work is that the Bayesian Ensemble is no better than the simple deep ensemble approach. However, simple, uniform deep ensembles are already the conventional approach. Thus the contributions in this conclusion are pretty limited. As for the PAC-Bayesian ensemble, from the experimental results, it appears that the differences are very marginal.

From the definition in L117, $\\mathrm{AVG}_u$ takes the uniform average, which is the vanilla approach of deep ensembles.\n    - In Figure 1: Why are the uniform deep ensembles (DE) horizontal lines in Figure 2?
