    "abstract": "Protein diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for protein design. One such pioneering model is Genie, a method that asymmetrically represents protein structures during the forward and backward processes, using simple Gaussian noising for the former and expressive SE(3)-equivariant attention for the latter. In this work we introduce Genie 2, extending Genie to capture a larger and more diverse protein structure space through architectural innovations and massive data augmentation. Genie 2 adds motif scaffolding capabilities via a novel multi-motif framework that designs co-occurring motifs with unspecified inter-motif positions and orientations. This makes possible complex protein designs that engage multiple interaction partners and perform multiple functions. On both unconditional and conditional generation, Genie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all known methods on key design metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty. Genie 2 also solves more motif scaffolding problems than other methods and does so with more unique and varied solutions. Taken together, these advances set a new standard for structure-based protein design.",

While they claim that Genie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms all known methods on key design metrics, Figure 3 Panel B shows that Genie 2 performs significantly worse than Proteus on long proteins.\n\n2. The comparison benchmarking is insufficient. \n\n    a. Unconditional generation: The comparison lacks the inclusion of recent methods such as MultiFlow [1], CarbonNovo [2], and FoldFlow2 [3], which have demonstrated significant performance improvements. \n\n    b. Single-Motif Scaffolding: Methods like Chroma and FoldFlow2 should be included for comparison. While Chroma is included in the benchmarking for unconditional generation, it is excluded in the scaffolding generation comparisons. Clarification on this omission is needed.\n3. The methodological contributions appear incremental. The authors extend Genie's architecture and training procedure to enable motif scaffolding, with most modifications focusing on adapting input features. Additionally, Genie 2 incorporates triangular multiplicative updates, which have already been shown to be effective in previous works such as Proteus [4], CarbonNovo [2], and FoldFlow2 [3].\n4. Insufficient Analysis of Multi-Motif Scaffolding: Despite claiming multi-motif scaffolding as a key contribution, the paper provides limited analysis in this area. Interesting analysis would be :\n\n    a. In failed cases, is the failure due to incorrect single motif design or inaccuracies in the relative positioning of motifs?\n\n    b. Does the success rate of scaffolding depend on the number of motifs being used?\n\n 5.  The method requires significantly more inference steps than previous methods, indicating low sampling efficiency.\n\n\n[1] Campbell et al. \u201cGenerative Flows on Discrete State-Spaces: Enabling Multimodal Flows with Applications to Protein Co-Design\u201d.

                "value": "1. Previous methods tend to generate more alpha-helices than beta-strands. In Genie 2, what is the distribution of generated proteins among the structural classes of all-alpha, all-beta, alpha+beta, and alpha/beta? Does the designability of the generated proteins depend on the ratio of alpha-helices?\n\n2. Why was a batch size of 256 chosen for training Genie 2? Both Proteus and Chroma use batch sizes larger than 500, yet they exhibit significantly different performance levels. Therefore, without additional experimental results, it is unclear whether batch size is the main reason for Genie 2's significantly worse performance compared to Proteus on long proteins. \n\n2.

                "value": "The authors highlight functional protein design as a motivation for this work, and assert that functional protein design tasks can often be reduced to scaffolding of known motifs. While this may be true for simple enzymes, many functional proteins of therapeutic and industrial interest are considerably more complex (e.g., involving conformational changes or inter-domain coordination). Without experimental validation of the results presented here, it is difficult to know whether the proposed method would meaningfully improve functional design outcomes.\n\nGiven the relationship between this work and the original Genie paper, it is surprising to not see any direct comparisons between Genie 2 and the original model. For instance, how would the original Genie architecture trained on the PDB compare with the results presented in Table 1? It seems that the largest improvements came from expanding the training dataset to include AFDB, but it would be useful to see more detailed ablations of the architectural, data, and training objective changes, and the interplay between these (if there exists any).\n\nThe analysis of low-temperature sampling is quite hard to follow as currently presented. It is not clear that the authors have used low-temperature sampling for the results presented in Table 1 until the following section analyzing secondary structure distributions. Further, in this section (line 323), the authors cite a finding that low-temperature sampling yielded better results, but do not provide the results of this analysis.\n\nThe result about \u201cdesignability\u201d of AFDB structures is interesting, but not very convincing in its current form. Rather than summarizing the results of changing from scRMSD to scTM, the authors should present the full distribution of values for both of these metrics. The authors note that ProteinMPNN may be biased towards the PDB; this hypothesis could be tested by using ESM-IF1, which has been trained on AlphaFold2-predicted structures.\n\nMuch of the evaluation presented in this paper depends on ESMFold as an oracle for structure prediction. While this has become a standard practice, as noted by the authors, it would be useful for readers to include some discussion of the shortcomings and potential biases introduced by this approach."

How were these checkpoints selected?\n\nIt seems that the Chroma conditioner framework should admit single- and multi-motif scaffolding as described in this paper. Was there a reason this model was not benchmarked in these scenarios?\n\nHow important is the sequence information for motif conditioning? In the absence of this information, would the model still produce viable solutions to the motif scaffolding problems?"

They also extend the single-motif problem to multi-motif generation, exploring whether the model can generate proteins with independent functions, pushing the boundaries of creating more complex and versatile protein machines.

However, it remains unclear whether this improvement is due to training with AFDB or low-temperature sampling (see Q3).\n- Training on AFDB is a logical approach that has already been applied in other protein design models (e.g., Bilingual Language Model for Protein Sequence and Structure, Michael Heinzinger et al., bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.23.550085).\n- Encoding protein structure as SE3-invariant node and pair features is also an established approach (e.g., AlphaFold 2 encodes template information as node and pair). Although this work shows that SE3 invariance is effective for motifs encoding, it does not demonstrate broader impact on this design choice."

                "value": "1. Table 3: The authors demonstrate the effect of conditional training ratio on small-scale, \u201cunconverged\u201d models. While this limitation is understandable due to time constraints, the conclusion that conditional training universally enhances performance remains speculative. More comprehensive results during the rebuttal period would strengthen the findings.\n2. Low-temperature sampling (line 323): The authors state that \u201clow temperature sampling yields better results.\u201d Could they specify which metric(s) this \u201cbetter\u201d refers to, as it\u2019s unclear from the context?\n3. Temperature sensitivity: The authors used different temperatures (\u03b3) for unconditional generation and motif-scaffolding, highlighting the importance of tuning this parameter. Could they include the default temperatures used for each model in the main text and clarify the impact of varying temperatures on each task? Does this adjustment impose trade-offs, and how sensitive is the model to this factor?\n4. Training data balance: Is it reasonable to balance experimental structure data (PDB) and synthetic data (AFDB) for training? Are the results significantly biased towards synthetic data?\n5. Secondary structure distribution (section 4.2): When evaluating secondary structure distribution, comparing to AFDB might be problematic as 1) not all baselines were trained on AFDB, and 2) AFDB may differ in structural distribution from real-world PDB data.\n6. Secondary structure distribution (section 4.2): Contrary to the authors' suggestion in line 318, it seems Chroma, Proteus, and RFDiffusion appear to generate more beta strands (top left) than AFDB. Could the authors clarify their statement about underrepresented beta strands and loop elements?\n7. Low-temperature sampling for AFDB (line 352): The lower designability in AFDB might explain low designability at normal temperatures for Genie 2, but it doesn\u2019t directly explain why low-temperature sampling would mitigate this. Could the authors provide additional insights?\n8. Baseline model: The authors mention the Twisted Diffusion Sampler in related work but do not include it as a baseline. Could they clarify this choice?\n9. Baseline model Genie 1: Could the authors include baseline performance results for Genie 1 in unconditional generation?\n10. Multi-motif scaffolding benchmark curation: This benchmark includes only proteins with <200 amino acids. Have the authors explored more complex cases with longer sequences, or are there specific challenges in curating such datasets?\n11. Multi-chain generation: Although Genie 2 accepts \u201cchain index\u201d as an input feature, it does not support multi-chain generation with motif-scaffolding. What limits this implementation?\n12. Clarifications on some claims:\n    - The authors claim Genie 2 \u201cbetter captures protein structure space\u201d and covers a \u201clarger and more diverse protein structure space.\u201d However, this aspect has not been directly evaluated. Current results only show higher diversity, not necessarily \u201cbroader structure space coverage\u201d compared to Genie 1, especially given the smaller sample size examined (1,035 structures, line 309).\n    - In Equation (5), the authors claim that \u201cmotifs are enforced as a soft constraint, ensuring responsiveness to motif specifications while designing the protein as a whole.\u201d However, the current loss does not distinguish explicitly between motifs and scaffolds (e.g., no separate regularization for motif losses). The authors might want to suggest the benefits of jointly learning the motif and scaffolds coordinates and further clarification could strengthen the interpretation."
