    "title": "Beyond Canonicalization: How Tensorial Messages Improve Equivariant Message Passing",
    "abstract": "In numerous applications of geometric deep learning, the studied systems exhibit spatial symmetries and it is desirable to enforce these. For the symmetry of global rotations and reflections, this means that the model should be equivariant with respect to the transformations that form the group of $\\mathrm O(d)$.\nWhile many approaches for equivariant message passing require specialized architectures, including non-standard normalization layers or non-linearities, we here present a framework based on local reference frames (\"local canonicalization\") which can be integrated with any architecture without restrictions.\nWe enhance equivariant message passing based on local canonicalization by introducing tensorial messages to communicate geometric information consistently between different local coordinate frames.\nOur framework applies to message passing on geometric data in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension.\nWe explicitly show how our approach can be adapted to make a popular existing point cloud architecture equivariant. We demonstrate the superiority of tensorial messages and achieve state-of-the-art results on normal vector regression and competitive results on other standard 3D point cloud tasks.",

                "value": "This paper focuses on the equivariant message passing and proposes a formalism which together with local canonicalization enables consistent communication of geometric features between different nodes.

However, estimating accurate normals is difficult for *real-world* point clouds due to severe noise. So I expect to see results on real-world tasks rather than only synthetic datasets.\n2. An important application of invariance and equivariance is point cloud registration. I expect to see the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world point cloud registration tasks, such as 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch.\n3. In Tab.3, the tensor messages surprisingly outperforms the model with scalar messages under random local frames. The random local frames affect the performance of the model in the form of noise, but these noises help tensor messages perform better. I am very curious about its reason.\n4. In Tab.2, I notice refining frames brings marginal improvements, which may indicate that this step fails to obtain better normals. For comparison, I expect to see the results with (1) PCA-based normals and (2) ground-truth normals."

                "value": "This work proposes an extension of unconstrained message-passing architectures that makes them equivariant by canonicalizing the messages received by each node to its local frame.  It enables local canonicalization of arbitrary types of tensorial messages, which extends previous works that restrict the allowed tensor type of messages (e.g. only allowing for scalars or vectors).  In addition to the local canonicalization methodology, the authors introduce a mechanism for learning the local frame of each node, which is then refined in the later layers of the network.  In the experimental section, the authors evaluate their proposed method on various rotational equivariant point-cloud tasks and provide ablation studies that showcase how the individual parts of the proposed framework affect its performance and generalization."

However, the reviewer believes that the main advantage of the local geometric features preserving throughout the network is to deal with some non-rigid, multi-body, or deformable objects. Indeed there is no strict equivariance in deformation but it is where the local feature should make a difference. Just as shown in Fig.1 in the paper, the geometric feature should help recognize the pattern of the sub-part when it deforms or move. However, the main experiment is conducted on the modelnet rigid object, which we know the performance is quite saturated, and the reviewer believes that a robust global PCA plus any modern large point network will outperform an equivariant network in such an easy setting.\n- Again, the comparison does not capture the full equivariant network baselines. We know that there are many more equivariant point networks compared on the same benchmark but they are not included in the table.\n- Some more clear discussion of the difference between the proposed message passing with previous ones like TFN or VNN should be highlighted in the paper."
