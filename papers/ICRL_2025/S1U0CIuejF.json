    "title": "TrendDiff: Decoupling Intrinsic and Measurement Trends for Enhanced Time Series Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "Time trends can be classified into intrinsic (real) and measurement (false) trends. There has long been a critical need for techniques to discern them, especially in investment decision-making. In causal discovery, these measurement trends, essentially measurement errors, can significantly impact the performance of algorithms, making it crucial to identify and eliminate them before analysis as well. Recognizing this need, we present a novel algorithm, termed Trend Differentiator (TrendDiff). It is capable of detecting all trend-influenced variables and differentiating between those affected by measurement trends and those displaying intrinsic trends, relying on changing causal module detection and trend-influenced variables\u2019 structural properties, respectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.",

                "value": "1. Without an explicit statement in the paper, this algorithm appears to be an extension of CD-NOD. The main paper describes phase 1 (Algorithm 1) in detail; however, I believe Algorithm 1 and Theorem 1 have already been introduced in Huang et al., 2020. The citation in phase 1 gave the impression that only step 4 in Algorithm 1 and the complete proof are originally presented in Huang et al., 2020. However, after reviewing the previous work by Huang et al., 2020, it seems the entire Algorithm 1 is from that paper. Therefore, I think the citation in this section is problematic.\n\n2. There is no theorem guaranteeing phase 2, whereas Theorem 1 in phase 1 has been proved in previous work.\n\n3. Considering that measurement trends are a type of measurement error, could the models introduced in the related work aimed at causal discovery in the presence of measurement errors be used as baselines? I understand that there are no previous methods capable of identifying time trend variables, but for the causal discovery part, these models could at least be treated as baselines in Fig. 6 (b). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for estimating the correct causal graph is difficult to evaluate without any baselines.\n\n4. Algorithm 1 and Theorem 1 are demonstrated in a setting that assumes there are no measurement errors, correct? If there are errors in the dataset, how can it be guaranteed that the results from Algorithm 1 are correct, given that phase 2 heavily relies on the correctness of Algorithm 1?"

                "value": "1. Are there any experimental results on the performance of identifying measurement-trend variables, similar to Fig. 6 (a)?\n\n2. In Algorithm 2, measurement-trend variables are collected from the time-trend variables identified in Algorithm 1 after removing the identified intrinsic-trend variables. However, since intrinsic-trend variables are partly identified from the measurement, the remaining set of time-trend variables is not necessarily composed solely of measurement-trend variables, correct?\n\n3. The same question as in Questions Item 2 applies to Figure 6 (b). If the 'measurement-trend' variables are a mixture of measurement- and intrinsic-trend variables, how can it be ensured that the experiments were conducted both before and after the elimination of 'detected measurement trends'?\n\n4. Please direct me to the relevant part if I missed it\u2014could you explain how the measurement trends are removed in the experiment?\n\n5. Is there a reason for choosing the PC algorithm, which is designed for IID samples, after removing the measurement trends, instead of applying Algorithm 1 or other algorithms designed for time series datasets? If applying Algorithm 1 to the data after the elimination of detected measurement trends results in higher accuracy, does this imply that the existence of measurement trends indeed affect the correctness of Phase 1 and, consequently, the entire proposed algorithm (please refer to Weaknesses Item 4)? This seems to suggest a cyclic conflict."

The authors validate TrendDiff through simulations and a real-world environmental health dataset, showing that removing measurement trends improves causal discovery accuracy.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The current model assumes that all causal relationships are instantaneous, an oversimplification for domains requiring lagged causality (e.g., health impacts of pollution). To broaden its relevance, the algorithm could integrate methods for time-lagged effects allowing it to account for delayed causation in complex time-series data.\n- A crucial element of the TrendDiff algorithm is Algorithm 2, which represents the main novelty of this paper. However, this algorithm is placed in the appendix rather than the main text, obscuring its importance. Upon closer examination, it appears that Algorithm 2, along with other components, primarily serves as a data preprocessing step rather than a standalone causal discovery technique. This distinction is not clearly stated in the paper, which may lead to confusion about the intended scope and purpose of the method. Meanwhile, Algorithm 1, which is nearly identical to the CD-NOD algorithm, could be moved to the appendix, as it offers limited novel contribution and primarily replicates an established process for detecting time-influenced variables. Additionally, a key part of this preprocessing involves the Savitzky-Golay filter to detrend measurement-influenced variables and reduce noise. However, the filter\u2019s role, configuration, and the rationale for its selection are not discussed in the main paper, leaving a gap in transparency regarding this essential step. A clear justification for using the Savitzky-Golay filter, including details on parameterization and potential alternatives, would improve understanding of the algorithm\u2019s robustness and clarify its intended application as a preprocessing technique.\n- The paper does not provide a complete description of how the final causal graph is constructed, leaving out important details on whether additional steps were applied beyond the initial graph derived in Phase 1. While the initial causal graph is generated through conditional independence tests and orientation based on dependency relationships, it is unclear if this graph is directly used as the final causal graph or if further refinement steps were applied. The absence of a full algorithm or detailed methodology for finalizing the causal graph limits the reproducibility and clarity of the approach. Including this information would clarify whether the initial skeleton suffices or if other techniques (such as additional orientation rules or refinement methods) are necessary to achieve the final, fully directed causal graph.\n- The proposed TrendDiff algorithm is based on CD-NOD, which theoretically identifies time-influenced variables as trends. However, an examination of the CD-NOD GitHub repository and example datasets (https://github.com/Biwei-Huang/Causal-Discovery-from-Nonstationary-Heterogeneous-Data/tree/master) indicates that the synthetic data relies on sinusoidal functions to represent time dependencies. Sinusoidal patterns more accurately model seasonality rather than long-term trends, introducing ambiguity in Phase 1 of TrendDiff. This means that Phase 1 of the algorithm may be detecting seasonality along with trends, which undermines the core objective of differentiating intrinsic trends from measurement errors. Without a clear separation between seasonality and true trends, the validity of the paper's approach is in question, as the methodology may not be isolating trends as intended. A more refined approach to differentiate between seasonality and trends would strengthen the algorithm\u2019s theoretical foundation and improve its practical applicability.\n- In Section 5.1, the authors state that \"all trends were modeled as sinusoidal functions with periods w chosen randomly from a uniform distribution Unif([5, 25])\". However, this approach models seasonality rather than a true trend, as sinusoidal functions are inherently cyclical and represent recurring patterns over time. True trends, in contrast, are typically non-repeating, directional changes that occur over a longer timeframe. By modeling trends with sinusoidal functions, the paper conflates seasonality with trend, which may lead to inaccuracies in trend differentiation and limit the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness in real-world applications, where identifying genuine trends\u2014rather than cyclic seasonal effects\u2014is crucial.\n- Phase 1 of TrendDiff relies on CD-NOD to generate the initial causal graph, using a surrogate variable to represent time. However, CD-NOD\u2019s approach is nearly identical to the PC algorithm and does not account for time lags in causal relationships. Given that the proposed approach uses the causal skeleton and time-influenced variables as foundational components, employing algorithms like JPCMCI+ (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/gunther23a/gunther23a.pdf) and CDANS (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v219/ferdous23a/ferdous23a.pdf) would likely produce a more accurate causal skeleton with time lag considerations. Additionally, these algorithms are more efficient in handling high-dimensional data, which would improve the scalability and robustness of the method.\n- The experimental section lacks a comprehensive evaluation of TrendDiff's performance relative to similar algorithms, such as JPCMCI+ and CDANS, both of which incorporate the time index as a surrogate variable and are better suited for time-series data. Benchmarking TrendDiff against these methods would provide a more robust assessment of its efficiency and accuracy, offering insights into its relative strengths and weaknesses. While the paper focuses solely on TrendDiff, the real data analysis only presents results from PCMCI+ with TrendDiff, without evaluating the effectiveness of TrendDiff or comparing it with other methods. Given that TrendDiff primarily functions as a data preprocessing step rather than a standalone causal discovery approach, a comparative study using different causal discovery methods on synthetic datasets, both before and after applying TrendDiff, would yield more meaningful insights. Such an evaluation would clarify the preprocessing step's impact on causal discovery accuracy and enhance understanding of its role in improving downstream analyses. Additionally, Figure 6(b), titled \"Performance of PC algorithm using data pre- and post-elimination of detected measurement trends,\" compares the PC algorithm's performance before and after removing measurement trends. However, the PC algorithm is not suitable for time-series data as it assumes an i.i.d. structure and does not consider temporal lags, which prevents it from capturing the dependencies and causal lags inherent in time-series data. This limitation raises concerns about the validity of using the PC algorithm in this evaluation, as the lack of time-series-specific adaptations undermines the reliability of the results presented in Figure 6(b) and calls into question the overall evaluation method's accuracy in a time-dependent context."

                "value": "- Have you considered the possibility of variables being influenced by both intrinsic and measurement trends simultaneously?

Including parameterization details and comparing this filter with other detrending methods would provide more insight into this choice and its impact on causal discovery.\n- The construction of the final causal graph remains unclear. Was the initial causal graph sufficient, or did you apply additional refinement steps? A more comprehensive outline would improve the transparency of the final graph construction process.\n- Despite the limitations of CD-NOD, why was it selected for Phase 1 instead of alternatives like JPCMCI+ or CDANs? Could you explain any advantages or the rationale behind this choice?\n- Since CD-NOD uses sinusoidal functions, which represent seasonality rather than true trends, could Phase 1 of TrendDiff be misidentifying seasonality as trends? \n- Why were sinusoidal functions chosen for trends in synthetic data, given their alignment with cyclical rather than directional changes? Clearly distinguishing seasonality from true trends could improve the approach\u2019s validity, particularly in contexts with prevalent seasonal patterns.\n- Why did you choose the PC algorithm to compare performance before and after eliminating measurement trends, given that PC is not designed for time-series data and cannot account for temporal dependencies? - Wouldn\u2019t it have been more suitable to use CD-NOD, which was already employed in Algorithm 1 and is better suited for time-series causal discovery?"

Nonstationarity means the causal mechanism $f_i$ that generates $X_i$ from its parent $PA_i$ changes with time. For trend, such a change should has a direction (increasing or decreasing) with time, see Def. 1 of (White and Granger, 2011) in your reference. However, Def. 1 in the paper fails to signify this.\n\nIn a similar way, measurement trend should not be confused with meansurement error along time. According to Def. 3 in the paper, a white noise along time or a Brownian motion can be considered as measurement trend, however, there is no tendency in them.\n\n**2**. The novelty of the proposed techniques is limited. The use of a time indexing variable $C$ to identify nonstationary variables is a classic approach established by CD-NOD (Huang et al., 2020). I believe that trend warrants special attention, particularly regarding their properties of increasing or decreasing over time, rather than trivially applying results from nonstationary causal discovery."

More importantly, it is then argued that if a trended variable is affected by either an intrinsic or measurement trend, then the type can be distinguished, based on appropriate conditional independence statements related to the underlying causal structure. The paper concludes with a variety of experiments over simulated and real data, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can differentiate between the two types of trends.
