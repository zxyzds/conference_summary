    "title": "MVFL: Multivariate Vertical Federated Learning for Time-Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Extending multivariate time series forecasting to resource-limited devices is a critical demand for real applications, especially with the advancements in IoT technologies. A common scenario is where the variates are distributed vertically on different devices and each device needs to do local forecasting. This paper studies a resource-efficient solution for this scenario based on vertical federated learning (VFL). Prior VFL frameworks are designed for situations where only one party holds the labels and would struggle to meet the demand of the targeted scenario, as storage resources usage would increase dramatically with the number of devices. Going beyond VFL, we design multivariate vertical federated learning (MVFL) as a novel federated learning framework, where we separate communication features and local features in an embedded feature space. This design enables MVFL to utilize storage and communication resources more efficiently by eliminating the redundant models. MVFL outperforms VFL approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. On four real-world benchmarks, compared to VFL, when the storage resources are equally utilized, MVFL yields a 14\\% relative improvement on loss with a 43\\% relative improvement on communication resources usage. Even when both MVFL and VFL employ the same main model size, MVFL achieves a 75\\% reduction in storage resources compared to VFL, albeit with a slight compromise in terms of loss.",

The time-series forecasting proposed in this article is not a classification task, so is it a reasonable scenario for each client to hold the features of one dimension in a multi-dimensional time-series? Will there be such an application in reality? In addition to the weather dataset, will other common time-series forecasting datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and ILI also exhibit such a scenario? It seems to be a synthetic scenario. \n\n2. How can privacy issues of communication features be preserved?\n\n3. The adopted model is unclear. What about the trendy transformer-based model or other time series forecasting models, like PatchTST, TimesNet, FEDformer, Informer or others?\n\n4. The comparisons in experiments are insufficient. The proposed methods are only compared with VFL. It can be compared with other FL for time-series forecasting like MetePFL[1] or VFL work (changing the downstream task). Only one baseline cannot validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Chen, Shengchao, et al. \"Prompt federated learning for weather forecasting: toward foundation models on meteorological data.\" in IJCAI 2023."

This work aims to address the challenges of multivariate time series forecasting; however, the datasets used do not adequately demonstrate its effectiveness in this regard. The largest dataset they used, Weather, includes only 21 variables, whereas real-world time series data often involves far more complex variables, as seen in datasets such as Traffic (862 variables), ECL (321 variables), and PEMS07 (883 variables).\n\nAdditionally, have the authors considered evaluation metrics other than MSE and MAE? The R-squared (the coefficient of determination) is a quite commonly used evaluation metric in time-series forecasting. While MSE is valuable for understanding prediction errors, R-squared provides a broader view of how well the model captures the underlying relationships in the data."
