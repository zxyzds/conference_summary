    "title": "Topological Zigzag Spaghetti for Diffusion-based Generation and Prediction on Graphs",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently emerged as a new powerful machinery for generative artificial intelligence on graphs, with applications ranging from drug design to knowledge discovery. However, despite their high potential, most, if not all, currently existing graph diffusion models are limited in their ability to holistically describe the intrinsic {\\it higher-order} topological graph properties, which obstructs model generalizability and adoption for downstream tasks. We propose to address this fundamental challenge and extract the latent salient topological graph descriptors at different resolutions by leveraging zigzag persistence. We develop a new computationally efficient topological summary, zigzag spaghetti (ZS), which delivers the most inherent topological properties {\\it simultaneously over a sequence of graphs at multiple resolutions}. We derive theoretical stability guarantees of ZS and present the first attempt to integrate\ndynamic topological information into graph diffusion models. Our extensive experiments on %9 benchmark datasets for \ngraph classification and prediction tasks suggest that ZS has a high promise not only to enhance performance of graph diffusion models, with gains up 10\\%, but also to substantially booster model robustness under uncertainties.",

Using zigzag persistence, ZS extracts key topological descriptors across multiple resolutions in dynamic graphs, addressing limitations in current models' generalizability. Theoretical stability guarantees for ZS are provided, and it represents the first integration of dynamic topological information in graph diffusion models. Experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance even up to 10%."

Proposition 3.2 seems to be a simple derivation from proposition 3.2 of Chen et al. (2022). Please further clarify the significance of this proposition. Meanwhile, there exist explicit notation errors in Proposition 3.2 between PDz_alpha_k and PDz\u2019_alpha_k, which should be avoided in the submission.\n\n4. The bootstrap version of ZS is proposed. However, no theoretical analysis of accuracy is provided due to the inherent challenges. I would suggest the authors provide some empirical results or analyses at least.\n\n5. Zigzag spaghetti is proposed as computation efficiency, which remains unclear from a theoretical perspective. Please justify this by comparing its time complexity with existing metrics.\n\n6. Figure 1 is proposed to illustrate the proposed ZS. I suggest the authors provide the necessary explanations for better clarity."
