    "title": "CityGaussianV2: Efficient and Geometrically Accurate Reconstruction for Large-Scale Scenes",
    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized radiance field reconstruction, manifesting efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, accurately representing surfaces, especially in large and complex scenarios, remains a significant challenge due to the unstructured nature of 3DGS. In this paper, we present CityGaussianV2, a novel approach for large-scale scene reconstruction that addresses critical challenges related to geometric accuracy and efficiency. Building on the favorable generalization capabilities of 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), we address its convergence and scalability issues. Specifically, we implement a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique to eliminate blurry artifacts and accelerate convergence. To scale up, we introduce an elongation filter that mitigates Gaussian count explosion caused by 2DGS degeneration. Furthermore, we optimize the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10$\\times$ compression, at least 25\\% savings in training time, and a 50\\% decrease in memory usage. We also established standard geometry benchmarks under large-scale scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method strikes a promising balance between visual quality, geometric accuracy, as well as storage and training costs.",

The qualitative and quantitative results of the paper are outstanding. Compared to existing baselines, the paper demonstrates faster convergence, more accurate photo-realistic reconstruction and lower memory usage. \nMoreover, the reviewer appreciates additional contributions such as new evaluation criteria that better captures geometric details of larger scenes. The paper spends a lot of effort on being fair on evaluation. The method compares with all SotA methods that the reviewer is aware of."

While the paper has demonstrated a good way to fuse these existing works in a nice scalable manner, the provided contributions seem like multiple ad-hoc solutions to circumvent an underlying core problem: solving densification in a scalable way. \n\nIn other words, the reviewer expects solid theoretical reasoning on why their optimization techniques are justified, instead of relying on empirical demonstration of good qualitative results. Otherwise, it is hard to justify whether the contributions of the work provided by authors are coming from meta-fine tuning of the existing 3D reconstruction dataset, or whether they are actual improvements."

The manuscript explores outdoor reconstruction, yet it does not fully address the incorporation of techniques for improving robustness against variable lighting conditions and viewing angles. Techniques similar to the decoupled appearance models used in GOF could potentially bolster the system's adaptability.\n\n2. The proposed method employs an Elongation Filter to prevent excessive Gaussian numbers, but it lacks a mechanism for handling cases where splitting is necessary. Will directly limiting the Gaussian split result in some areas being under reconstruction? At the same time, why does the number of Gaussians in the method plus an Elongation Filter in Table 2 exceed the baseline? Shouldn't the filters be limited to the number of Gaussian functions?\n\n3. There appears to be a discrepancy between the Gaussian count reported in Figure 3 and the data presented in Table 2. The number of CityGaussian is less than that of the author's method (w Elongation Filter), it is inconsistent with the results shown in Table 2. \n\n4. The limitations are only briefly touched upon in the appendix. A detailed examination within the main body of the paper would provide a more balanced perspective and foster a clearer understanding of the method's scope and potential constraints.\n\n5. The metrics presented in Table 2 (e.g., number of Gaussians, processing time, memory usage) should specify the units of measurement to aid in interpretation."
