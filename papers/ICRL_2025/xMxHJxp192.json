    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular machine learning models designed to process graph-structured data through recursive neighborhood aggregations in the message passing process. When applied to semi-supervised node classification, the message-passing enables GNNs to understand short-range spatial interactions, but also causes them to suffer from over-smoothing and over-squashing. These challenges hinder model expressiveness and prevent the use of deeper models to capture long-range node interactions (LRIs) within the graph. Popular solutions for LRIs detection are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time complexity or fail to generalize across diverse graph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a mechanism called information flow control, which leverages a novel connectivity measure, called information flow score, to address over-smoothing and over-squashing with linear computational overhead, supported by theoretical evidence. Finally, to prove the efficacy of our methodology we design DeltaGNN, the first scalable and generalizable approach for long-range and short-range interaction detection. \nWe benchmark our model across 10 real-world datasets, including graphs with varying sizes, topologies, densities, and homophilic ratios, showing superior performance with limited computational complexity.",

The proposed method for addressing the problems of over-smoothing and over-squashing is both innovative and promising. The approach involves decoupling the original graph into a homophilic subgraph and a heterophilic subgraph using the proposed information flow score. Subsequently, the method performs dual aggregation on these subgraphs to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies.\n4.

More background knowledge and explanation, also examples, are required to help readers to understand the  measurement of aggregation velocity.\n\n2. The authors propose using $(\\triangle^2)^t_u = d(\\triangle^t_u - \\triangle^{t-1}_u)$ to measure the rate of change in the rate at which node embeddings are aggregated. However, $\\triangle^t_u$ and $\\triangle^{t-1}_u$ are outputs from different layers and thus belong to different spaces. Therefore, the rationale for measuring the distance between points in these two spaces is questionable. Please provide justification for this measurement.\n\n3. The Information Flow Control (IFC) mechanism is a core component of the proposed method. Therefore, the implementation details of the IFC mechanism, including the score hill ascent framework, should be included in the main text rather than in the appendix. As currently presented, the score hill ascent framework is difficult to follow.\n\n4. In Figure 2, some subgraphs are difficult to interpret. For example, the 'feature density - feature value' plot and the 'score - node' plot could benefit from additional clarification or improved labeling. What do the different curves in the feature density - feature value plot represent? Additionally, the phrase 'and enhance the graph score' lacks clarity. A definition of the term 'graph score' would be helpful.\n\n5. The proof of Lemma 1 is difficult to follow. Specific issues are detailed in the following list. **Additional background information and explanation are needed to help readers understand the proof**.\n   - In line 727, the term 'valid' is used to ensure that the assignment respects the given homophily ratio $\\mathcal{H}_u$. However, the concept of 'valid' is not clearly defined, and it is unclear how this term ensures compliance with the specified homophily ratio. Additional background information and explanation are needed to help readers understand these aspects.\n   - The relationship between $\\triangle^t_u$ and the valid assignment $s$ is not explained.\n   - In the equation $U(\\mathcal{H}_u)_u = \\operatorname{max}_{s\\in S}(\\triangle^t_u)$, the representation of $U$ is unclear.\n   - Due to the lack of clarity, it is not possible to understand why 'any node $u$ with $\\triangle^t_u > p$ will have $\\mathcal{H}_u < \\mathcal{H}$.'\n\n1. The phrase 'as this quantity depends on the homophily of the node $u$', in line 727,  requires clarification. It is not immediately apparent why this quantity should depend on the homophily of the node. A clear explanation is needed to elucidate this dependency.\n\n1. Mirror issues: a) in line 723, should \"neighbourhood $N(u)$\" be revised to \"neighbourhood $\\mathcal{N}(u)$\" to consist to notation of neighborhood? b) $\\bigoplus\\limits_{v \\in \\mathcal{N}(u)}\\mathbf{M}_u$ should be revised to $\\bigoplus\\limits_{v \\in \\mathcal{N}(u)}\\mathbf{M}_v$."

This discrepancy may be due to the fact that GIN uses sum aggregation, whereas other models typically use weighted mean aggregation. The sum aggregation in GIN likely results in a higher variance for $\\{\\sum\\limits_{v \\in \\mathcal{N}(u)}\\mathbf{M}_v \\mid u \\in \\mathcal{V}\\}$ compared to $\\{\\mathbf{M}_u \\mid u \\in \\mathcal{V}\\}.$  Consequently, the so-called 'aggregation velocity' depends not only on node features but also on node degrees. This suggests that the proposed method may not be well-suited for models that use sum aggregation. Is my understanding correct?"

This is not the case, and should be emphasized. Oversmoothing is a problem that occurs for *some* GNNs and is independent of the topology (as a phenomenon, not how quickly that occurs) and is somewhat orthogonal to long-range interactions since in the limit of many layers, node features become indistinguishable irrespectively of their distance. Oversquashing instead, is an issue that occurs for *all* 1-hop GNNs and is very much dependent on the topology (namely, their commute time) and hence affects long-range interactions, independent of the depth or the ability to capture local interactions.\n- Even more significantly, you keep overlapping the issue of oversmoothing with that of heterohily (for example Line 110, Line 121, Line 161 but this notion is repeated throughout the paper). This is wrong. While Definition 2.1 accounts for the labels, this to me represents more of a choice, as oversmoothing is the convergence of node features to the same representation over a connected component of the graph. As such, it is actually simply caused by low-frequencies dominating over high-frequencies in the graph spectrum. In fact, it can be mitigated or avoided by relying on architectures that do not operate via low-pass filters. I suspect that what you are implying here, is that oversmoothing becomes more of an issue in the presence of heterophily, as nodes with different labels become indistinguishable, but *this is a consequence of and not the cause of oversmoothing and should be rectified*.\n\n- Quite a few citations are missing in the related work, for example regarding rewiring [1,2,3] but also Graph-Transformers.. \n- The presentation of the framework is a little contrived (see my questions below). Also, while you try to distinguish yourself from graph-rewiring algorithms, your approach removes edges, and this is a key part of it. For this reason, I think it is a little misleading to distinguish yourself from graph rewiring techniques. You should be more specific, and mention that the rewiring is adaptive and based on GNN layer outputs more than topological connectivity measures.\n\n**Theory**\n\n- I am a little confused by Lemma 1. To me, the homophily of a node only depends on the label information and the topology and has nothing to do with the architecture being used and/or the features. This indeed seems to be reflected also in your Definition 2.2 where I am reading that $\\Phi$ can be taken to be the ground-truth label assignment. However, it seems that in Lemma 1 you are deriving the homophily of a node based on what can be mapped/separated from the node features, i.e. it has more to do with distinguishability from node features. If so, this should be clearly emphasized. As such, I would not really talk about homophily but node features separability.\n\n- I don\u2019t think that Lemma 2 is an actual Lemma since your proof is essentially a discussion based on  the results of Nguyen et al. You should remove the statement and replace it with a discussion based on what you have in the appendix. As it stands, I find it confusing and indeed informal, to a point that this is not a mathematical statement.\n\n- In light of my comments regarding Lemma 2, I don\u2019t think that your score definition is that well motivated. More precisely, I can see why the denominator makes sense in relation to oversmoothing, since it measures node features separability after rounds of message passing (and *not* homophily), but I struggle to see how the numerator relates to oversquashing. You should expand on the \u201cproof\u201d from Lemma 2, which is not really a proof, to better motivate this score.\n\n**Experiments**\n\nEvaluation is not  convincing. On all the benchmarks you used, it is highly debatable that long-range interactions are present at any level. In fact, I believe majority of people would argue that LRIs are not present on Cora, Pubmed, etc.. Additionally, datasets like Texas, Wisconsin, etc are known to have several issues and the community has proposed alternative options. I personally struggle to accept claims of \u201cstate of the art improvements by 1 %\u201d on the likes of Cora and Pubmed this day. Graphs like Cornell, Texas and Wisconsin are also extremely small and super sensitive to tuning. The paper overall proposed a methodology, and as such, should be thoroughly tested on more relevant benchmarks. \n\n[1]: Mitchell Black, Zhengchao Wan, Amir Nayyeri, and Yusu Wang.

What if now you have disconnected components? This process can only work if one identifies correctly node labels, but this is something that your algorithm in general cannot know in advance."
