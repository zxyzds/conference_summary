    "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel approach to improve the temperature profile prediction of furnaces in foundation industries, crucial for sustainable manufacturing. While existing methods like the Hottel Zone model are accurate, they lack real-time inference capabilities. Deep learning methods excel in speed and prediction but require careful generalization for real-world applications. We propose a regularization technique that leverages the Hottel Zone method to make deep neural networks physics-aware, improving prediction accuracy for furnace temperature profiles. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness on various neural network architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We also discussion the data generation involved.",

Could the physics-constrained regularization approach be adapted for other high-temperature processes or domains where similar physical constraints exist, such as chemical reactors or solar power systems? What modifications, if any, would be required? Could you discuss which aspects of your approach are furnace-specific versus which could be more easily adapted to other domains? \n\n3. The paper distinguishes this approach from typical PINNs. Could the authors elaborate on specific advantages of their approach over traditional PINNs in similar scenarios?\n\n4.

The results from MLP, LSTM, DLSTM, KAN and xLSTM and their physics-based improvements (PBMLP, PBLSTM, PBDLSTM, PBKAN and PBxLSTM) are compared. But this paper is to improve the neural networks using Hettel Zone constraint, I think the results from pure Hettel Zone method should also be included. If it is a matter of pages limit, I suggest to move some text of the background of the proposed method (in Section 3) to the appendix. Other than that, the author should consider does it really neccessary to compare the results from so many neural networks with simple structures. Adding physics terms in loss function is a normal method, like in continuum fluid mechanics, so this is an application of PINN in furnace temperature prediction. The author should also check the grammar, such as the last sentence of the Abstract (\"We also discussion the data generation involved\")."

Important information for evaluation is dispersed throughout the paper at varied locations, including a quite lengthy appendix. A more organized structure would enhance the clarity of the paper. Consider compressing the important information in tables wherever possible, instead of paragraphs. \n\nOriginality/Novelty: \n1. The claim of being \"first-of-its-kind\" is questionable in light of a paper presented at NeurIPS 2023 workshop (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16089), which has not been cited. What is the improvement achieved over earlier results? In contrast, the results reported here appear to be inferior going by the scale of error metric values. A comparative analysis with the mentioned work would be beneficial to clarify this discrepancy.\n2. Investigation of Physics-constraints in variety of neural network architecture does not add value to the paper. The reason of choosing these specific network architectures is also not clear.  \n3. Hottel zone method seems to take only 5 minutes for simulating temperatures across entire furnace for a 341 minute real process. For 1 time step, the PCNN model takes 0.5 seconds. What is the total time taken by PCNN for 341 minute process prediction? From a practical standpoint, is it even worth developing the PCNN model that accelerates the prediction marginally while losing accuracy? \n\nFinally, while this work is an important piece of applied ML work, it does not qualify as an original contribution to the field of machine learning in reviewer's opinion."
