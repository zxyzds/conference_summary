    "title": "Does Vector Quantization Fail in Spatio-Temporal Forecasting? Exploring a Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization Approach",
    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in various fields and requires a careful balance between identifying subtle patterns and filtering out noise. Vector quantization (VQ) appears well-suited for this purpose, as it quantizes input vectors into a set of codebook vectors or patterns. Although vector quantization (VQ) has shown promise in various computer vision tasks, it surprisingly falls short in enhancing the accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting. We attribute this to two main issues: inaccurate optimization due to non-differentiability and limited representation power in hard VQ. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Sparse Soft-Vector Quantization (SVQ), the first VQ method to enhance spatio-temporal forecasting. SVQ balances detail preservation with noise reduction, offering full differentiability and a solid foundation in sparse regression. Our approach employs a two-layer MLP and an extensive codebook to streamline the sparse regression process, significantly cutting computational costs while simplifying training and improving performance. Empirical studies on five spatio-temporal benchmark datasets show SVQ achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 7.9\\% improvement on the WeatherBench-S temperature dataset and an average MAE reduction of 9.4\\% in video prediction benchmarks (Human3.6M, KTH, and KittiCaltech), along with a 17.3\\% enhancement in image quality (LPIPS).

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The novelty of the approach is limited, and the performance improvement appears marginal. Furthermore, there is no discussion on the additional computational overhead that these slight performance enhancements (such as those observed in wind speed and humidity in Table 1, and in the KTH dataset in Table 2, as well as in Table 18) will incur. A more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by SVQ, compared to baseline methods, is needed, especially for cases where the performance gains are smaller.\n\n2. The motivation is unclear. It is not surprising to use huge codebook and sparse representation to improve the effect, because huge codebook itself brings a lot of extra parameter redundancy. So why use vector quantization? Because in other fields (e.g., video compression, video generation), VQ is to compress redundant information, not to add redundant information. You could further explain their rationale for using vector quantization in this context, given its typical use for compression in other fields.\n\n3. The theoretical analysis provided seems unrelated to the content of the article. Furthermore, the article fails to discuss the relationship between the information or features extracted after compression using SVQ and the original spatiotemporal data. Consequently, there is a notable lack of corresponding theoretical discussion. A more in-depth exploration of how the features learned through SVQ are related to the original spatiotemporal data would greatly aid in fully elucidating the mechanism underlying SVQ.\n\n4. The ablation study conducted is insufficient. There is no doubt that setting the code size to 10000 will yield better performance compared to 1000. A more detailed discussion of the trade-offs involved (such as efficiency, convergence, etc.) with larger code sizes would be helpful.\n\n5. The introduction of redundant over-complete codebooks and additional computational overhead has resulted in a lack of discussion on computational efficiency, speed, and complexity, among other factors. Empirical measurements of training and inference times, memory usage, and computational complexity, as a function of codebook size, would provide a more comprehensive illustration of the advantages of SVQ."

Why not compare the same subjects? What are the differences in SVQ performance across different physical quantities and data scales?"

While the authors discuss optimization strategies, they fail to provide a clear connection between these theoretical claims and the practical outcomes. A more comprehensive explanation of how these optimization techniques directly enhance quantization would bolster the credibility of their approach.\n\tIn the experimental section, I noticed that the baseline models employed are relatively outdated. Given the recent advancements in spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly the emergence of various diffusion-based methods that have demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance, it would be beneficial for the authors to consider incorporating these state-of-the-art models as baselines. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness and advantages.\n\tThe explanation of the quantization module's implementation lacks depth regarding its integration with the overall spatio-temporal forecasting model. While the authors outline the architecture and components involved, they do not provide sufficient details on how the quantization process interacts with other model elements or influences the final forecasting results. A more thorough exploration of these interactions would enhance the clarity and applicability of their proposed method.\n\tIn Section 4, the mathematical proof lacks clarity in the notation used, which may hinder readers' understanding. For example, what\u2019s the meaning of g' after Eq. (8)? Additionally, the proof does not establish a strong connection to the problem being addressed. I recommend revising this section to improve the clarity of the symbols and to explicitly link the proof to the main objectives of the paper."
