    "title": "MindDETR: Beyond Semantics, Exploring Positional Cues from Brain Activity",
    "abstract": "Decoding visual stimuli from brain recordings offers a unique opportunity to understand how the brain represents the world and seeks to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. Recent efforts mainly adopt diffusion models to reconstruct images from brain signals. However, while these methods generally capture correct semantic information, they often struggle with precise object localization. Additionally, the commonly used proxy task, image reconstruction from brain signals, mainly measures semantic consistency, to some extent neglecting positional information of the decoded signals. In this work, to encourage more accurate brain signal decoding, we propose to use object detection as the proxy task, aiming at decoding both the semantic and positional cues from brain recordings. Based on this task, we propose MindDETR, a brain recording-based object detection model with the DETR pipeline. After aligning feature representations with a pretrained image-based DETR model, our model demonstrates that accurately brain decoding at both semantic and positional levels is feasible, and our detection-based approach achieves significantly superior results than existing reconstruction-based approaches. This result suggests the effectiveness of applying object detection as a proxy task for brain signal decoding.  Our code will be publicly available.",

                "value": "1.\tThe motivation of this paper is ambiguous to me. \n + Is it proposed to tackle the issue of inaccurate positional features among brain signal decoding (as stated in Sec. 1 and Sec. A.2)? It is a very good question, but instead of solving this issue, this paper raises a new brain decoding task about object detection.\n + Can the proposed proxy task of object detection promote positional awareness during reconstructing visual stimulus from fMRI signals? This paper doesn\u2019t discuss this point.\n + Is it proposed to reveal that the fMRI signals from NSD dataset can do the detection task (claimed as the second contribution in L95)? From the experimental results, the detection performance is not satisfactory (e.g., 8.5 AP_{50} for all objects)\n\n2. The proposed framework primarily uses non-linear functions to map brain signal embedding to image features, to fulfill the task of object detection. From the perspective of computer vision, this is a common operation for feature alignment, especially in the current era of multimodal tasks. IMO, the quality of feature alignment depends on the validity or consistency of two features. Thus, my concern is whether the fMRI signals from NSD datasets are really suitable for object detection or whether brain activity should be collected while asking subjects to do something like object detection. This point is not well discussed or analyzed in depth by the authors, and the experimental results (i.e., metrics for object detection) are not good. I understand that it may be beyond the scope of this paper (more like the field of brain neuroscience), but without this assumption or premise, the significance of this paper is very unclear.\n\n3. The technical novelty of this proposed method is limited. Both the usage of low- and high-level features and the feature alignment via distillation have been proposed by previous literature [A,B,C]. In addition, why does the larger kernel size yield better results? The author didn\u2019t provide any explanation in Sec. 3.3 or 4.4. It is more of an experimental hyper-parameter selection, with no basis.\n\n4. In Tab. 1, the proposed MindDETR achieves better results than MindEye. Could the author briefly describe the implementation of MindEye for object detection, and also state the architectural differences with the proposed method?\n\n5. Are the visualizations in Fig.3 cherry-picked? As seen from Tab. 2, the precision and recall of the proposed method actually are not high. It would be better to provide in-depth discussions of the failure cases.\n\n6. The discussion about Fig. 4 is not convincing. First of all, MindEye is for image reconstruction and MindDETR is for object detection. Two results are not comparable. Second, the proposed MindDETR also shows differences among different subjects, including the position, scale, and confidence of bounding boxes. Especially for multiple objects, the difference between individual results will be more obvious (like Fig.4 (e) and (f)). Besides, the subtitle of \u2018Consisteny among different objects\u2019 should be \u2018Consistency among different subjects\u2019.\n\n[A] Scotti, Paul, et al. \"Reconstructing the mind's eye: fMRI-to-image with contrastive learning and diffusion priors.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024)\n\n[B] Ozcelik, Furkan, and Rufin VanRullen. \"Natural scene reconstruction from fMRI signals using generative latent diffusion.\" Scientific Reports 13.1 (2023): 15666\n\n[C] Liu, Yulong, et al. \"BrainCLIP: Bridging brain and visual-linguistic representation via CLIP for generic natural visual stimulus decoding.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.12971 (2023)."

First of all, I believe the proxy task of object detection should not be a standalone task; rather, it should serve as an auxiliary task to enhance brain decoding performance. The images in the participant's mind may differ significantly from those they view.\n\n2. Comparing the bounding boxes predicted by MindDETR on ground truth images with those predicted by baseline models on reconstructed images is quite unfair. I suggest that the authors compare the performance of all models (except for the standard object detection model) on reconstructed images using the predicted bounding boxes.\n\n3. In line 310, please explain in detail how object detection is conducted on these reconstructed images. Which object detection model did you use? This clarification may help address any concerns about the fairness of the experimental results.\n\n4. Brain decoding primarily relies on visual regions (ROIs) in the human brain, but I believe object location may depend on certain cognitive regions. I suggest some exploration in this area."

As an innovative paper, it is particularly important to utilize a separate section to **discuss in detail the use of fMRI target detection for neuroscience or brain visual decoding**, which is relevant for judging the value of this paper.\n\n#### 2. Lack analysis for limited performance\nThe accuracy of fMRI object detection is still low and the authors should further discuss the reasons for this result.\n\n#### 3. Lack of analysis of error cases\nBased on the quantitative results of the experiments, there should be many cases of incorrect detection, and the authors should analyze the incorrect cases rather than just showing the correct ones.
