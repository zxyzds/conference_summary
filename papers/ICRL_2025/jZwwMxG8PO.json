    "title": "Extending Mercer's expansion to indefinite and asymmetric kernels",
    "abstract": "Mercer's expansion and Mercer's theorem are cornerstone results in kernel theory. While the classical Mercer's theorem only considers continuous symmetric positive definite kernels, analogous expansions are effective in practice for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. In this paper we extend Mercer's expansion to continuous kernels, providing a rigorous theoretical underpinning for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. We begin by demonstrating that Mercer's expansion may not be pointwise convergent for continuous indefinite kernels, before proving that the expansion of continuous kernels with bounded variation uniformly in each variable separably converges pointwise almost everywhere, almost uniformly, and unconditionally almost everywhere. We also describe an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels and give new decay bounds on its terms.",

                "value": "This paper extended  Mercer\u2019s theorem to any continuous kernels with bounded range, removing the original requirement for the kernel function to be symmetric and positive definite. Two main results are derived in this paper: first, it is proven that Mercer's expansion may not converge absolutely and uniformly for indefinite kernel; second, it is proven that a kernel with uniform bounded variation has Mercer's expansion that coverges pointwise a.e., a.u. and unconditionally a.e.. Notably, the authors described an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels."

The authors provide several examples of this behavior:\n   - 1. It does not converge pointwise.\n   - 2. It converges pointwise but not absolutely.\n   - 3.

If it is novel, it is worth to explain more on the algorithm's complexity and accuracy. \n3. In line 639 \"We believe the bounds in eq.
