    "title": "Spectral Shaping for Neural PDE Surrogates",
    "abstract": "Neural surrogates for PDE solvers suffer from an inability to model the spectrum of solutions adequately, especially in the medium to high frequency bands. This impacts not only correct spectral shapes, but also stability and long-term rollout accuracy. We identify three convergent factors that exacerbate this phenomenon, namely: distribution shift over unrolls, spectral bias of the MSE loss, and spurious high frequency noise, or _spectral junk_, introduced by the use of pointwise nonlinearities. We find that _spectral shaping_, filtering the spectrum of activations after every layer of pointwise nonlinearities, is enough to reduce spectral junk and improve long-term rollout accuracy. We show spectral shaping not only fixes the learned spectrum (down to machine precision in some cases), but also leads to very stable neural surrogates. We validate these findings on a suite of challenging fluid dynamics problems in the field of neural PDE surrogacy, promoting a clear need for more careful attention to surrogate architecture design and adding a new and simple trick to the practitioner toolbox.",

The proposed method applies a low-pass filter after each pointwise nonlinearity in the network to mitigate the so-called spectral junk in long rollouts.

Would an adaptive filtering mechanism be feasible? A study with different filters and their performance in the proposed setting would also aid in understanding the robustness of the proposed approach.\n\nDid the authors experiment with placing the filter at different stages in the network (e.g., after every few layers instead of each nonlinearity), and how did that affect performance?\n\nSince the authors argue that MSE loss biases the model towards low frequencies, How would the proposed method behave with alternative loss functions that could complement spectral shaping? \n\nAs a general remark, how does the proposed method guarantee that the errors are smoothed rather than smoothing out important features of the solution?

The inability to model high-frequency behavior is attributed to the spectral bias of the MSE loss, distribution shift, and noise produced by non-linearities in the model. The authors conducted a study on the frequency behavior of the model, including an analysis of the eigen-spectrum. They propose to overcome the noise produced by the model by applying a fixed, preset noise filter after each non-linearity in the model.

Besides the eigen-spectrum analysis, most of the insights from the presented study have already been presented in other works. The inability to model high-frequency noise is a known problem and has been described in previous publications. (Lippe 2024, McCabe 2023). In McCabe et al. (2023), the noise problem was explicitly attributed to the non-linearity, and they proposed to learn to filter this noise out (although for FNO). In Raoni\u0107 et al. (2024), formal solutions are introduced to avoid aliasing produced by non-linearities in convolutional models.\n2. The proposed method is not compared against any other architectural methods that tackle the noise problem, e.g., PDERefiner, in the experiments. While the presented method is computationally cheaper, the question remains whether it can increase the decorrelation time as much as the other methods tackling the high-frequency noise problem. \n3. The method is only evaluated for a single model (U-Net). This leads to the question of whether the good experimental results are due to using a model that may be especially prone to producing high-frequency noise. For example, the paper could be improved by evaluating whether the filter helps FNO. This would also allow a comparison to the method of McCabe et al. (2023).\n4.

                "value": "**Main Comments**\n\nIn contrast with the literature on neural PDE solvers, the background literature around the effect of nonlinearities on the spectrum and filtering has not been sufficiently explored. This is a major drawback of the paper and something that should be improved in order to accept it for publication and a number of related papers are referenced at the end of this review. In order to make this work worthy of publication, a much more thorough evaluation of the literature around spectral shaping should be carried out and therefore, in its current form, I would lean towards rejecting the paper unless the following points can be addressed. \n\nThis is especially true because a survey of some of the literature around this area will not only provide a more complete background to the work, but also give a theoretical underpinning to some of the phenomena that are described. \nFor example from the \u201cintegration by parts coefficient bound\u201d described by [1], if the function is smooth up to and including its $(k-2)^\\text{th}$ derivative, and its $k^\\text{th}$ derivative is integrable, then the Fourier coefficients decrease as $O(\\xi^{-k})$. This provides a possible reason for the increase in spectrum at mid and high frequencies due to discontinuities. In particular, I am skeptical that the post-nonlinearity increase observed at higher frequencies is indeed \"noise\" as the authors describe, instead they may be due to the change in spectral shape due to discontinuities. In addition, the excellent survey by [5] also links these effects back to the original observation by Gibbs [2,3] regarding the interaction between discontinuities in the time (frequency) domain and the shape in the frequency (time) domain.  In order to provide evidence for this the authors could experimentally examine the relationship between the order of the discontinuity and the shape of the spectrum.\n\nThe work by [1] also provides a motivation for the requirement for the filters to be applied after each stage, rather than once at the end; as the signal energy at the higher frequencies increases due to discontinuities, the effect of truncating the higher frequencies will be greater. This effect can be assessed by calculating the error that will be introduced by the discontinuities and comparing that to experimental observations. The work in [1,4] shows some example calculations of errors. \n\nIn addition to this background literature on the effect of discontinuities, some of the more significant literature on the subject of filtering should be included, e.g. [4,6,7]. This can provide some theoretical justification to the ultimate selection of the Gaussian filter, such as filter orders and experimental results from testing. \n\n[1] J. P. Boyd.

For example the use of ``sanity check\"  and \"probably\" in Section 5.1. \n\nAlso in Section 5.1, I would like a more formal justification for the statement \"The remain [sic] divergence for the spectral-shaped model could probably be remedied with a larger model or more training data.\" I think it likely that the addition theoretical work suggested in Section 2 of this review will also inform this improvement."
