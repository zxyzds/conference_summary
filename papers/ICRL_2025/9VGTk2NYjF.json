    "title": "The Complexity of Two-Team Polymatrix Games with Independent Adversaries",
    "abstract": "Adversarial multiplayer games are an important object of study in multiagent learning. In particular, polymatrix zero-sum games are a multiplayer setting where Nash equilibria are known to be efficiently computable. Towards understanding the limits of tractability in polymatrix games, we study the computation of Nash equilibria in such games where each pair of players plays either a zero-sum or a coordination game. We are particularly interested in the setting where players can be grouped into a small number of teams of identical interest. While the three-team version of the problem is known to be PPAD-complete, the complexity for two teams has remained open. Our main contribution is to prove that the two-team version remains hard, namely it is CLS-hard. Furthermore, we show that this lower bound is tight for the setting where one of the teams consists of multiple independent adversaries. On the way to obtaining our main result, we prove hardness of finding any stationary point in the simplest type of non-convex-concave min-max constrained optimization problem, namely for a class of bilinear polynomial objective functions.",

                "value": "In this work, the authors investigate the computational complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium in two-team zero-sum polymatrix games where one team consists of independent players (i.e., players who do not interact with one another). Specifically, they prove that this problem is complete for the complexity class CLS. To demonstrate hardness, they first reduce from MinQuadraticKKT\u2014the problem of computing a KKT point of a quadratic function with box constraints\u2014to MinmaxIndKKT, a min-max problem with an independence property they define. In a second step, they reduce this problem to a two-team zero-sum polymatrix game. Membership in CLS follows fairly straightforwardly from the recent result that QuadraticKKT is complete for the class CLS, as shown in [1], and using LP duality for transforming a min-max problem into a minimization."

                "value": "The paper is generally well-written, though there are areas where phrasing could be improved. The problem under consideration is quite interesting and represents a step forward in establishing complexity results for two-team (zero-sum) games, i.e., min-max optimization problems beyond the case of having coupled constraints as in [2]. Of course, the more general case of having dependent adversaries (or that of a single adversary) remains open, as the authors highlight in Section 5."

Although the techniques and ideas are not particularly complex\u2014as is often the case in results of this kind\u2014this should not in itself be considered a weakness. However, the simplicity of the proof and the lack of novel ideas makes me more skeptical about my final score."

                "value": "- **Line 386**: In the reduction from MinmaxIndKKT, the authors define the candidate KKT point $(x_i, y_i)$ for the case where neither $x_i$ nor $y_i$ is in ${0, 1\\}$ as $x_i = a_i$ and $y_i = d_i$. I assume that $a_i$ is simply a typo, as $a_i$ is already used to denote player $i$ on the first team. I think the authors likely intended to use $p_i$ and $q_i$ for $x_i$ and $y_i$, which would also align with the statement in line 415 indicating that these variables are close to their respective counterparts, $p_i$ and $q_i$.\n\nReferences  \n[1] The complexity of computing KKT solutions of quadratic programs.\n\n[2] Constantinos Daskalakis, Stratis Skoulakis, and Manolis Zampetakis.

                "value": "The paper studies the problem of finding Nash Equilibria in two-team polymatrix games. Polymatrix games are a special class of n-player games with a succinct representation of the payoff functions. Each player's payoff is a sum of payoffs resulting from two-player games played with all the other players. This problem is known to be tractable when all interactions are zero-sum, and to be PPAD-hard in general. A special subclass of these games are team games, where each pair of interactions are either zero-sum (different teams) or coordination games (same team). Three team games are known to be PPAD complete. The main result of the paper is in showing that two team games are CLS hard (CLS is a structured subclass of PPAD).  This result holds even when one of the team consists of independent adversaries (their games consist of the zero matrix for all the payoffs). They also show that computing the minimax/ KKT point of a bilinear polynomial is also CLS hard."

The open problems section also mentions gradient based methods that converge to equilibria in time poly(1/epsilon), but there is not further discussion."
