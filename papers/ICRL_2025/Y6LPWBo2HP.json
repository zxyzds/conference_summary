    "title": "Infinite-Resolution Integral Noise Warping for Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Adapting pretrained image-based diffusion models to generate temporally consistent videos has become an impactful generative modeling research direction. Training-free noise-space manipulation has proven to be an effective technique, where the challenge is to preserve the Gaussian white noise distribution while adding in temporal consistency. Recently, Chang et al. (2024) formulated this problem using an integral noise representation with distribution-preserving guarantees, and proposed an upsampling-based algorithm to compute it. However, while their mathematical formulation is advantageous, the algorithm incurs a high computational cost. Through analyzing the limiting-case behavior of their algorithm as the upsampling resolution goes to infinity, we develop an alternative algorithm that, by gathering increments of multiple Brownian bridges, achieves their infinite-resolution accuracy while simultaneously reducing the computational cost by orders of magnitude. We prove and experimentally validate our theoretical claims, and demonstrate our method's effectiveness in real-world applications. We further show that our method can readily extend to the 3-dimensional space.",

                "value": "The topic of the paper is to develop computationally efficient algorithms to use image diffusion models temporally, i.e. for generating consistent videos or solving video inverse problems. The authors innovate on the noise-warping mechanism and they propose a computationally efficient method to transform the noise between frames that preserves the Gaussian prior distribution. The authors experimentally validate their method for video super-resolution and 3-D problems."

                "value": "1) The biggest weakness of this paper is that the experimental results are very weak. I downloaded the supplementary material and looked at the videos; the quality is unsatisfactory. While the proposed method offers more consistency than the existing baselines, it is still very inconsistent. The extent of inconsistency is so high, that I can't think of any applications that would leverage this method. \n\n2) At the same time, I am not very confident that the considered approach is meaningful. It is true that at the moment there are many powerful image diffusion models and not so many video diffusion models. However, the current level of quality of solving inverse problems with image diffusion models appears to be very low, judging from the results of this paper. I am not sure if this is a fundamental limitation of the approach or whether it will be resolved in the future. But also, as time goes by, more and more powerful video diffusion models are becoming available that can be used as priors for solving temporal inverse problems.\n\n3) I believe that one of the reasons the experimental results are not that strong is the equivariance of the network itself. Even if the input noise transformations are properly handled, maybe the network itself does not provide equivariant predictions which could cause the creation of flickering and inconsistencies. This is argued in this work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16152. \n\n4) I also believe that the paper would benefit from more experiments on other inverse problems. Since a pre-trained prior is available, one could experiment with other types of problems such as inpainting or even denoising as the image follows simple geometrical transformations (zoom-in/out, shifts, etc)."

The authors address the computational inefficiency in Chang et al.'s (2024) method, which ensures temporal consistency but requires high-resolution upsampling. By shifting from a Lagrangian to an Eulerian perspective and using Brownian bridge increments instead of high-resolution upsampling, the approach achieves the same precision while significantly improving speed and memory efficiency. The author also introduces two methods for calculating noise overlap areas\u2014grid-based and particle-based. The particle-based approach is faster, more memory-efficient, and more robust to non-injective mappings. Results show that this method not only preserves Gaussian noise properties but also achieves speed improvements by several orders of magnitude, maintaining or even improving temporal consistency in video applications, making it more practical for real-world scenarios."

The ultimate computation goal is the same as in HIWYN: $ \\tilde I_{i,j}$ , as shown in Figure 1, the goal is to obtain the \"area\" of the red region $ \\tilde A_{i,j}$ . However, from the Eulerian View, it is evident that $ \\tilde A_{i,j} $ will be dispersed across each $ A_{i,j}$ ; in the example in Figure 2, this accounts for 39%. $ I_{i,j}$ can be considered a Brownian bridge from 0 to $ I_{i,j} $, and the area of each deformed region can be viewed as \"time.\" Using this, it might be possible to directly sample the 39% value of the Brownian bridge and then gather it with other red parts across various $ A_{i,j} $ regions to obtain the final $ \\tilde A_{i,j}$ . I am not sure if my understanding is correct. If this understanding is correct, then the differently colored regions within $A_{i,j}$ should originate from sampling with different conditions (as indicated by equation (1)), meaning that each color belongs to a different distribution. Would it then be valid to interpret this as an addition of values from Brownian bridges?"
