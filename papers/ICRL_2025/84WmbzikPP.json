    "abstract": "Molecular structure elucidation is a critical step in understanding chemical phenomena, with applications to identifying molecules in natural products, lab syntheses, forensic samples, and the interstellar medium.\nWe consider the task of elucidating a molecule's 3D structure from only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to precisely measure these moments.\nWhile existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy.\nTo address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\\textrm{St}(n, 4)$.\nWe then propose Stiefel flow matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints.\nAdditionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold.\nEmpirically, Stiefel flow matching achieves higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the molecular structure elucidation problem using a generative approach. This task involves inferring a molecule's 3D structure from its molecular formula and moments of inertia. Traditional generative models conditioned on moments of inertia fail to leverage the precision offered by rotational spectroscopy, which measures moments with high accuracy. The paper introduces Stiefel Flow Matching, a generative model that operates on the Stiefel manifold, where the set of point clouds with fixed moments of inertia is embedded. Empirical results demonstrate higher accuracy and efficiency in generating 3D molecular structures compared to Euclidean diffusion models."

This approach leverages manifold geometry to respect exact moment constraints, improving over traditional Euclidean diffusion models. \n- In general, the paper is written and formatted very well. I appreciate the consistent and well-written formalisms and figures, making the otherwise quite abstract paper well-readable. Moreover, the formalisms support the methodology of the work well. \n- The results show some performance improvements, particularly in maintaining moment constraints and reducing sampling cost.\n- This work has potential applications in chemistry, pharmacology, and materials science, where precise molecular structures are essential. By leveraging constraints from rotational spectroscopy, this model could significantly improve the accuracy of 3D structure predictions for unknown molecules."

I think some more concrete suggestions on how to improve these issues would be greatly beneficial.\n- Some connections to recent approaches to molecular generation with discrete flow matching are missing in the paper. Even though these problems consider a slightly different task as they operate on discrete domains, some intuition of why the authors' approach does not involve discrete dynamics/generation at all would be useful, as it intuitively would be beneficial for this task. \n- As far as I understand it, some of the alignment and validation steps rely on heuristic checks. Some reflection on how task-specific these are, or some intuition behind the thereby introduced bias would be useful.\n- While the authors provide some baseline comparisons, they are somewhat limited and some discussion on how Stiefel Flow Matching specifically outperforms or complements existing diffusion models on continuous or Riemannian spaces could benefit the paper. Moreover, adding more experimental results would aid in this too.\n- The paper is longer than 9 pages."

Could techniques from recent flow matching techniques or regularization methods improve performance? Alternatively, could a hybrid approach that combines Stiefel Flow Matching and discrete approaches maybe be beneficial here? \n- While optimal transport reduces trajectory length, it appears to slightly reduce success rates. Would a more flexible trade-off strategy that selectively applies optimal transport based on the target molecule\u2019s complexity yield better outcomes? Some comparisons here would be nice. On a similar note, the paper embeds the structure space on the Stiefel manifold, which assumes exact moment constraints. Have the authors considered using approximate embeddings on simpler manifolds for faster computation at the expense of slight constraint violations?\n- Do I understand correctly the canonical metric on the Stiefel manifold is used? Given recent developments in Riemannian FM, did the authors explore alternative Riemannian metrics?"

Why Theorem 4 is put in the Appendix? \n\n- The sampling procedure is not as clearly presented as the training of $v_\\theta$. Methmatical procedure of how the pre-trained $v_\\theta$ is employed to perform sampling is needed. \n\n- In practice, the authors use t=0.001 to 1, but the uniform distribution in (8) uses U[0,1].

                "value": "1. The idea of the moment-constrained generation is not well-motivated in the paper.\n    - **Molecules are not rigid bodies**. The dynamics of a molecule (e.g., stretching, twisting of bonds) make it possible for it to have various conformations that vary slightly by their principal moment of inertia. In other words, the moment of inertia measured by rotational spectroscopy is an ensemble property that reflects the average (or effective) moment of inertia of a molecule. In this sense, it seems more reasonable to allow for some violation of the moment constraints.\n    - **Practical applications are missing**. It remains unclear what the practical applications of generating molecules with specific moments are. As an example, generating molecules with a specific HOMO-LUMO gap can be significant to the discovery of photoelectric molecules. The moment of inertia, however, does not hold a specific connection to real-world applications.\n\n2. **The number of baselines compared in the paper was small**. Indeed, only KREED was compared. There are other baselines available:\n    - The conditional generative model in [1] where molecular properties are fed as additional information during both training and sampling for the conditional generation of molecules with desired properties. As the generative model implicitly learns the connection between the property and the molecule, it does not guarantee the exact satisfaction of constraints, but in practice, it does provide fairly competitive generation results. \n    - As it is always possible to project the generation to the corresponding Stiefel manifold according to Appendix B.6, another natural baseline would be directly projecting the unconstrained generation onto the Stiefel manifold, which also ensures the exact moment constraints.\n\n3. **The experimental results were not convincing enough** to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Although the moment constraint errors were indeed zero, the validity and stability scores were worse. The RMSD percentage also outperformed the baseline by only a small margin on the GEOM dataset.\n\n4. **The filtering procedure on the GEOM evaluation may give the proposed model with inappropriate advantages**, as it is essentially picking from a larger number of generations with a high likelihood of finding better samples. A similar procedure should be applied to the KREED baseline for a fair comparison.\n\n[1] Hoogeboom, Emiel, et al. \"Equivariant diffusion for molecule generation in 3d.\" International conference on machine learning.

See Weakness 3 & 4.\n4. What is the empirical training and sampling time of the proposed method compared to a normal unconstrained Euclidean flow matching model? I would expect extra time as the exponential map and logarithm map on the Stiefel manifold are far more complex to compute. Nonetheless, it is always beneficial to know the empirical time.\n5. The logarithm map was calculated with 20 iterations. Does it provide a good enough approximation? Can you provide an analysis of the logarithm errors with respect to the number of iterations to better demonstrate your choice of 20 iterations (and 1 iteration for OT)?"
