    "abstract": "The precise localization of 2D echocardiography planes in relation to a dynamic heart necessitates specialized expertise, as existing automated algorithms prmarily classify standard views while lacking the capability for comprehensive 3D structural perception. Traditional measurement techniques have evolved to infer 3D heart geometry, yet recent advancements in artificial intelligence, though demonstrating spatial awareness, still fall short in providing explicit 3D modeling. CTA-based digital twins, while promising, are hindered by cost and radiation concerns. Echocardiography, being cost-effective and radiation-free, remains limited in its ability to provide 3D perception. To address this gap, we introduce a novel point cloud-based weakly supervised 3D generation network specifically tailored for echocardiograms. This network automates 3D heart inference, and biomarker modeling, based on 2D echocardiography, slice tracking. To further enhance accuracy, we integrated a self-supervised learning branch into our framework, introducing multi-structure reconstruction loss and an overall reconstruction loss specifically designed for cardiac structure completion. Additionally, we constructed a comparative branch that serves to bolster the network's precision in inferring cardiac structures, thereby refining our approach and elevating the fidelity of the generated 3D models. Our approach enables real-time, robust 3D heart modeling, independent of paired data requirements, thereby facilitating research advancements in echocardiographic digital twins.",

What is the difference between the view completion and view reconstruction decoders? It seems that they can be merged into one decoder.\n2. The paper proposed to solve the shape completion problem. But shape completion is a large collection of problems and need to be better defined in this paper. Shape completion seems to mean inferring 3D geometry from 2D planes, but what if some 2D views are missing? Does this model still work?\n3. The figures need to be improved. For example, in Figure 5, curve plots (for showing the trends) are improper for comparing different heart components here. Bar plots should be better.  \n4. The evaluation metrics should have been better designed and illustrated. Are the geometric distances, e.g., the chamfer distances, calculated on normalized point clouds? However, the actual distances in mm are also desired. And how big is the heart, e.g., in mm? And how are the distances compared to the actual size of the heart? How applicable is this approach to real scenarios?\n5. For localization, why the threshold is 2mm?"

First, this paper can benefit from releasing the dataset since all the designs serve this dataset, which has a large amount of CTA data corresponding to cardiac structures. Such a dataset can help train a robust network for accurate cardiac structural prediction.\n\n2. A drawback of this task is using only the segmentation (cardiac structure contours) predicted by the 3D CNN network from CTA images for 3D shape prediction. We are not able to ensure the echocardiography scanned in the real scenarios can also make the closed shape compared with the prediction from CTA. For example, the CTA scans always have a fixed position for cardiac, and the imaging quality is much better than the echocardiography. In contrast, due to the different imaging principles, echocardiography often has relatively large distortion with poor image quality, and image acquisition highly depends on the sonographer's experience.\n\n3. With weakness 2, I consider that the experiment can be improved by using some image pair. The author can collect both CTA and echocardiography data from the same patient/person. Then, the experiment can utilize real echocardiography to predict the 3D cardiac structures. With this experiment, the author can also demonstrate that the proposed approach has overcome the following points: \ni). What is the domain gap between CTA and echocardiography when applying this method? ii). Can this method actually be applied in echocardiography? iii). With the pair of CTA and echocardiography, the result could be more convincing.\n\n4. The network is designed only for this task; I don\u2019t think this network has much innovation because all modules and designs are integrated with other methods. For example, global and local features, coarse to fine, some argumentations, etc."
