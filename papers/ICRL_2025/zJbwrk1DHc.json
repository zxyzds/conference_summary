    "title": "Hierarchical Classification via Diffusion on Manifolds",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical classification, the problem of classifying images according to a predefined hierarchical taxonomy, has practical significance owing to the principle of ``making better mistakes'', i.e., better to predict correct coarse labels than incorrect fine labels. Yet, it is insufficiently studied in literature, presumably because simply finetuning a pretrained deep neural network using the cross-entropy loss on leaf classes already leads to good performance w.r.t not only the popular top-1 accuracy but also hierarchical metrics. Despite the empirical effectiveness of finetuning pretrained models, we argue that hierarchical classification could be better addressed by explicitly regularizing finetuning w.r.t the predefined hierarchical taxonomy. Intuitively, with a pretrained model, data lies in hierarchical manifolds in the feature space. Hence, we propose a hierarchical multimodal contrastive finetuning method to leverage taxonomic hierarchy to finetune a pretrained model for better hierarchical classification. Moreover, the hierarchical manifolds motivate a graph diffusion-based method to adjust posteriors at hierarchical levels altogether in inference. This distinguishes our method from the existing ones, including top-down approaches (using coarse-class predictions to adjust fine-class predictions) and bottom-up approaches (processing fine-class predictions towards coarse-label predictions). We validate our method on two large-scale datasets, iNat18 and iNat21. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior arts w.r.t both top-1 accuracy and established hierarchical metrics, thanks to our new multi-modal hierarchical contrastive training and graph-diffusion-based inference.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a training and inference method to address hierarchical classification, based on the assumption of hierarchical manifolds. First, a graph diffusion-based approach is introduced, utilizing predictions at all levels, which differs from traditional bottom-up/top-down inference methods. Next, hierarchical multi-modal contrastive finetuning is proposed. The approach demonstrated good performance on the iNat18/21 dataset, and various ablation studies were conducted to validate the proposed method."

                "value": "**Clarity**\n\n1. Figure 1 is difficult to understand. Please provide more explanation. Also, is it a visualization of actual features? If so, how was it created? If it\u2019s intended as an intuitive example, not actual data, what evidence supports this specific representation?  \n\n2. While the hypothesis of hierarchical manifolds serves as a key motivation for the proposed method (Lines 165-169 & Figure 1), it is difficult to find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis. Specifically, why do pretrained features lie on a hierarchical manifold? I believe the structure of the feature space is significantly influenced by the training process, including factors such as the choice of loss function, model architecture, and data labeling. These factors can lead to feature spaces that do not strictly conform to hierarchical manifolds. This is why some previous works focus on learning or embedding hierarchical structures within the latent space [1, 2]. Furthermore, hierarchical relationships in real-world data may not always be represented by nested structures. As such, this assumption appears somewhat oversimplified. If the intention was to convey that the data does not inherently lie on a hierarchical manifold but must be trained to conform to one, it would be beneficial to clarify this in the writing.\n\n3. Since the hypothesis regarding hierarchical manifolds is not clear, it is difficult to understand how graph-diffusion inference can be leveraged even in the absence of HMCF (Figure 1(a)). In other words, what is the relationship between graph-diffusion inference and hierarchical manifold? Isn\u2019t it possible to conduct graph diffusion-based inference using the relationships among all labels, even without the discussion about the hierarchical manifold?\n\n4. Some sections of the writing appear unorganized. For example, in Line 84, the abbreviation \"HMCF\" is introduced before it is defined. Additionally, in Line 188,Is \u201c14,036\u201d referring to the number of test samples or the total number of hierarchical labels? Making these points clearer would enhance the conciseness of the writing.\n\n\n\n**Originality** \n\n5. The hierarchical contrastive learning method that utilizes labels at all levels has been proposed previously [3], so its novelty here is somewhat limited. It would be helpful to clarify how the proposed approach differs from [3]. \n\n**Quality** \n\n6. Relatedly, there are many additional experiments in the Appendix that are not referenced in the main text (except for Table 5). If these experiments are relevant and essential to this method, it would be helpful to mention them in the main text so that readers can find them.  \n\n7. Some important works seem to be missing from the Related Work section. In addition to top-down and bottom-up approaches, there are hierarchical classification studies that use multi-branch architectures to predict all levels simultaneously based on the complete label hierarchy [4, 5]. A comparison with these approaches would be helpful. These studies aim to address the question raised in Lines 163\u2013164: \u201cCan the predictions across different levels in the category hierarchy mutually reinforce each other to improve overall accuracy?\u201d and are driven by similar motivations.\n\n\n8.

(2) to (4). It is not that straightforward. \n- [General] I feel using \"graph diffusion\" might be confusing as most recently there is a new branch in literature that focuses on using Diffusion models (in computer vision) over graphs.
