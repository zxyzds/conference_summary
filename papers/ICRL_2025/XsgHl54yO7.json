    "abstract": "Generative models on discrete state-spaces have a wide range of potential applications, particularly in the domain of natural sciences. In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.",

In addition, the article is more inclined to show the effect of guidance and ignore the quality of generation, so it is difficult for readers to judge the practicality of this guidance framework. Finally, judging from the process of theoretical derivation, the technical route of this work seems to be weak in innovation."

Is it that instead of $p^\\phi(y|x,t)$, we only store $\\nabla_x \\log p^\\phi(y|x,t)$? What if there is no discernible order of the discrete states? How can we embed the discrete states into a continuous space for the Taylor approximation?"

                "value": "The term coined \"discrete guidance\" seems too general since there is already another competing approach called DiGress (Vignac et al. ICLR 2023) and also Dirichlet FM, sometimes with similar performance\n(eg 423 \"As predictor-free guidance for DirFM-CFG and DG-PFG behaved comparably (Appendix F.3.5)\")\nIn that respect, the empirical results being relatively close to DiGress, the title of the paper is also a bit problematic  in my opinion.\n\nThe mathematical presentation in the main paper is a too quick summary in my opinion.\nEquation (3) is only valid for tilde x different than x, and flow conservation is used for setting R gamma(x,x) (Equation 25). This should be included in the main text.\nI read Appendix C and was a bit confused by the presentation.\nAt first I was surprised with key differences: In Equation (14) the numerator depends on both x tilde and x while in Equations (2) and (3) it only depends on the state x tilde. The simplification is discussed later in Section C.6, but I would have like to read this just below Equation (14).\n\n216: The text suggests gamma is between 0 and 1, but it is used with very high values (2, 10, 100) later on. I would suggests to discuss the range of gamma right away.\n\nIn the experiments, the value of gamma used for each experiment is not reported clearly.\n\nThe presentation of the experiments is also very dense.\nSomehow the conditioning mechanisms are not very clear.\nOne practical issue with classifier and/or classifier-free guidance is the need to eihter train a classifier on noisy data or to train a conditional generative model.\nHere the effort needed for retraining is not clear, eg\n419 For Discrete Guidance, we trained an unconditional flow-matching model, then used predictor guidance with either exact (DG-Exact) or Taylor-approximated guidance (DG-TAG).\nHow was the predictor trained ? Is there any example that is training-free ? (see question below)\n\n\nMinor corrections / suggestions:\n109 The text suggests that the gradient of the predictor is easily accessible of continuous DM but this is not the case and based on heuristics (eg using a classifier or assuming a Gaussian form for the distribution).\n140 Why \"However\" ?\n145 Say right away that the rate function is positive but can take negative value when x tilde equals x. Also precise the meaning of the Kroenecker delta symbol.\n214: This footnote is already useful for p. 3\n412: *an* conditional flow-matching model\n897 Cl\u2019ement Vignac (accent issue)"

Is the formalism similar ?\n\nThere exists training-free guidance strategies for solving imaging inverse problems using diffusion models, eg:\n\nDiffusion Posterior Sampling for General Noisy Inverse Problems\nHyungjin Chung, Jeongsol Kim, Michael Thompson Mccann, Marc Louis Klasky, Jong Chul Ye\nICLR 2023\n\nPseudoinverse-Guided Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems\nJiaming Song, Arash Vahdat, Morteza Mardani, Jan Kautz\nICLR 2023\n\nAre training-free guidance achievable for discrete diffusion/flow models?"
