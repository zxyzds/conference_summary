    "title": "Deep Clustering and Interpolation via the Federated Self-Organizing Map",
    "abstract": "We introduce FedSOM, a clustering and interpolation module based on the Self-organizing Map (SOM), which can be appended to any encoder and which can be trained in a federated way either in tandem with the encoder or post training on the resulting representations.  The result is a discrete moduli space of representations that provides for cluster or sample-level interpolation, hierarchical clustering, and can be leveraged as a function to cluster new vectors at test time.  This moduli space can either be created from data alone or by glueing pre-existing clusters along regions of commonality, although we do not explore the latter in this work.  Interpolation is accomplished by considering the $n$-dimensional tensor underlying the SOM as a weighted undirected graph, where the weights are computed as a function of the dispersion of the two clusters corresponding to the nodes bounding the given edge.  Any two clusters or samples may then be interpolated by computing the lowest-cost path between their associated graph nodes via Dijkstra's algorithm.  The method is validated on MNIST-like and parsed-binary malware datasets.",

Proposed method FedSOM consists of multiple SOMs trained on the subset of data in the federated learning manner. Meta-SOM is learned on weight representations of each local SOM which is further used for clustering and interpolation. Method builds a graph using SOM nodes, and edges represent connections between neighboring nodes in the grid. Furthermore, proposed method can interpolate between two clusters or samples, which can be determined using Dijkstra's algorithm."

However, this \"federated\" component lacks substantial methodological novelty. The federated aspect here involves independently training multiple SOMs on distributed subsets and then combining their weights in a meta-SOM. This approach does not appear to incorporate any sophisticated techniques to handle common federated learning challenges, such as handling non-IID data or communication efficiency. \n2. The experiments are limited primarily to cybersecurity data and MNIST-like datasets, which limit the generalizability of FedSOM.  Since the authors claim the framework can handle diverse data types, additional experiments on more complex or heterogeneous datasets (e.g., non-image, tabular data, graph) are essential to support its model-agnostic claims.\n3. The authors stated that the SOM tensor dimensionality grows exponentially, which could introduce significant computational costs, especially as data size increases. However, this paper does not include any computational complexity analysis, which makes it difficult to assess the scalability of FedSOM.\n4. The reproducibility is very poor. The reviewer could not find the detailed experimental setup or reproducible source-code for the proposed method.\n5. The paper primarily compares FedSOM with older baselines, lacking the latest state-of-the-art methods. The comparisons with more advanced methods are essential to substantiate FedSOM\u2019s effectiveness."
