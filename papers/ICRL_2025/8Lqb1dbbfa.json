    "title": "FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction",
    "abstract": "Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level \\textbf{Fusion} module to effectively learn fine-grained information for \\textbf{D}rug-\\textbf{T}arget \\textbf{I}nteraction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with eight existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.",

Therefore, the novelty proposed by the authors is concerning.\n- The paper lacks a theoretical contribution regarding the proposed method for the DTI task.\n- In the case study for searching for binding sites, FusionDTI-CAN is adopted for comparison with DrugBAN. It seems more reasonable to use FusionDTI-BAN for a fair comparison, which raises confusion. So why not choose BAN as backbone model?\n- Although the TF module is useful, its computational complexity clearly indicates that it is quite time-consuming. What will happen if the model is faced with larger drug molecules or larger protein sequence datasets?\n- It should be clear whether the improvements benefit from the pre-trained language models.  The ablation results of w/o LLM pre-trained feature is needed."

FusionDTI appears to be more of **an integration of known pretrained encoders and existing interaction modules**. We may not gain new insights from this study into improving the computational simulation of drug-protein binding, as using attention mechanisms for atom-residue interactions is already a widely adopted strategy. This raises questions about the study\u2019s methodological novelty.\n\n- The model interpretation aspect of the study has several limitations:\n\n    - The selected cases for demonstrating FusionDTI's interpretability are **not representative**. Readers would be interested not only in the very top predictions but also in moderate and poor predictions (like some bad case analysis) because there is no clear threshold or metric provided to assess whether a prediction is good enough for practical interpretative use.\n\n     - Some inconsistencies in the case study results need to be addressed. For instance, GLN92 is highlighted in Table 5 but does not appear in Figure 9. Please double check that.\n\n    - Incorporating a **binding structure visualization analysis** would greatly enhance the comparison between the predicted interactions and the experimentally validated interactions. It would be also helpful for determining which one (FusionDTI or DrugBAN) aligns best with the known interactions.\n\n    - A better solution could involve **quantifying the attention visualization results**. For example, calculating how much of key residues or interactions are highlighted by attention weights on a larger scale dataset, such as PoseBusters or CASF, would help to verify the tool\u2019s effectiveness in elucidating drug-protein binding modes."

Comparative analysis against eight baseline methods demonstrates competitive performance, with the CAN fusion module showing superior capability in capturing fine-grained interactions compared to BAN. The authors provide interpretability analysis through case studies that align with known binding site information from crystallographic structures. \n\nWhile the implementation is technically sound and shows incremental improvements over existing methods, the primary innovation lies in the integration of established techniques rather than fundamental methodological advances in DTI prediction."
