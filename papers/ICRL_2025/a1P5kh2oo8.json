    "title": "Vinoground: Scrutinizing LMMs over Dense Temporal Reasoning with Short Videos",
    "abstract": "There has been growing sentiment recently that modern large multimodal models (LMMs) have addressed most of the key challenges related to short video comprehension. As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos. \nHowever, is this really the case?  Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos.  We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations.  For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains $\\sim$50\\% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of $\\sim$90\\%. All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance. Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved. We will make our benchmark publicly available.",

                "value": "This paper presents a dense temporal reasoning benchmark, named Vinoground, for checking CLIP-based and video LLM's capabilities on fundamental temporal counterfactual reasoning tasks. Vinoground contains 1000 video-caption pairs. The authors discuss how they collect counterfactual captions and curate videos for this benchmark. Also, the evaluation can be splitted into three main catergories: object, action, and viewpoint, or four minor categories: interaction, cyclical, spatial, contextual. The authors then discuss. how to evaluate models, either CLIP-based or LLM-based, on this benchmark, and find that today's sota models are struggling to do such temporal counterfactual reasoning tasks, while average crowdsourcing people perform well. The authors present detailed discussions about this results as well."

                "value": "This is overall a good paper investigating the dark side of today's video language models, especially video large language models, on dense temporal counterfactual tasks. The findings are quit interesting: 1. CLIP-based models perform worse than random guessing; 2. Chain-of-thoughts prompting can improve GPT4o but do not help most open-source video LLMs; 3. More frames (larger than 32 for near all models) do not lead to a better result on this dense temporal reasoning task. These may draw to a conclusion: today's video LLMs are performing simple pattern matching  (rather than reasoning). In my view, these findings are valuable and will have impact on further researches on this domain."

Is it due to incapable language encoders? Or incapable visual encoders? 3. Results of temporal random-permuted frames as these results can be more representative than `random chance` in the table since Vinoground is about temporal reasoning."

Vinoground comprises counterfactual video-caption pairs, where each pair of captions, generated by GPT-4, contains identical words arranged in different orders. The corresponding videos are collected from two sources: the VATEX dataset and the YouTube platform. The data in Vinoground is systematically categorized into three major categories: *object, action*, and *viewpoint*, along with four fine-grained subcategories: *interaction, cyclical, spatial*, and *contextual*. LMMs are tasked with distinguishing between a pair of counterfactual captions given a video (referred to as text scoring) or between a pair of counterfactual videos given a caption (referred to as video scoring). Empirical results show that current LMMs, including state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, still lag far behind human performance in understanding the temporal dynamics of short videos. They particularly struggle with recognizing fine-grained temporal differences, such as *interaction*, *spatial* (direction), and *cyclical* actions."

I have some doubts about the process of benchmark construction. Shouldn't we first obtain the video and then generate the counterfactual captions?\n\n- The author should provide more detailed classification criteria, such as whether human classification is used, to determine if there is overlap or similarity between action and viewpoint in video-caption pairs.\n\n- Why do some pairs belong to a multitude of these minor categories, while some do not belong to any of them? The minor categories in the benchmark include 350 videos, and I have doubts about the data volume. Due to the imbalance of categories and the reduced number of videos, is the benchmark capable of reasonably evaluating the capabilities of LLMs?\n\n- The author should improve the readability of the article, for example: \"For generative LMMs, we can only provide inputs (e.g., 2 captions and 1 video) to the model and ask it to output an answer A or B.\" Without reading the subsequent experimental setups, the reference to A and B here may lead to confusion.\n\n- The author should provide the video length distribution for each category of the benchmark to illustrate the generalizability of the method where \"we concatenate the positive and negative videos into a single video with a 2 second black screen in between.\" If there are too many short videos, it may result in a significant loss of evaluation data.\n\n- While the article establishes a strong human baseline, the author should provide information on the distribution of factors such as age, gender, educational background, etc., for the human participants. This information would impact the reliability of the human baseline.\n\n- Figures 3, 6, 7, and 8 have low resolution, affecting readability.\n\nI think that there are many unclear points in this paper, especially in the crucial sections on dataset construction and model evaluation, which can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nIf my concerns can be addressed, I will raise my rating."
