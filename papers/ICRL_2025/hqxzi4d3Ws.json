    "abstract": "Advancements in quantum computing have spurred significant interest in harnessing its potential for speedups over classical systems. However, noise remains a major obstacle to achieving reliable quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduce a provably noise-resilient training theory and algorithm to enhance the robustness of parameterized quantum circuits. Our method, with a natural connection to Evolutionary Strategies, guarantees resilience to parameter noise with minimal adjustments to commonly used optimization algorithms, as demonstrated in phase classification and state preparation tasks. Our approach is function-agnostic, adaptable to various quantum circuits, and capable of providing explainability insights into quantum models. By developing provably guaranteed learning theory with quantum circuits, our work opens new avenues for practical, robust applications of near-term quantum computers.",

The authors conduct experiments primarily focused on phase classification and state preparation tasks. However, these may not fully represent the diverse range of applications of parameterized quantum circuits (PQC).\n\n3. There is a lack of comparison to other methods. This can be improved by including experiments and discussion with quantum certified robustness methods as discussed in prior work, or even with standard quantum experiments using noise mitigation methods.\n\n4. There is a lack of detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. As one example, the authors mention two different variance regularizations but do not conduct any experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these regularizations. This omission leaves readers uncertain about the impact and optimal choice of these regularizations.\"\n\n5. Although the paper claims that their method provides insights into which parameters have larger robustness guarantees, it does not elaborate on how these insights can be practically utilized or interpreted by users. It would be beneficial to request specific examples from the authors that illustrate how these insights could be applied in practice. This would encourage them to provide more concrete information regarding the practical value of their method's interpretability.\n\n6.

The numerical results are relatively weak. Many experiment details are missing. What is PQC model used in the experiment? What is size of the PQC parameters? How many training data used? What is the additional computation cost when using the certified approach? \n6. In the phase classical problem, why to choose the initial state as the ground state? \n7.

The source of noise considered is one of the least detrimental ones in real quantum devices. Also, it is unclear how this paper is set apart from previous literature.\n\n2 The theoretical contributions in this submission are limited to laying out existing framework, minimally adapting a well-known training algorithm, listing a few metrics, and proof-of-principle experiments.\n\n3 The numerical experiments are not very convincing. First, the quantum systems studied are very small when compared to similar experiments in the literature in the last decade. Next, the trade-off between accuracy and robustness is barely recognizable in Figure 1, and completely absent in Figure 2, to the point that these plots are detrimental to the overall message of the paper. The rest of the plots (the comparison between area and semi-axis standard deviation) is very surprising, since when introducing the metrics, the authors already say \u201c[the standard deviation] is likely not of particular note for any use\u2026\u201d. Following the geometric picture elaborated in Section 3.2., it should be clear that the area of an ellipsoid is closely related to the variance of its semi-axes. So, on the one hand, it is unclear why practitioners should be interested in this second analysis, and on the other hand the results follow almost directly from analytical geometry.\n\n4 The choice of learning algorithm seems arbitrary. While it is true that evolutionary strategies have been used in the literature, it is unclear that they are preferable to gradient-based methods. The reference cited by the authors states that, in the worst-case, the complexity of evaluating gradients is linear in the complexity of evaluating the model times the number of parameters. Other references exist showing that this stops being true in specific cases of interest. And, even if it were true in general, evolutionary strategies are known to have much longer convergence times than gradient-based methods. The authors seem to ignore the fact that, even though computing each gradient iteration may take longer, this may be completely offset by the dramatically reduced number of iterations. This does not mean that focusing on evolutionary training algorithms is not well-justified, but the text is currently misleading in how uncommon an approach this is.\n\n5 The authors mention that the proposed tool of certified robustness can also be used for parameters that are not optimized for. This makes a lot of sense. This further seems to highlight that this study is a convoluted spin of the simple message \u201ctake random perturbations of increasing size until the performance starts decreasing, independently for each parameter, and then report the size of the largest acceptable perturbation\u201d. If this is accurate, this further highlights the lack of strength of the submission. If it is not accurate, it should be better clarified in the text."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Questions and comments:\nIn the prior work section, the authors explain that the techniques of certified robustness and training of parametrized quantum circuits have been previously addressed and carry intrinsic interest. Still, as a reader, it seems that the presented techniques are a direct application of a previously-developed formalism. If this is not the case, the authors should explicitly delineate what are the novelties in Section 3.\nThe submission would be much more convincing if the authors had produced a general-case statement that further justifies why using this framework produces desirable results. Along the same lines, in Section 4.2.1. the authors open with \u201cwe desire to understand the best [robustness-accuracy] trade-off we can achieve\u201d, and then proceed to perform limited numerical experiments, ignoring the question of best-possible trade-off.\nThe proposed approach is not compared to any other method. One would have expected to compare this \u201cquantum-specific\u201d tool to previously proposed \u201cclassical-general\u201d tools applied to these quantum models.\nThe link to interpretability is rather weak. On the one hand, practitioners are most-likely aware of the relative relevance of each of their parameters. On the other hand, if the variance in the certified-robust parameter distribution is to be seriously considered as an interpretability method, then it should be properly benchmarked against other methods in the literature. Since the authors mention that this certified robustness can be linked to the sensitivity of the parameters, why did the authors not compare their results to standard sensitivity analysis, like using the Hessian or the Fisher information matrix?\nIn section 3.2. the volume of a high-dimensional ellipse is proposed as a metric for robustness. It is a well-known fact that the volume of a high-dimensional sphere vanishes asymptotically in the dimension of the ambient-space, so why would a metric based on this vanishing quantity be advantageous? This metric is introduced here, although later in the experiments different quantities are used, more closely-related to the volume of a high-dimensional prism than that of an ellipse. As a reader I found it very confusing why this metric was introduced, instead of the ones used in the experiments.\nIn section 4.4., the authors mention the potential users of their method, but they do not clarify who those users would be. This is again in relation to the choice of noise model. If the users ought to be researchers running these algorithms on hardware, the types of noise they are likely to encounter are not the ones captured in this study. If the users ought to be researchers performing simulations of quantum machine learning algorithms, then the inclusion of parameter noise becomes again less relevant. Who do the authors exactly envision as users of this method?\n\nFeedback with the aim to improve the paper. These points are here to help, and not necessarily part of my decision assessment.\nAs a reader, several parts of the paper felt rushed and unpolished. The informal language in Sections 2. and 4.1. is distracting (subjective). There are a few grammar mistakes throughout the document. In Definition 3.2. the authors conclude with \u201cfor any noise perturbation delta from a certain distribution\u201d, which makes no logical sense: it can either be \u201cfor all perturbations from a given domain\u201d, or \u201cwith high probability over perturbations sampled from a given distribution\u201d. The smoothed classifier as defined is a random variable, and it is never addressed whether or how to turn this random variable into a deterministic labeling function. In Section 3.3. the authors say \u201cIn general, what ES typically\u2026\u201d, which is logically incorrect: \u201cin general\u201d and \u201ctypically\u201d are in contradiction. At the end of Section 3.4. the second regularization proposal ends with the inverse of sigma, where sigma is supposed to be a vector, so it is not clear what its inverse should be.\nThe authors invoke \u201cnoise resilience\u201d in the title of the submission, referring to the uncontrollable effects that keep current hardware from being full-fledged quantum computers. Indeed, developing noise-resilient algorithms is an important task until we reach fault-tolerant quantum computers. That being said, the authors consider a single source of errors, and actually one of the least detrimental in real quantum devices: noise in the parameters. I would recommend the authors to either choose a more specific title, or to convincingly argue why parameter noise is important at present (notice that the goal of the field is to build noiseless quantum computers, so studying noise models must be justified from the point of view of real obstacles to that end)."
