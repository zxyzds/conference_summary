    "title": "Adaptive Graduated Non-Convexity for Point Cloud Registration",
    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a critical and challenging task in computer vision. It is difficult to avoid poor local minima since the cost function is significantly non-convex. Correspondences tainted by significant or unknown outliers may cause the probability of finding a close-to-true transformation to drop rapidly, leading to point cloud registration failure. Many registration methods avoid local minima by updating the scale parameter of the cost function using graduated non-convexity (GNC). However, the update is usually performed in a fixed manner, resulting in limited accuracy and robustness of registration, and failure to reliably converge to the global minimum. Therefore, we present a novel method to robust point cloud registration based on Adaptive Graduated Non-Convexity (AGNC). By monitoring the positive definiteness of the Hessian of the cost function, the scale in graduated non-convexity is adaptively reduced without the need for a fixed optimization schedule. In addition, a multi-task knowledge sharing mechanism is used to achieve collaborative optimization of non-convex cost functions at different levels to further improve the success rate of point cloud registration under challenging high outlier conditions. Experimental results on simulated and real point cloud registration datasets show that AGNC far outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and accuracy, and can accurately obtain registration results even in the case of extreme 99\\% outlier rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores point cloud registration considering adaptive graduated non-convexity.",

A major contribution of this paper is that high outlier rates can also perform well. As for the evaluation of high outlier rate, only on the simulation data set, however, as shown in FIG. 4, the current methods can achieve good registration. This does not speak to the strengths of your approach. On the contrary, on 3DMatch dataset, with high outlier rate, it is difficult for existing methods to achieve robust registration. It is suggested to add the experimental results of Outlier rate=99% in 3DMatch dataset, which can make this paper more convincing. \"Accurate registration results are obtained even at the extreme 99% outlier rate.\" \"Is a bit of an exaggeration.\n\n2.Some  typos.\nWhat do we mean by ER and Et in Tables 3 and 4 and 5? Should it be RE and TE?"

In addition, 3DMatch uses FCGF and 3DLoMatch uses Predator for feature extraction, which is kind of intentional to show the reader better results.\n\n2. It is suggested that ablation experiments should also be done on the 3DMatch data set. Only the contribution to accuracy can be seen for the simulation data set, but not for the robustness, such as the index RR."

                "value": "This paper introduces an adaptive method for adjusting the scale of the cost function in graduated non-convexity (GNC) to address challenges related to convergence steps. However, there are several areas for improvement:\n\n1-While the paper presents experimental validation using a toy example to illustrate the effects of the adaptive scheme on convergence iterations, it lacks critical information on runtime and the computational overhead required for Hessian. Including runtime data in Table 1 would be beneficial, as it would provide a complete picture of performance by accounting for the overhead of Hessian computation and binary search.\n\n2-The paper contains many acronyms, such as FGCF and LSQ, without definitions. It is important to clarify these terms early on to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, several notations, like \"r\" in Equation 1, are introduced without explanation. These should be defined as soon as they are presented. Equations 6 through 11 also contain unexplained notations, which can confuse readers.\n\n3-The assertion that \u201c\u2026. H in Eq. 2 obtained at \u00b5_{k+1} is ensured to remain positive definite, then the new estimate z_{k+1} is guaranteed to be in the same convergence domain as the previous iteration\u201d requires citation or proof. Providing a reference would strengthen the validity of this claim.\n\n4-An insightful addition would be to include experiments assessing the impact of a multi-task knowledge-sharing mechanism with fixed scaling in Table 6, alongside the number of iterations and runtime required for convergence. Currently, the errors without knowledge sharing are worse than those of the fixed scaling scheme, raising questions about whether the adaptive scale adjustment primarily enhances convergence speed rather than accuracy. Adding columns to compare knowledge sharing in fixed scaling settings and the number of convergence stages would clarify the contributions of each component.\n\n5-I recommend visualizing the outputs from competitive methods in Figure 4 and using bright colours to enhance clarity in the visualizations (minor)\n\n6-In Tables 3 and 4, it is unclear if \"ER\" and \"Et\" refer to rotation error and translation error, respectively. If so, for consistency with the previous definitions, they should be labelled as \"RE\" and \"TE\" as mentioned in line 344.\n\n7-I am not convinced of the accurate performance of this method, as the criteria for successful registration (line 431) in Tables 3 and 4 seem too lenient for both indoor and object-level settings. Similar concerns also arise for Table 5.\n\nPlease correct the spelling of \"black-Rangarajan\" duality. It would also be beneficial to include a brief sentence explaining what this duality is about for the reader\u2019s clarity.\nIn line 305, please change the reference from \"(line 4)\" to \"(line 5)\""

How would these compare in terms of performance and convergence speed?\n2-The paper states that \"little attention has been paid to how the scaling factor is determined.\" Please provide references to existing techniques that address this issue. Including comparisons to these methods would enhance the context of this work.\n3- Once the Hessian is computed, how valuable is its inclusion in the cost function? I would expect this to lead to faster convergence with minimal overhead. Can authors provide insights on this aspect?\n4-How valid is it to consider different optimization stages as different tasks? Could authors elaborate on this concept and its implications for the proposed method?\n5-How is the final value of \\mu_{final}determined? \n6-Could authors add extra columns in Tables 3 and 4 to indicate the range of initial total translation and rotation offsets? The translation errors of greater than 6 cm and 9 cm for even the best performances seem unacceptable for practical applications in small indoor settings."

The experiments on Indoor Scenes may be insufficient, as this is the main field that registration methods focus on. I would suggest adding different descriptors on both 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch, those descriptors should cover a wide range of outlier rates. (as on synthetic data, the test covering different outlier rates is included, but on real data, there is no such setting) Moreover, using FCGF descriptors on 3DMatch but Predator on 3DLoMatch is weird. It looks like that FCGF doesn't perform well on 3DLoMatch, which leads to bad results for the proposed method. The authors have to choose another descriptors for 3DLoMatch.\n\n3. More  visualization results on indoor and outdoor scenes are encouraged. And it is also better to directly visualize the correspondences before and after using the proposed method.\n\n4.
