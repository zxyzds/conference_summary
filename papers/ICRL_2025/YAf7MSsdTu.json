    "title": "Local-Global Shortest Path Algorithms on Random Graphs, Enhanced with GNNs",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) using local message passing were recently shown to inherit the intrinsic limitations of local algorithms in solving combinatorial graph optimization problems such as finding shortest distances (Loukas, 2020). To address this issue, Awasthi et al. (2022) proposed architectures based on Bourgain\u2019s (1985) seminal work on Hilbert space embeddings. These architectures enhance local message passing in GNNs with a single global computation, yielding a local-global algorithm. This paper focuses on the average-case analysis of more general local-global algorithms for finding shortest distances (of which GNN+ is a particular case). Our primary contribution is a theoretical analysis of these algorithms on Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graphs. We prove that, on random graphs, these algorithms have lower distortion of shortest distances for most pairs of vertices w.h.p. while requiring a lower embedding dimension. Inspired by Awasthi et al. (2022), and to automate local computations and improve computational efficiency in practical scenarios, we further propose a modification to these algorithms that incorporates GNNs in the local computation phase. Empirical results on ER graphs and benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the enhanced performance of the GNN-augmented algorithm over the traditional approach.",

                "value": "This paper analyzes hybrid algorithms that combine local and global approaches to solve shortest path problems on graphs, especially focusing on Erdo\u030bs-R\u00e9nyi random graphs. By adding Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into the local phase, the algorithm becomes faster and more scalable for big graph networks. Through theoretical analysis on Erdo\u030bs-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, the authors show that their method provides tight distance estimates for most node pairs. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs highlight the improved performance of the GNN-enhanced approach."

The main contribution of this paper lies in the analysis of lower and upper bound distortions on Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs.\n\n**Quality**\n\nI have concerns about the proposed method, as it appears to be effective only on small graphs, even when computing approximate distances. This limitation raises questions about its scalability and practical applicability to larger networks.\n\n**Clarity**\n\nThe presentation could benefit from improvements in several areas. For instance, the research problem (tackling the shortest-path distance problem using machine learning) lacks clear motivation. The transferability of the GNN from small graphs to large graphs is not adequately justified. The experiments are limited, and the results are not thoroughly explained.\n\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe paper overlooks a substantial body of literature (e.g., [1,2,3,4]) on fast and scalable shortest-path algorithms that can compute exact shortest-path distances on large networks (with millions or even billions of nodes) within milliseconds per query, and in some cases, even microseconds for specific network types like road networks. Given these existing solutions, the significance of this work is questionable.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Fast Exact Shortest-Path Distance Queries on Large Networks by Pruned Landmark Labeling, Akiba et al.

                "value": "W1: The research problem may need to be revisited or reconsidered. The authors argue that \u201cmodern networks often consist of billions of nodes, and global algorithms take hours to be implemented, whereas approximate solutions are typically needed with ultra-low latency.\u201d However, this claim lacks citations or sources of information. Can the authors provide specific citations supporting the claim about computational challenges on very large networks? In recent literature on shortest-path distance algorithms, for complex networks with billions of nodes, it often takes only a couple of hours to build an index, with exact shortest-path distance queries completing in under one microsecond [1].  To better justify the need for an approximate method, I would suggest a comparison with existing efficient exact algorithms. \n\n\nW2: The proposed method is primarily analyzed and evaluated based on Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graphs. However, it is well known that shortest-path distance problems on different graph structures may require different algorithmic designs. For instance, road networks typically have low node degrees, while social networks often have a dense core, leading to significantly different design choices. Therefore, the results on ER random graphs have limited applicability in practice.\n\nW3: The design of the GNN appears to follow the basic principles of message passing within a local neighborhood. However, it is unclear how long-distances would be managed if the GNN depth is small. Conversely, increasing the GNN depth could lead to the oversmoothing problem. Also, since the shortest-path distance problem is to calculate the number of edges in the shortest path between two vertices, it is unclear how the node features contribute meaningfully in this context. Providing examples or intuitive explanations would help clarify this aspect. Finally, the rationale behind the transferability of the model is not well-justified in this setting and would benefit from further clarification.\n\nW4: The experiments do not align with the stated motivation of the work, which criticizes traditional approaches for the high computational cost of shortest-path calculations. Most experiments are conducted on Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi graphs with sizes ranging from just 25 nodes to 3200 nodes, which fails to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method on large networks. In Figure 2, even on a small graph with 50 nodes, the GNN performs poorly in predicting distances when the distances are larger, which raises concerns about its effectiveness. In Figures 4(b)\u2013(c), why the MSE of BFS remains flat as n increases from 25 to 3200, whereas in Figure 3, the MSE of BFS increases with n? \n\nThere are various real-world graphs and networks commonly used by researchers to benchmark shortest-path distance algorithms (e.g., [1,2,3,4]), such as road networks with sizes up to 24 million nodes and complex networks (including social networks) ranging from 1 million to 2 billion nodes. However, the paper only benchmarks on small ER graphs and two small real world social networks against the BFS algorithm. It would be more informative to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art shortest-path algorithms on these larger, real-world datasets to better assess its effectiveness and scalability."
