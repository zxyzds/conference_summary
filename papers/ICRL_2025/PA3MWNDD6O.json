    "title": "Decentralized Blockchain-based Robust Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandit",
    "abstract": "We study a robust, i.e. in presence of malicious participants, multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem where multiple participants are distributed on a fully decentralized blockchain, with the possibility of some being malicious. The rewards of arms are homogeneous among the honest participants, following time-invariant stochastic distributions, which are revealed to the participants only when certain conditions are met to ensure that the coordination mechanism is secure enough. The coordination mechanism's objective is to efficiently ensure the cumulative rewards gained by the honest participants are maximized. To this end and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate advanced techniques from blockchains, as well as novel mechanisms, into such a cooperative decision making framework to design optimal strategies for honest participants. This framework allows various malicious behaviors and the maintenance of security and participant privacy. More specifically, we select a pool of validators who communicate to all participants, design a new consensus mechanism based on digital signatures for these validators, invent a UCB-based strategy that requires less information from participants through secure multi-party computation, and design the chain-participant interaction and an incentive mechanism to encourage participants' participation. Notably, we are the first to prove the theoretical regret of the proposed algorithm and claim its optimality. Unlike existing work that integrates blockchains with learning problems such as federated learning which mainly focuses on  optimality via computational experiments, we demonstrate that the regret of honest participants is upper bounded by $\\log{T}$ under certain assumptions. The regret bound is consistent with the multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem without malicious participants and the robust multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with purely Byzantine attacks which do not affect the entire system.",

This information is particularly important given that the proposed framework relies on the assumptions about the structure of malicious behaviors as stated by the authors.\n- As a result of the previous two points, the practicality and implications of the proposed framework are not clear.\n- Missing citations throughout the paper:\n\tLines 164-165: standard notations for traditional MAB and multi-agent MAB\n\tLine 224: \"... existing work on Byzantine-resilient multi-agent MAB\"\n\tLine 230: \"This assumption is quite common in blockchain works.\""

                "value": "- Regarding its readability, the paper needs to be significantly streamlined. For instance, the paper spends 2.5 pages on various topics and only lines 151-158 to describe its contributions. I found it very hard to read and understand. Also, I think that paper ends abruptly at the page limit and then simply continues in the appendix (the conclusions are in page 15). Other examples include the caption of Figure 1 which almost overlaps with the text and the storm of references (especially in the first part) which don't really provide a context for the paper but rather confuse the reader.\n- Regarding its rigor, there seem to be undefined abbreviations (e.g., UCB), redundant notations, and questionable assumptions, e.g., in line 169 why is B=T and how can we assume that the number of blocks is fixed (and not growing) and each block is valid with some probability? This is an uncommon representation of a blockchain (history). Other examples include Theorem 1 which mentions \"existential forgery, and universal composability\" but which are only defined much later in the appendix (same for the other theorems). This significantly interrupts the flow.\n- The paper mingles several notions, federated learning, blockchains, multi-arm bandits, multi-agent learning etc and to allow for a reasonable assessment, it needs to make a stronger effort to both clarify this combination and to draw clear connections to existing literature and existing real-world (or at least theoretical) problems.\n- After reading the problem formulation a couple of times, I still struggle to understand what is the context: what are multi-agent MABs on blockchains? Is there a practical scenario that this setting captures?"

Can the authors provide simulations on synthetic or real-data to demonstrate this?\n- What is/are the closest related paper/s? In particular, at the end of the abstract, there seem to be references to existing work with logT regret in similar (but less adversarial) settings. Can the authors elaborate on these comparisons (with concrete references)?\n- Why is the purpose of the proposed algorithm? What is its computational complexity and is it centralised or decentralised?\n- What do the arms stand for in this scenario and what is the utility that the centralised mechanism is trying to optimise for the honest participants? \n- Is this applicable to any blockchain or specifically the Ethereum blockchain (which runs with validators)?"

For example, in section 3, the author states a lengthy method, but does not provide intuition or insight, making it easy for people to get lost in the details and not understand what the sub-technique is used for.\n2. No numerical results. This paper has no numerical results at all, making it difficult to intuitively assess the effectiveness of the BC-UCB algorithm. In fact, there are a series of works considering the robustness of the algorithms against Byzantine attacks. The authors can consider using them as baselines for experiments."

The difficulty of the problem is unclear, thus the efficiency of the algorithm cannot be evaluated reasonably.\n* Can the authors compare their results with other Byzantine-robust algorithms, both theoretically and numerically? I am concerned that the introduction of blockchain (although the authors claim that the problems like privacy can be solved meanwhile) may increase the complexity of the problem. If the improvement in regret is not significant enough, then this technology may be difficult to apply."
