    "abstract": "Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are fundamental and intricate processes essential for the advancement of drug discovery and design. We present a groundbreaking unified framework for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction that seamlessly integrates advanced concepts from non-commutative geometry, optimal transport theory, and quantum information science. Our approach, Non-Commutative Geometric Adaptation for Molecular Interactions (NCGAMI), reframes the DTI prediction problem within the context of a non-commutative pharmacological manifold, enabling a profound synthesis of classical and quantum perspectives. By leveraging the spectral action principle, we develop a novel domain adaptation technique that minimizes a geometrically motivated functional, yielding optimal transport maps between pharmacological domains. We establish a deep connection between our framework and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through a fluctuation theorem for domain adaptation, providing fundamental insights into the thermodynamics of the adaptation process. Our unified variational objective, formulated using geometric quantization, incorporates quantum relative entropy and Liouville volume forms, bridging information-theoretic and geometric aspects of the problem. We introduce a quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm for solving this objective, guaranteeing convergence to the optimal solution under specified conditions. Furthermore, we prove that the algebra of observables generated by our model forms a hyperfinite type III$_1$ factor, revealing a profound link between the algebraic structure of DTI prediction and the geometry of optimal transport. This result enables us to characterize the modular automorphism group governing the evolution of adapted distributions. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that NCGAMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of DTI prediction tasks, achieving unprecedented accuracy and robustness.",

                "value": "### W1. Unkind manuscript for general audience\n\n**W1-1. Lack of information about preliminaries**\n\nAs a researcher in protein-ligand interaction domain, I strongly believe that the terms like cohomology and time-dependent Hamiltonian may be difficult to understand in general for the readers for this field. However, the manuscript does not provide any references to start with nor introductory explanation of these concepts. This will limit the impact of the work, regardless of the novelty and strength of the work.\n\n**W1-2. Lack of information about related works**\n\nAs far as I understand, the main topic of the manuscript is development of theoretical framework on unsupervised domain adaptation, but the related works on UDA or its theory are not provided. Since related works inform about baseline models or theory, lack of related works in this part also limit the impact of the work, regardless of the novelty and strength of the work.\n\n**W1-3. Lack of detailed proofs**\n\nThe authors proposed several theorems and corresponding proofs. However, almost *every proof is explained with sequential steps, which are still not very trivial*. For example, the second step of the proof of theorem 3.4, the authors stated that \"Verify the conditions for consistency of M-estimators in the presence of nuisance parameters (transport map)\". However, this seems not trivial. If page limit matters, the detailed proofs for each theorem can be provided in the appendix.\n\n**W1-4. Lack of reference**\n\nFor several proofs and texts, there's no reference provided. For example, in the third step in the proof of theorem 3.4, Huber-Donsker-Varadhan theorem should be cited properly. (I couldn't find the proper citation for this) There are more cases (not all) that needs reference:\n- Jarynski equality[1]\n- Crooks fluctuation theorem [2]\n- Tomita-Takesaki modular theory [3,4]\n- see Q4 (About limitations of current works in introduction)\n\n### W2. Unclear explanation for applying theory in practical application\n\nAlthough practical application of proposed framework based on theory is not very trivial, authors do not provide any explanation for implementation. For example, the term \"UDA implicit data augmentation\" is shown first-time and last-time in the ablation study (section 6.4). The authors **should** clarify the detailed implementation steps in the manuscript.\n\n### W3. Not well-represented results (see Q2)\n**W3-1. Results do not seems to demonstrate the effectiveness of theory in terms of UDA and DTI**\n\n1. **Performance evaluation in terms of UDA**: Since the main idea of this work is UDA framework for DTI, to demonstrate the effectiveness of *theoretical framework itself*, authors should compare their framework with other UDA frameworks, while applying them to DTI. If this is not possible, the reason for this should be clearly explained.\n2. **Performance evaluation in terms of DTI**: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory in DTI, it is essential to show that it outperforms existing methods on this task. The results do not exhibit significant performance improvements over other classification models, which raises concerns about the theory\u2019s effectiveness. Additionally, the manuscript lacks an analysis of the underlying reasons for the observed lower performance compared to baseline models, further questioning the robustness of the theoretical contributions. Moreover, presenting the comparative performance metrics in a table format rather than a graph would allow for more intuitive and straightforward comparisons across different models.\n\n**W3-2. Lack of comparison with other methods or more datasets**\n\nCurrently, results in the manuscript, comparing with DTI models, is not very comprehensive in two aspects: baseline models and datasets.\n1. **Baseline models:** The benchmark should be done with more recent models[5,6,7], that outperform currently compared baselines. If there's any reason that cannot benchmark explicitly with those models, the authors should explicitly note them.\n2. **Datasets:** To better demonstrate the robustness of proposed framework, the authors may consider benchmarking along more dataset, such as BindingDB[8], BioSNAP[9].\n\n## References\n[1] Jarzynski, Christopher. \"Nonequilibrium equality for free energy differences.\" Physical Review Letters 78.14 (1997): 2690.\n\n[2] Crooks, Gavin E. \"Entropy production fluctuation theorem and the nonequilibrium work relation for free energy differences.\" Physical Review E 60.3 (1999): 2721.\n\n[3] Takesaki, Masamichi.

                "value": "**Q1. Applicability of UDA Framework Beyond Drug-Target Interaction**\n\nIn my opinion, the proposed method, which presents theoretical framework of UDA, can be applied in various domain since the concept of *pharmacological* sheaf (and the other definitions about pharmacophores) can also be applied in other domain as *domain-specific* sheaf. Image and graph domain already have many literatures.[1] Is there any reason that authors applied the proposed method specifically for drug-target interaction domain?\n\n### Q2. Questions about results\n**Q2-1. Baseline Training Details and Fairness of Comparisons**\n\nAbout experimental settings for baselines, how did authors trained baseline models to compare with the model trained with NCGAMI? The baseline models do not use UDA frameworks, and if they are only trained on source data, it is not fair comparison. Please clarify how the baseline models are trained.\n\n**Q2-2. Demonstrate Domain Adaptation to Data-Deficient Protein Families**\n\nFor the practical aspect, I've imagine applying UDA for data-deficient area in protein-ligand interaction, such as relatively small protein family. \nIf the authors can show the proposed framework's domain transfer in terms of training source data in GPCR(large, relatively data-sufficient protein family) and applying it more smaller data-deficient protein family will show NCGAMI's effectiveness better.\n\n**Q2-3. Appropriateness of Random Dataset Splitting for Domain Adaptation**\n\nIs random splitting of dataset is suitable to prove the performance of domain adaptation? In my opinion, simply using random splitting may lead to the same probability measures $\\mathcal{P}_s=\\mathcal{P}_t$, which directly contrasts the fundamental assumption of domain adaptation problem $\\mathcal{P}_s\\ne\\mathcal{P}_t$, as introduced in section 3.\n\n**Q3.\u00a0Concept Figure**\n\nThe concept figure does not effectively illustrate the proposed framework. Instead of detailing the specifics of NCGAMI, the figure appears to represent a generic neural network architecture for DTI prediction, thereby omitting the UDA component. Additionally, the abbreviation \u201cSSM\u201d is unclear\u2014does it stand for state-space model? The manuscript should ensure that all abbreviations are defined and that the concept figure accurately reflects all key components of the proposed framework, including the UDA.\n\n\u00a0**Q4. References in Introduction**\n\nIn the second paragraph of introduction, is there any reference for the following? \"These limitations become particularly apparent when attempting to model the quantum mechanical aspects of molecular interactions or when dealing with the high-dimensional, non-Euclidean spaces characteristic of chemical compound libraries and protein structures.\"\n\n**Q5. Consistency between Objective and Hamiltonian**\n\nIn Theorem 4.3, the authors aim to preserve important domain-invariant features, which sounds good.\nHowever, there appears to be a potential inconsistency regarding the treatment of the overall objective $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{unified}$.\nAs I understand, the objective is intended to be minimized during training.\n\nConcurrently, the manuscript associates $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{unified}$ with the Hamiltonian $H$.\nIn classical Hamiltonian dynamics, $H$ is conserved over time, meaning it remains constant and is not subject to minimization.\n\nThis raises the question: *How do the authors reconcile the minimization of $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{unified}$ with the conservation properties of a Hamiltonian system?* If $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{unified}$ serves as the Hamiltonian, minimizing it would contradict the inherent property of $H$ being conserved. Clarification on this point would enhance the theoretical coherence of the manuscript.\n\n**Q6. Ablation study**\n\nIs there any reason for conducting ablation study on model architectures, even though it is not mentioned in the manuscript?\n\n**Q7. (Very minor, just out of curiosity)**\n\nWhy did the authors select *lifelong learning* in the primary area?\n\n## References\n[1] Liu, Xiaofeng, et al. \"Deep unsupervised domain adaptation: A review of recent advances and perspectives.\" APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing 11.1 (2022)."
