    "title": "InstaTrain: Adaptive Training via Ultra-Fast Natural Annealing within Dynamical Systems",
    "abstract": "Time-series modeling is broadly adopted to capture underlying patterns and trends present in historical data, allowing for prediction of future values. However, one crucial aspect in such modeling is often overlooked: in highly dynamic environments, data distributions can shift drastically within a second or less. Under this circumstance, traditional predictive models, even online learning methods struggle to adapt to the ultra-fast and complex distribution shift present in highly dynamic scenarios. To address this, we propose InstaTrain, a novel learning paradigm that enables frequent model updates with microsecond-level intervals for real-world prediction tasks, allowing it to keep pace with rapidly evolving data distributions. In this work, (1) We transform the slow and expensive model training process into an ultra-fast natural annealing process that can be carried out on a dynamical system. (2) Leveraging a recently proposed electronic dynamical system, we augment the system with a parameter update module, extending its capabilities to encompass both rapid training and inference. Experimental results across highly dynamic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers on average, a remarkable 4,135$\\times$ training speedup, $10^5\\times$ reduction in training energy costs, and 69.1\\% / 45.8\\% lower test MAE over the best result of SOTA methods running on GPUs with / without the online learning mechanism.",

It first formulates the time series prediction problem via the natural annealing procedure of a dynamical system, enabling performing efficient prediction.

It then leverages the natural annealing process of a dynamical system to enable ultra-fast model training. Furthermore, it redesigns the electronic dynamical system from a hardware aspect, enabling the self-training feature. The reviewer enjoys reading the paper, especially section 3.\n* The manuscript considers three types of baselines, covering 7 methods. It also uses an FEA software simulator to measure the accuracy and latency of the proposed method. Numerical results show that InstaTrain can achieve a significant speedup over all baseline models, while maintaining a $10^5$ reduction in energy consumption."

The proposed approach operates through Iterative Natural Annealing-based Training (INAT), which performs training directly on an electronic dynamical system rather than on conventional processors. The key innovation lies in extending existing electronic dynamical system hardware from inference-only to support both training and inference on the same hardware. The authors claim significant improvements in training speed, energy efficiency, and prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly for time-series prediction tasks with rapidly evolving data distributions."

There is no discussion of scalability to larger, more complex datasets. How would the system perform on higher-dimensional data or more complex tasks? Are there theoretical or practical limitations?\n\n2. The experimental results of the proposed IntraTrain approach are based on CUDA-based software simulator rather than actual hardware implementation. Although the author claimed that the real hardware has been manufactured in the reproducibility part.\n\n3. In Table 1, the power consumption of InstaTrain (950mW) is actually higher than baseline BRIM (250mW) and NP-GL (260mW), could you provide detailed calculations for the claimed energy reduction?\n\n4. The paper compares performance with \"not achievable\" baseline results for high-frequency scenarios. Could you explain the methodology behind these comparisons since they are \"not achievable\"?\n\nI'd be happy to raise the score if the author could address my concerns."

Traditional models, including online learning approaches, struggle to adapt quickly enough to such rapid changes. The authors transform the typically slow training process into an ultra-fast \"natural annealing\" process implemented on an electronic dynamical system. Their key contribution is twofold: they develop a new training algorithm called Iterative Natural Annealing based Training (INAT) that reformulates model training as an energy minimization problem, and they augment existing electronic hardware with parameter update modules to enable both training and inference on the same system. Evaluated on three high-frequency datasets including stock market and chemical sensor data, InstaTrain achieves dramatic improvements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating orders of magnitude faster training and inference speeds, significantly lower energy consumption, and better prediction accuracy. The work effectively bridges physics-inspired computing with machine learning to address the challenge of rapid distribution shifts in real-world applications."

The work effectively removes the speed limitations that have constrained previous approaches to dynamic model adaptation.\nQuality: The technical work is rigorous, with thorough mathematical foundations and experimental validation. The evaluation compares against multiple baselines across several high-frequency datasets, demonstrating improvements in speed, energy efficiency, and accuracy. The inclusion of ablation studies further strengthens the empirical results.\nClarity: The paper effectively communicates complex concepts through clear writing.\nSignificance: The work has substantial practical impact by enabling model adaptation at previously impossible speeds while reducing energy costs by orders of magnitude.
