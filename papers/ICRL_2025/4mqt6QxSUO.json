    "title": "A Unified Riemannian-Geometric Framework for SARS-CoV-2 Detection from CT Scans",
    "abstract": "We present a novel, theoretically grounded framework for automated SARS-CoV-2 detection from pulmonary Computed Tomography (CT) scans, integrating cutting-edge concepts from statistical learning theory, optimal transport, and information geometry. Our approach begins with a submodular optimization-based image selection protocol, utilizing a continuous greedy algorithm. The feature extraction process employs a Riemannian geometry-inspired attention mechanism, where feature integration is formulated as geodesic interpolation on a manifold induced by the Fisher Information Metric. We introduce a unified decision-making framework based on proper scoring rules and Bregman divergences, encompassing multiple voting schemes with proven consistency and asymptotic normality properties. To address domain shift, we develop an adversarial domain adaptation technique using the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance, complemented by a graph-based regularization term derived from Gromov-Wasserstein theory. Theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for the adversarial training process and establishes generalization bounds in terms of optimal transport distances. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. This work not only advances the field of automated medical image analysis but also contributes fundamental theoretical insights to the broader domains of machine learning and optimal transport theory.",

                "value": "1. There exists so many  ''Meaningless Equations''. Several equations (such as Equation 4 involving the Fisher Information Metric and Equation 6 on geodesic interpolation) are overly complex and seem disconnected from the practical task of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Using these equations does not provide any clear advantage or insight into improving the detection process. Can author provide a figure that is able to show the connection among those equations and modules. Also, more experiments should be added in this paper to show how they improve the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 detection.\n\n2. Except for Weakness 1, this paper also makes overcomplication. The decision-making framework based on Bregman divergences and multiple voting schemes (Equations 10\u201316) adds unnecessary layers of complexity. These methods do not appear to address the practical challenges in SARS-CoV-2 detection, and their benefits are not empirically validated. Furthermore, I consider this framework can not only serve only one task, for other tasks this framework should be work. The experimental results only present on SARS-CoV-2 detection, which have achieved high accuracy by other methods, thus weaken this paper. \n\n3. What's the motivation? The paper fails to adequately explain why the complex mathematical tools used are necessary for solving the specific problem of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The connection between the mathematical framework and the medical imaging task is tenuous at best. I really confuse about the paper's objectives. There is not figure or any description that can bulid a strong connection between the proposed framework and SARS-CoV-2 detection. \n\n4. While the paper is mathematically dense, it lacks solid empirical results that justify the introduction of complex theoretical models. There is no clear demonstration that the advanced mathematical constructs (such as geodesic-based feature integration) outperform simpler approaches commonly used in medical image classification. More experimental result that related to other datasets/tasks should be added and discussed.\n\n5. The poor experiment. The presented experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing techniques. The improvements shown are marginal and do not seem to justify the additional mathematical complexity introduced by the paper."
