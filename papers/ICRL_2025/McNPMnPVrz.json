    "abstract": "Coarse-grained (CG) force field methods for molecular systems are a crucial tool to simulate large biological macromolecules and are therefore essential for characterisations of biomolecular systems. While state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based models for all-atom force fields have improved immensely over recent years, we observe and analyse significant limitations of the currently available approaches for DL-based CG simulations. In this work, we present a transferable DL-based CG force field approach applicable to a wide range of biosystems. To achieve this, our CG algorithm does not rely on hard-coded rules and is tuned to output coarse-grained systems optimised for minimal statistical noise in the ground truth CG forces, which results in significant improvement of model training. The force field model is based on the MACE architecture and is trained on a custom dataset created by a new approach based on the fragmentation of large biosystems covering protein, RNA and lipid chemistry. We demonstrate that our model can be applied in molecular dynamics simulations to obtain stable and qualitatively accurate trajectories for a variety of systems, while also discussing cases for which we observe limited reliability.",

                "value": "The authors describe the key innovations as extending a cited work (Webb et al) as the specific coarse-grained mapping, and the use of MACE potentials. It is very surprising that they do not provide any qualitative or quantitative comparisons with that work to show that either the updated (tuned) strategy or the use of MACE potentials significantly improves the performance on either the original benchmarks in Webb et al, or in the case studies in this work. The only ablations here appear to be for the 'tuned' vs 'untuned' models.\n\nA key contribution of this work is the use of MACE potentials. As the authors state on Page 2 \"Furthermore, previous CG-MLFF approaches have been relying on the invariant SchNet architecture for the force field model, which for all-atom force fields has been mostly replaced by other (typically equivariant) architectures in recent studies, for example, MACE (Batatia et al., 2022b), VisNet (Wang et al., 2022), or Allegro (Musaelian et al., 2023).\" However, some recent works have already considered models beyond SchNet, such as Allegro (Loose, Both et al. JPC-B 2023) or FLARE (Dushatko, Kozinsky et al. npj Comp Materials 2024). A comparison to these existing strategies should be included to show the improvement on this work over prior literature. \n\nThe accuracy of a coarse-grained potential requires more validation than a simple qualitative check compared to the all-atom potential. This is especially the case when comparing for fixed time windows, as the equivalent timescales in coarse grained potentials are typically much longer than the timestep would suggest. Thermodynamic consistency, accuracy of averaged functions like the RDF or radius of gyration or other observables would be a much better check. Also see the Opinion (Durumeric, Clementi et al, Opinion in Structural Biology, 2023) for a nice overview of the important considerations and specifically Figure 3 which highlights quantitative agreement for an all-atom and coarse grained potential. \n\nReproducibility: The code for the coarse-graining implementation does not appear to be available (or if it is already present in MACE-JAX, that is not clear from the text). Thus it might be difficult to reproduce or understand the details of the implementation."

Ablations are needed to show the improvements of MACE vs SchNet and original (Webb et al) vs the CG implementation here would be very helpful. Alternatively, quantitative comparisons between this work and prior work would also establish the improvements in this work. \n\n3. The authors should clarify the novelty of their work compared to prior work using potentials like Allegro (Voth et al, see citation above) or FLARE (Kozinsky et al, see citation above) and show quantitative comparisons with these prior works. This is especially the case since those prior works demonstrated quantitative agreement between all-atom and coarse grained observables for the simulations of interest."

If the tuning was based on MLFF-predicted forces, it would be valuable to consider tuning with DFT-aggregated forces as well. Although the differences between the **Tuning** CG and standard CG with no machine learned force filed might be slight, DFT-based tuning could yield marginal improvements with respect to the primary loss function. However, it is unclear if this approach, in comparison to the original CG method, significantly enhances generalization or universal applicability, as suggested by the authors. This raises questions about the method\u2019s novelty and practical impact, especially if it does not introduce substantial improvements over existing approaches.\n2. **Limited and Insufficient Metrics**: The study's metrics are simplistic and may not support robust conclusions about the model\u2019s generalizability or real-world applicability. For instance, the stability measure, assessed via temperature, provides only intermediate insights. A more comprehensive evaluation could follow metrics like those in [1], which evaluate atom-level stability and bond accuracy to better capture molecular coherence in 3D molecular generation. Moreover, the authors should compare their CG model to standard coarse-grained force fields, such as Martini, rather than only to their trained baseline. Additional limitations include the use of only one system each for RMSD and energy landscape evaluations, with no stable RMSD data for differentiating conformational states, where the author just quoted \u201cVisual\ninspection of the trajectory hints at the fact that the side chains of the two more distant amino acids\nmove further away from each other in this conformation\u201d but not shown in the figure. Furthermore, the CG model's energy landscape lacks overlap in low-energy modes with the reference, suggesting a poor representation of molecular dynamics. A more rigorous evaluation design, as demonstrated in [2], would strengthen the validation of CG model performance.\n3. **Minimal Contribution to the Machine Learning Community**: The paper\u2019s contribution to ML is limited, as it does not address core ML topics such as optimization, representation learning, or generative modelling. Nor does it apply ML techniques innovatively to scientific problems, as seen in works like [3] and [4]. Instead, the study mainly adopts a prior CG approach with minimal innovation in priority calculation and applies the MACE model for CG force learning. This limited novelty and applicability may reduce the work\u2019s relevance to the broader ML community.\n\n**References:**\n\n- [1] Hoogeboom, Emiel, et al. \"Equivariant diffusion for molecule generation in 3d.\" *International Conference on Machine Learning.* PMLR, 2022.\n- [2] Charron, Nicholas E., et al. \u201cNavigating protein landscapes with a machine-learned transferable coarse-grained model.\u201d *Nature Communications*, 2023.\n- [3] Li, Shaoning, et al. \"F $^ 3$ low: Frame-to-Frame Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics with SE (3) Guided Flow Matching.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.00751,* 2024.\n- [4] Arts, Marloes, et al. \"Two for one: Diffusion models and force fields for coarse-grained molecular dynamics.\" *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation* 19.18 (2023): 6151-6159."

For stability assessment, could the authors consider more comprehensive indicators beyond temperature alone? For example, studies like [1] (Hoogeboom et al., 2022) use atom-level stability and bond-type accuracy, which might provide additional insights into molecular coherence and CG model reliability.\n\n3. Additionally, including a comparison to a well-established CG force field, such as Martini, might provide a useful reference point for assessing performance.\n\n4. The RMSD and energy landscape analyses are insightful. Would the authors consider expanding these analyses to more than one system? Multiple systems could reinforce the stability and generalizability of the model across different molecular configurations.\n\n5. In the energy landscape analysis, there seems to be limited overlap in low-energy modes between the CG model and the reference. Could the authors share their perspective on this outcome and any potential implications for MD applications?\n\n6. The paper makes good strides in applying MACE to CG molecular dynamics. Could the authors further clarify how this work fits into broader ML themes, such as optimization or representation learning?

The priorities are assigned based on the first eigenvector of the Laplacian. The current paper proposes to use not just the Laplacian matrix but instead constructs weighted Laplacians with the same edges but weighted by three different features, resulting in four separate Laplacian matrices. The priorities are then calculated as a linear combination of the four first eigenvectors of the four matrices. The weights in the linear combination are found by optimizing an objective that is easy to calculate. The authors claim that this extension leads to a universally applicable method due to the higher degree of flexibility compared to the baseline. They support this by showing that their method leads to better training and qualitatively correct behaviours on their tested systems. To test their method, the authors also introduce a new dataset with large molecules designed to better test coarse-graining methods over a variety of systems."

Therefore, I think the authors are tackling a significant open problem with their work.

However, I don't see where the inductive bias comes in. The eigenvector of the Laplacian of a molecular graph isn't a physically meaningful concept, as far as I know. \n\nEquation 5 is central to the paper, and an intuitive explanation would be great if possible.\n\nWhat is the intuition for the three introduced weights? Why do we expect these to be meaningful, and couldn't other ones also be helpful? Since this is the central contribution of the work, a discussion of these aspects is necessary. \n\nThe 1/R_ij features change over time and, therefore, can shuffle the priorities, leading to different coarse-grainings for different time steps. Wouldn't this induce unsmooth behaviour in the simulation? If I understand this correctly, since the original work uses only chemical bonds, this wouldn't be the case for the original work unless there is bond breaking.\n\nIn line 296: Is the element composition really the number of elements? Could this lead to cases where a lot of elements of the same type are coarse-grained, leading to a large input number, something that is known to make neural networks unstable?\n\nLine 340: how can you just use 100 fragments?

It would be better to replace them with more helpful metrics. For example, if you can visually make out different conformers in the ground truth simulation, why not coarse-grain them with the different methods and then calculate the distance between the model's trajectories and these coarse-grained ground truth conformers? This would make it much easier to see if the different models found the same conformers. It doesn't have to be precisely this metric, but anything more informative would be great."
