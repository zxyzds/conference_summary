    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their task-agnostic capabilities, visual generation tasks such as image translation, style transfer, and character customization still rely heavily on supervised, task-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{Group Diffusion Transformers (GDTs)}, a novel framework that unifies diverse visual generation tasks by redefining them as a \\textbf{group generation} problem. In this approach, a set of related images is generated simultaneously, optionally conditioned on a subset of the group. GDTs build upon diffusion transformers with minimal architectural modifications by concatenating self-attention tokens across images. This allows the model to implicitly capture cross-image relationships (\\textit{e.g.}, identities, styles, layouts, surroundings, textures, and color schemes) through caption-based correlations. Our design enables scalable, unsupervised, and task-agnostic pretraining using extensive collections of image groups sourced from multimodal internet articles, image galleries, and video frames. We evaluate GDTs on a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 200 instructions across 30 distinct visual generation tasks, including picture book creation, font design, style transfer, sketching, colorization, drawing sequence generation, and character customization. Our models achieve competitive \\textbf{zero-shot} performance without any additional fine-tuning or gradient updates. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of key components such as data scaling, group size, and model design. These results demonstrate the potential of GDTs as scalable, general-purpose visual generation systems. We will release the code and models to support further research.",

While simple, I think the idea of binding multi-image attention is not quite novel. However, I would not say that such exploration should not be encouraged.\n- **Solidness**. The authors are training the model on their own dataset. I am not sure if the effectiveness mainly comes from the dataset or the model design.

The technical contribution of the paper is rather simple. To allow the generation of group of coherent images, self-attention tokens across multiple images are concatenated. The paper explains how it is applied to different diffusion transformer architectures (e.g., PixArt that decouples self- and cross-attention, SD3 that couples self- and cross-attention). The important bit of a paper is their data collection. The training dataset is scrawled from the Internet that contains a group of images. After some manual and automatic processing, authors were able to collect 500K image groups and further refined to 10K image groups of higher quality. These image groups are then described using multimodal LLMs to capture correlations among the images within each group. In experimental results, authors provide two metrics -- user study, which rates the goodness of the results by the GDTs, and automated metrics that measures the FID, content consistency or prompt adherence."

Though I understand that the paper might be the first of its kind that presents the unified solution for visual generation and editing tasks, there are many previous works that solve each of these problems, and having no comparison to those works makes the paper not very well grounded.\n\n---\n* Details on the training dataset is missing\n  * How many tasks do training dataset cover and how do their distributions look like?\n  * How many of these collected data are AI generated image sets?\n  * How much manual refinement (if exists at all) is requires for generating descriptions for image sets?\n  * See comments on zero-shot below.\n\n---\n\n* Several misleading claims:\n  * It is misleading to say \"unsupervised training on image groups\". It is effectively equivalent to the \"supervised training on input-output pair / tuples\" in the context of this paper. As such, the title of the paper \"unsupervised multitask learners\" could be misleading. Supervision (or weak supervision at least) is required to construct a set of image groups.\n  * Claims on zero-shot: authors should make sure that the training dataset do not contain the data for certain task to claim zero-shot. For example, can GDT perform subject customization if the training data does not contain a group of images that contain the same subject, or image completion from sketch if the dataset does not contain such (sketch, image) pairs? Also, would the data scale matter the zero-shot performance?\n\n---\n\n* Issue in evaluation\n  * FID evaluation: while authors hypothesized that training on a small dataset is easier to overfit, thus providing lower FID, this is not particularly convincing. On the other hand it raises a question on the evaluation dataset used for FID calculation. Would love to hear more on the distribution of eval dataset and how overfitting on the small training dataset could result in lower FID. Also, it would be great if authors could provide some generated images from a model trained with different training data scales.\n  * Unlike many other user study that evaluates the preference between the two or more images generated from different models, authors asked users to give a score from 1 to 5 for test examples and concluded that the average score of GDTs is higher than 3. However, this score is not calibrated at all, making it difficult to evaluate how good the model is. \n  * Not all tasks considered in this paper is new and there are tasks where abundant previous works exist, such as subject / style customization, image colorization, image variation generation, etc. While I understand that the difference between the GDT and those models that solves a single task, but the quality matters. The proposed user preference study or ablation metrics does not provide any points of comparison to existing works, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the GDT. Authors are required to provide at least a few additional data points for quality comparisons to existing works on more established tasks."

Despite the almighty GDTs claimed by the author, the visualization of many tasks (Fig.1,2) shows that downstream tasks\u2019 performance still has some issues. Explicitly speaking, using GDTs on image editing tasks, the quality of the results shows that preserving the ID/Style/Content remains challenging.
