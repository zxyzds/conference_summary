    "title": "Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have excelled in generating natural images and are now being adapted to a variety of data types, including graphs. However, conventional models often rely on Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle to accommodate the mixed discrete and continuous components characteristic of graph data. Graphs typically feature discrete structures and continuous node attributes that often exhibit rich statistical patterns, including sparsity, bounded ranges, skewed distributions, and long-tailed behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a generative model specifically designed to handle the diverse nature of graph data. GBD leverages a beta diffusion process, effectively modeling both continuous and discrete elements. Additionally, we propose a modulation technique that enhances the realism of generated graphs by stabilizing critical graph topology while maintaining flexibility for other components. GBD competes strongly with existing models across multiple general and biochemical graph benchmarks, showcasing its ability to capture the intricate balance between discrete and continuous features inherent in real-world graph data.",

                "value": "The paper proposes graph beta diffusion for the task of generating small graphs such as molecules. The core concept is approaching this task by adapting beta diffusion (Zhou et al., 2023), which is meant for generating data within bounded ranges (e.g., 0 to 1 for non-edge and edge) and is based on the beta diffusion rather than the Gaussian distribution. In addition to this core idea, the paper also explores several design ideas to strengthen the proposed method, including \"concentration modulation,\" which modify the diffusion distribution for important positions in the graph. The paper concludes with experiments on real and synthetic datasets, showing that the proposed method is at least competitive with other recently proposed methods in terms of matching certain graph statistics. There are also ablation experiments supporting the lift from the design ideas."

                "value": "- Since the main thrust of this paper is approaching graph generation with a diffusion method that is suited for bounded data, like the probability of each edge, there could be more discussion of alternatives to beta diffusion. What makes beta diffusion (Zhou et al., 2023) more suited for this task as opposed to, e.g., Dirichlet Diffusion Score Model (Avdeyev et al., 2023) or Dirichlet Flow Matching (Stark et al., 2024)?\n- Relatedly, given that the main thrust is application of beta diffusion, there could be more intuition given for beta diffusion itself, given that it was proposed in a recent paper.\n- With the exception of concentration modulation, little of the design seems specific to graphs, making this largely an application of a prior work to a specific domain. There could be more elucidation of what is gained from using beta diffusion vs standard diffusion in a graph context, e.g., some empirical or theoretical work showing that the beta distribution is more suited to capturing certain graph motifs.\n- $\\omega$ seems to be a key hyperparameter controlling the weight of two losses in beta diffusion. It seems unexplored here beyond reusing the value in the beta diffusion paper."

Additionally:\n\n- As stated on line 458, this method predicts $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{G}_0 | \\mathbf{G}_t$], which is not the standard diffusion setup, and as stated on line 160, this requires a neural network that predicts the conditional expectation of $\\mathbf{G}_0$ given $\\mathbf{G}_t$. Could the authors please expand on this design decision and its possible consequences? In particular, is it possible this reduces the diversity of samples?\n- Perhaps relatedly, regarding concentration modulation: How is $\\eta$, which corresponds to important positions in the sample, set at sampling time? Is the graph distribution generated by this method equivariant to permutations of the nodes?\n\n### Typos\n- Line 376 \"Transofrmer\"\n- Line 522 \"Centrailities\""

Could the authors clarify the practical impact of these results?\n- Tables 1 and 2 use different baseline models, omitting certain comparisons (e.g., Wave-GD, GraphARM, GNF, GraphVAE in Table 1; GruM, GDSS+TF, SPECTRE in Table 2). Tables are missing standard deviation values (Tables 2 and 3) and certain metrics (e.g., Spec. and V.U.N in Table 1), with no explanation for missing entries. Could the authors clarify their choices?\n- Does the proposed model offer any guarantees regarding the connectivity of the generated graphs?\n\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The provided equations in the paper are a bit challenging to follow, especially for readers unfamiliar with the work of Zhou et al. (2023). The authors might provide additional background or a summary of this prior work to improve readability. \n- The graph images in the first row of Figure 2 are unclear, and it is difficult to see the nodes and edges. The authors might consider improving the quality or resolution of these visuals.\n- Similarly, the SBM graph in Figure 3 is hard to interpret due to its size. Providing an adjacency matrix or alternative visualization might enhance readability.\n\nGiven the concerns outlined above regarding the experimental evaluations and originality of the paper, I recommend a rating of 5 for the paper."
