    "abstract": "Recent studies in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting reveal that explicitly modeling the hidden dependencies among different time series can yield promising forecasting performance and reliable explanations. However, modeling variable dependencies remains underexplored when MTS is continuously accumulated under different regimes (stages). Due to the potential distribution and dependency disparities, the underlying model may encounter the catastrophic forgetting problem, i.e., it is challenging to memorize and infer different types of variable dependencies across different regimes while maintaining forecasting performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework to perform MTS forecasting within a continual learning paradigm, which leverages structural knowledge to steer the forecasting model toward identifying and adapting to different regimes, and selects representative MTS samples from each regime for memory replay.\nSpecifically, we develop a forecasting model based on graph structure learning, where a consistency regularization scheme is imposed between the learned variable dependencies and the structural knowledge (e.g., physical constraints, domain knowledge, feature similarity, which provides regime characterization) while optimizing the forecasting objective over the MTS data. As such, MTS representations learned in each regime are associated with distinct structural knowledge, which helps the model memorize a variety of conceivable scenarios and results in accurate forecasts in the continual learning context.\nMeanwhile, we develop a representation-matching memory replay scheme that maximizes the temporal coverage of MTS data to efficiently preserve the underlying temporal dynamics and dependency structures of each regime. \nThorough empirical studies on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate SKI-CL's efficacy and advantages over the state-of-the-art for continual MTS forecasting tasks. SKI-CL can also infer faithful dependency structures that closely align to structural knowledge in the test stage.",

                "value": "This paper proposes Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL), a framework for multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting that addresses challenges posed by variable dependencies across different regimes. By leveraging structural knowledge (such as physical constraints and domain knowledge), SKI-CL aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve model adaptation to shifting data distributions. The framework utilizes dynamic graph learning with consistency regularization, aligning learned dependencies with structural knowledge for better regime recognition. A representation-matching memory replay scheme is introduced to retain essential temporal dynamics from each regime. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show superior forecasting accuracy and reliable dependency inference compared to state-of-the-art methods."

While the traceback of nodes is valid and transparent in the inference, in domain applications, calibrated regimes matter to model owners because it helps interpret the results in the format of narratives. The proposed learning and inference of graph structure contain Coverage Maximization and Representation Matching Selection which are unsupervised, therefore not yet assembled for regime calibration tasks."

Benchmarking regimes in multivariate time series forecasting is a foundation problem in MTS research, traditional econometrics method, e,g., Markov regime switch model that can be solved by EM algorithm can serve as a baseline model for regime discovery. Would that be something that can help bring the diverging methodologies to the same ground for a fair and reasonable competition, instead of the checking the numerical metrics?\n\n2. The message of Table 5 is to compare the number of baseline model parameters. Therefore, would it be better if the sorting is number of baseline model parameters instead of chronological order?"

In addition, in order to alleviate the forgetting problem, the authors propose a new memory replay method, which effectively preserves the temporal dynamics and dependency structure of historical regimes by selecting MTS data samples that satisfy the maximum temporal coverage.

The authors should identify the research topic and main contribution, instead of adapting continual learning to multi-variate time series forecasting.\n\n2.The design of structural knowledge-informed graph learning model lacks innovation. The parameterized graph learning is similar to many works, e.g., AGCRN [1]. The authors could further clarify how their graph learning method differs significantly from existing works.\n\n3.The analysis of representation-matching memory replay scheme is uncompleted:\n\n(1)The authors should clarify how their representation-matching memory replay scheme differs with other experience-replay methods.\n\n(2)The analysis of efficiency about the scheme is not well discussed in the paper. It would be beneficial to explain the scheme's efficiency from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. \n\n(3)The visualization of selected samples in the scheme should be included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.\n\n4.In section 3.4, the authors could explain the inference process more clearly.\n\n5.The paper has some weaknesses in the experiments, which are not convincing enough:\n\n(1)Since one of the main contributions is developing a graph-based forecaster, some recent graph-based time series forecasting models should be mentioned and compared, e.g., CrossGNN [2] and MSGNet [3]. In addition, the continual learning methods applied to forecasting methods are old and some latest methods could be compared.\n\n(2)Different datasets have different methods to construct regimes, e.g., by year, state, activity, and adjacency, authors could further investigate the effect of different construction methods on the performance of SKI-CL. Some construction methods, e.g., by state and activity, are not reasonable and deviate from the intention of continual learning. In addition, the paper misses details regarding the train-test data splits.\n\n6.From a reader's perspective, the authors should enhance presentation to avoid misunderstanding. For example, for Fig. 6, the horizontal coordinate and vertical coordinate of heat map should start from 1. For Table. 1, what do the bolded and underlined results mean? For Equation 3, what does the $n_K$ mean?\n\n7.Strong recommendation to make the code publicly available.\n\n[1] Bai, L., Yao, L., Li, C., Wang, X., & Wang, C. 2020.

Are other more commonly used datasets, such as METR-LA and PEMS04, also applicable to this method?  \n- 1.3 In the current manuscript, it seems that the effectiveness of modeling the change in dependency structures can only be validated through experimental results. Thus, the authors need to compare against a broader range of stronger baseline methods, such as latent (but static) graph models, dynamic (but predefined graph-based) models (e.g., DGCRN [2]), and non-graph models (e.g., STID[3], STNorm[4], STEAformer[5]). The baselines currently chosen by the authors are not strong enough. For example, TCN is a conventional temporal model, while PatchTST, DLinear, TimesNet, and iTransformer are long-sequence forecasting models that are not specifically designed for spatiotemporal prediction and do not explicitly model the dependency graph between sequences. Additionally, the code for GTS contains unintentional errors that significantly impact its performance compared to the original paper.\n\n2. **Lack of sufficient insights.**\n- 2.1 What are the core challenges and solutions in modeling the dynamic changes of dependency structures for time series forecasting?
