    "title": "X-Diffusion: Generating Detailed 3D MRI Volumes From a Single Image Using Cross-Sectional Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial diagnostic tool, but high-resolution scans are often slow and expensive due to extensive data acquisition requirements. Traditional MRI reconstruction methods aim to expedite this process by filling in missing frequency components in the K-space, performing _3D-to-3D_ reconstructions that demand full 3D scans. In contrast, we introduce _X-Diffusion_, a novel cross-sectional diffusion model that reconstructs detailed 3D MRI volumes from extremely sparse spatial-domain inputs\u2014achieving _2D-to-3D_ reconstruction from as little as a single 2D MRI slice or few slices.\nA key aspect of X-Diffusion is that it models MRI data as holistic 3D volumes during the cross-sectional training and inference, unlike previous learning approaches that treat MRI scans as collections of 2D slices in standard planes (coronal, axial, sagittal).\nWe evaluated X-Diffusion on brain tumor MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Our results demonstrate that X-Diffusion not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative accuracy (PSNR) on unseen data but also preserves critical anatomical features such as tumor profiles, spine curvature, and brain volume. Remarkably, the model generalizes beyond the training domain, successfully reconstructing knee MRIs despite being trained exclusively on brain data. Medical expert evaluations further confirm the clinical relevance and fidelity of the generated images.\nTo promote reproducibility and trust in our findings, we will publicly release the accompanying code upon publication. To our knowledge, X-Diffusion is the first method capable of producing detailed 3D MRIs from highly limited 2D input data, potentially accelerating MRI acquisition and reducing associated costs.",

Additional discussion would be great. \n\nIs it possible to integrate and check performance using existing text-to-3D models. Seems like utilizing directly 3D generative model provides more inductive bias, which should improve learning."

In contrast to traditional MRI reconstruction, X-diffusion takes on a different challenge and tries to predict the entire 3D volume given the sparse (but uncorrupted/high-quality slice(s)). The authors conduct a variety of different experiments on multiple datasets and downstream tasks and test the meaningfulness of pathological findings in the reconstructed images. Given their experimental setting, they are able to challenge the state of the art.  In a variety of ablation studies, the authors assess the impact of individual key components, providing an explanation of the capability of the model."

                "value": "Originality: While the proposed method is built upon recent advantages in computer vision, its combination of key components and area of application is novel. Especially the cross-sectional MRI synthesis approach, which enables the stacking of slices from arbitrary viewing directions, not just axial/coronal and sagittal planes, is of particular interest to the medical imaging community and constitutes - to the best of my knowledge - a unique contribution of the paper.\n\nQuality: The paper is written in a very clear, concise, and comprehensive way. I believe the authors did a great job in setting their method into the context of related work, thoroughly and clearly describing it, and performing an interesting experimental section, including further experiments in the supplementary material. The ablations clarified and addressed questions that I previously had when reading the manuscript and addressed different important parameters of the pipeline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the key components, such as the stable diffusion encoder, etc. \n\nClarity: The presented method, related work, and experiments are on point. Ablations serve a purpose, the mathematical foundation behind key concepts was explained quite well, and figures and tables provided a great way of deepening the understanding of the reader. The supplementary offered a lot of great insights and the possibility for reproduction of experiments. \n\nSignificance: The method of synthesizing a 3D volume with a cross-sectional model from arbitrary viewing directions is very interesting to the medical imaging community. Also, X-Diffusion tackles a unique reconstruction scenario, which is very much unexplored."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) Clinical relevance of the presented method: \n\nWhile the clinicians in this paper argue that the model is clinically relevant - I have a conflicting opinion. While \"scout\" or \"localizer\" scans with a single or a few slices may be acquired and thus used for X-Diffusion, I believe it is dangerous to assume that these will substitute a real volumetric scan. While the authors argue that tumor information is preserved, I would rather say this information is correctly hallucinated. Especially small tumors and lesions in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as MS, often occur on a few or single slices. Given that single or few-slice acquisitions will not be able to capture this information- (at all) - I would argue only undersampled or lower-resolved images pose a clinical tradeoff between finding anomalies and reducing scan time. I feel deep learning-based reconstruction really introduces a well-motivated use case for super-resolution or reconstruction in these problem settings, especially when considering multiple (complementary contrasts), but - to me - single/few slices are far-fetched and thus X-Diffusion solves a rather unrealistic clinical setting? Consequently, I would dial this down in the manuscript and frame this more as an exploratory or proof of concept study, i.e., \"confirmed the potential usefulness of the generated MRIs\" feels a bit bold to me.\n\nI would also be curious to see how the introduced method (key components would still have merit for these problem settings!) would perform on SR settings where we try to super-resolve anisotropic to isotropic scans. On another note, I acknowledge and really appreciate the study of k-space reconstruction. This poses a much more clinical use case, where X-diffusion is powerful but not on par (at least in scores) with SOTA (please correct me if I am wrong). \n\n2) Difficulty in assessing how much is owed to conditioning with the \"right\" slices and the capability of the model:\n\nWhile in regular medical image reconstruction, images are generally downsampled (in k-space) (c.f. ScoreMRI) or images with lower resolution are upscaled (TPDM), X-Diffusion has access to high-quality 2D slices that constitute a relevant part of the GT. In other words - the conditioning slices are not altered (i.e., they are identical and part of the GT). This is very different from the traditional scenarios - and thus poses a unique challenge in assessing the quality of the reconstruction. While the authors compare against SOTA baselines, these baselines were not originally designed to work as X-Diffusion works. This should be highlighted and discussed more prominently in the manuscript. I understand it is hard to come up with appropriate baselines, given that X-Diffusion is the first to attempt a single 2D slice to 3D reconstruction. However, the challenges that come with evaluating this should be more prominently discussed. \n\n3) Downstream Evaluation: \n\nEvaluation of the brain volume: While the brain volume estimation may serve as a first good downstream analysis task, I believe it constitutes an oversimplification of the problem. It would have been more meaningful to perform brain white-/grey matter analysis using, e.g., freesurfer on ground truth and reconstructed volume and comparing the results of this. \n\n4) Please share the SSIM for all tables and experiments; these values are often more relevant to PSNR values for reconstruction. \n\n5) A1 and A3 are almost identical. Consider merging or rewriting them to have one cohesive section."

                "value": "Clarification:\n\n- I really appreciate the ablation for healthy patient inpainting, c.f. 6.4, but it would have been really important to know how many healthy slices were used for the inpainting experiment. How many tumors do we see if we only provide slices at the outer parts of the brain where tumors will not lie? \n\n- For Figure 3, please clarify how many input slices are utilized from the target image. Considering the leftmost image is considered as input, am I right to assume that single-slice conditioning was utilized? However, given the crisp reconstruction, I would be surprised if this is the case. Was there tumor information in the conditioning - or is all of it impainted?\n\n- For Figure 6, which image(s) were used to condition X-Diffusion - was any of the tumor information of the presented slice present in the slice? If so, it is not surprising that the X-diffusion model is able to recover this \n\n- For Figure 9, Figure II/II Appendix (and more)  - how many slices were used to condition the model? \n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Please add SSIM scores alongside to the PSNR in the reconstruction experiments to the main paper (from supplementary).\n- Consider adding deep learning-based metrics for image reconstruction, such as medical LPIPS (https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html#perceptualloss) or LPIPS (https://github.com/richzhang/PerceptualSimilarity), as these often correlate better with human perception and are widely used in medical image reconstruction as well."

It is as if the authors tried all they could think of and let the readers do what they can with the results.\n- A major point that is often unclear in the experiments/results is what slice(s) was/were used as input. If the authors show in Figure VI that is has a impact on the results, it is not specified in other sections, e.g. 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. \n- The way the authors split the BraTS dataset is not clear. On the one hand, they state that the dataset includes 5,880 MRI scans from 1,470 patients (roughly four MRI sequences per patient) and that they split it into Train (n=4704), Validation (n=588), and Test (n=588) sets, without mentioning if it is done at the subject level or not, which could mean data leakage. On the other hand, they say that they just use the FLAIR sequence, so then the numbers do not add up. Please clarify.\n- When difference maps are displayed there is no scale, on top of the colormap poorly chosen, so they are impossible to analyse.\n- No estimate of variation is provided in the tables.\n- The evaluation by medical experts, though valuable, confirms that images generated are realistic but not that they show what they are supposed to, i.e. an image could be realistic but not correspond to the reality of a patient.\n- More philosophically speaking, I fail to understand how the authors see what they propose used in practice, which is what they state they aim for. In their scenario, patients would come to the imaging centre, have 2D slices acquired and pseudo 3D volumes reconstructed and then what? Would they go home and maybe be called to come back and have a normal exam later? If so in what case? This does not seem cost-efficient nor practical.\n- The related work section should cover super-resolution approaches. Also the Full-Body MRI Analysis paragraph is very generic and pretty empty. See for instance Tunariu et al., British Journal of Radiology, 2020 on the use of whole-body MRI in clinical practice and K\u00fcstner et al., Radiology: Artificial Intelligence, 2020 for the automatic analysis methods related to these applications.\n- Some references are too generic or do not correspond to the statement they are supposed to comfort, e.g. Tran et al., 2015; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015 or Kawar et al., 2022 in the second paragraph of the introduction."

So the overall premise of the work unfortunately seems more academic rather than something that would have a clinical impact.\n*\tIn prior work, there is a very incomplete analysis of work in image reconstruction and super-resolution. It is unclear what \u201cclassical\u201d means. based on the references, does classical mean anything without foundation models? This doesn\u2019t seem accurate.\n*\tIn figure 4, the acquisition is actually axial and study depicts the acquisition to be coronal. Since there is always a fully sampled dimension readout dimension in MRI, the reformatting of this 3D volume does not accurately convey the representational capacity of the model. Actual slice traversal needs to be in the *true* slice direction.\n*\tA better evaluation would be show a progression of PSNR values the further away a test slice is being computed from a conditioning slice.\n*\tAll datasets had 155 slices. In the case of using 31 conditioning slices, it is not clear why one should use this approach instead of just undersampling the 3D data by 5x and then reconstructing with variational methods. These methods can easily provide accelerations of 8-10x with much higher metrics.\n*\tIn figure 6, up until 10-13 slices, there are significant hallucinations in the structure and contrast of the grey and white matter. These results would cause radiologists quite a bit of anxiety!

This further shows how poor a metric PSNR is.\n*\tTotal brain volume is not the correct metric to assess fidelity. Cortical volumes and folding patters would be better. One would hypothesize that it is likely trivial to regress total brain volume from a single brain MRI slice anyway.\n*\tIt is pretty shocking to me why the model should be able to work in the OOD setting to synthesize knee MRI scans? Can the authors please provide a rationale why this should work in the first place? The UKB dataset includes IDEAL fat-water sequences that are MUCH lower resolution than the 2D TSE knee MRI fastMRI sequences that have a proton density contrast. Why should the model know this distribution Section 6.3 attempts to answer this but simply claiming Stable Diffusion training and large non-domain specific datasets unfortunately does not seem convincing."
