    "title": "Evolving Virtual World with Delta-Engine",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the \\emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace that people can live in. In a sense, any video game can be regarded as a virtual world. However, the fundamental difference between them is the evolving nature, which means the real world is constantly changed by humans' behavior, while existing virtual worlds are strictly defined by the back-end engine and cannot be changed by users' behavior.\nFor this, we propose a special world engine called \\textbf{\\emph{Delta-Engine}} to drive this virtual world. $\\Delta$ associates the world's evolution with the engine's scaling. It consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. The base engine programs the prototype of the virtual world; given a trigger, the neural proxy generates new snippets on the base engine through \\emph{incremental prediction}.\nThis paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to user-generated content. Technically, this is supported by dual aspects of algorithm and data. To do this, we leverage the retrieval technique to enhance the connection of the neural proxy and the base engine, and propose the human-LLM collaborative design to align the neural proxy with novel and interesting data.",

                "value": "Thank you for your review. We understand that you do not fully understand our paper. We should make our paper easily to understand for a broader audience.\n\nAs you require, we clarify the contribution of our work. Our contribution is multi-aspect.\n\n1. **Evolving world**\n\nWhy every living person looks greatly different? Our answer is that people can grow up as they wish, e.g. learn different skills. This is the idea of the evolving world.\n\n2. **A new engine proposed to facilitate the evolving world**\n\nFor example, as apart from existing RPGs, the roles in the game can be greatly similar if the player has finished the most of the game content. They can not learn new skills and meet new NPCs. To address this, delta-engine generates new code according the users' behavior to let the virtual world keep evolving, providing new game experience for players. For example, the player's role can learn his personal skills by the delta-engine.\n\n3. **Training data generation**\n\nThe purpose of generating training data is to enhance the LLM ability within the delta-engine. Our focus is the novelty and interestingness of the data, which is aligned with real player distribution. Thus, we propose two techniques, prototypes enhanced imagination and tag of interest (ToI).\n\n4. **Potential useful role data**\n\nWe construct a large amount of data of Pokemon roles in our project. All of them are in high quality. If you like, you can refer to them from the supplementary material in `asset`. They are also potentially useful for future researchers.\n\nEventually, we are confident that our work can make great contribution to the community. If you are confused for some parts in our paper, please let us know. We are willing to clarify. Thank you."

                "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**W1. Whether the engine needs to be changed to reflect the user's behavior**\n\nOur answer is absolutely yes. One of our main idea is that **every player can be different in the virtual world**, as shown in the film \"Ready Player One\". The fact is the player base is very large and their choices and largely outweigh the boundary of a static engine. **If the engine is static**, even if it is vey large, **all possibilities will be quickly exhausted by the players**.\n\n**W2. Some new words make it difficult to grasp the contribution of our work**\n\nThank you for your feedback. We are willing to clarify them in the new revision. On the other hand, we would like to emphasize that our work explores an entirely new scenario and **covers multiple aspects of contributions**, including the problem definition, inference algorithm, and data generation. We hope this broader context can provide clarity and better understanding of the scope of our work.\n\n**W3. Explain the evolving**\n\nEvolving in this paper can be simply understood as the ability of an object in the virtual world to grow new or unknown features. The necessity to evolve, please refer to W1. Thank you.\n\nWe are willing to provide the existing evidence for the claim \"Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems.\" Thank you for your suggestion.\n\n\n**W4. Definitions of some words**\n\n\"Its codebase will become more and more\" -> The code of the engine becomes larger.\n\n\"God mode\": One can instruct the engine as we wish.\n\n\"Biodiversity,\" \"Imagination\" are just what the words originally mean.\n\n**\"Tags of Interest\" is one techniques we propose to evaluate the interestingness in Section 5.2.**\n\n\n**W5.1. Delta-Engine description**\n\nFirst, learning to run and fly from walking serve as a concrete and toy example we use to illustrate the idea of the delta-engine. **It does not mean that the delta-engine can only be used to this scenario.** Instead, it conveys the general idea of the growing process of the nature.\n\n**W5.2. Input/output for incremental prediction**\n\nFor incremental prediction, the input is the user-instruction and the incremental value refers to the new code added to the engine.\n\nThe sparse version is detailed in line 153 to line 155. In brief, it is the skeleton overview of the engine's code. For example:\n\n```python\nPokemonBase\n- get_power\n- get_stats\n- move_1\n...\n```\n\n**Q1. Generalize the Delta-engine to other problems**\n\nIt is very challenging because different games/virtual worlds are greatly different in their settings, physical laws. This will be the point of our future work. The attempt in our paper is to build a specified delta-engine.\n\n**Q2. Benefit of using Delta-engine**\n\nThank you for your question. We need to clarify that delta-engine is not a traditional game engine (UE, Unity), which is used for game-development. Instead, delta-engine is an embedded module in the game system to offer new gaming experiences. Its feature is automatically generating new code based on the base engine, which is different from traditional game engines.\n\n**Q3. Difference to narrative generator**\n\nIt is unclear what the narrative generators exactly are. Are they used for generating instant plots or stories to push the game development [1] [2]? If they are driven by the user's behavior, then the concept may resemble that of the delta-engine. However, **the technical aspects between the narrative generator and delta-engine is quite different.** The latter focuses the scalability of the engine, e.g. generates the executable code on the base engine, rather than texts. Of course, the texts generated by the narrative generator should also be projected to the action space if it is a game, to my knowledge. To conclude, our work is different from narrative generators and we are willing to discuss this part in the related work. Thank you.\n\n**Q4. How to apply PCG**\n\nYes, the evolving process should follow the basic rules like physics. This is the potential setting in our work. All these properties are defined in the base engine and will not change. For example, the beating the Fire-type Pokemon can help the learning of a Fire-type move. This is the basic law in our game. Following these unchanged law, we can develop algorithms to generate the procedural content.\n\nPlease note that PCG is not our focus in this work. We only focus the delta-engines themselves.\n\n[1] NarrativePlay: Interactive Narrative Understanding\n\n[2] From Role-Play to Drama-Interaction: An LLM Solution"

                "value": "2. **Some details that we have already written in the paper**\n\nRespectfully, we are afraid you do not understand our methods and experiments at first.\n\nWe further clarify our experiment for Figure 5. In line 419 to line 420, we mentioned that \"we randomly sample abilities and moves from the existing database and repeatedly prompt the neural proxy to scale, until it gives a non-executable response.\" This sampling process, we repeat for 100 times and **each sampling is independent**, which means all of them have a different seed. The purpose is to reduce variance.\n\nFor Figure 6,  **your original question in your review is** \"it's unclear how the authors created their semantics and interestingness spaces or how they are projected into two dimensions.\". These parts are already included in the paper. Do I misunderstand your question?\n\n**Sure, we can further answer your second question**. The rule-based tagger is use to construct the interestingness vector in ToI. We have written an example in line 312 to line 313, \"For example, if a pokemon role can boost its power, it will inevitably overload the method get power.\". You may still not get the idea. That's ok. Here is the example code here.\n\n```python\ntag_dims = ['drain', 'heal', 'recoil', 'stat-boost', 'weaken', 'status', 'condition', 'env', 'priority', 'burn', 'paralysis', 'sleep', 'poison', 'freeze', 'power-boost', 'damage-boost', 'protect', 'shield', 'type-change', 'accuracy', 'crit', 'substitute', 'flinch', 'confusion', 'multi-hit', 'stat', 'type-effect']\n\ndef is_power-boost(code):\n    global vector\n    if \"def get_power\" in code:\n        vector[\"power-boost\"] = 1\n```\n\nWe acknowledge that these parts of the code is not attached in the supplementary. If you want, we can send you. However, please let us know **how these parts make it hard for you to verify the contribution of work** and **why this is so important to you to make a low rating for our paper**.\n\n3. **Volunteer issues**\n\nWe appreciate your further clarification of your concern. We are willing to discuss more on this. All 10 volunteers are my friends and they are college students. As I mentioned in the paper, all of them are not only experienced in playing Pokemon games, but also have a wealth of experience with a wide range of games. **This greatly allows them to design novel Pokemon roles.**\n\nOn the other hand, the volunteers do not feel pressure during their contribution. They are all Pokemon lovers. Before engaging our work, they already had the prototype ideas for their uniquely designed roles. Thus, they love their jobs and finish them with ease. Of course, I instructed them before starting to ensure that the newly-designed roles are strongly divergent from existing ones. However, this requirement is easy for them to fulfill.\n\nBack to our experiments, which plays a more important role in our paper. Our main focus is to **ensure the distributional gap between easy test set and hard test set.** **This allows us to evaluate the performance (e.g. generalize to OOD)** of the delta-engine in the experiments. Figure 6 and the aforementioned cases also prove this point. Do you agree with us on this point? If not, please raise and we will answer for that.\n\nHowever, if your focus is about ethic, e.g. volunteer's occupation, mood, which we believe are **irrelevant to the soundness of our experiments**, we are sorry that they cannot be addressed."

                "value": "Thanks to the authors for their quick and lengthy response. I will attempt to summarize my response to their responses: \n\n1. Implementation details and replication: From the text in the paper what is provided in the supplementary material is a \"demonstration\". The supplementary material code seems to include examples of generated Pokemon, but not the code to run all of the experiments in the paper. If I have misunderstood, I would ask the authors to point to the parts of the supplementary material that include the code for the experiments in the paper. \n2. Some details that we have already written in the paper: I think I may have not expressed these concerns clearly, apologies. I did read line 420, I recognize this was repeated 100 times. My concern was not the number of iterations but how many seeds were used. I also did read lines 463-465. The text states the authors \"obtain the interestingness vectors based on ToI\" but the detail on ToI is insufficient in the paper, with the authors mentioning a \"rules-based tagger\" and an example. I would also ask the authors to please come to this discussion in good faith. I understand the authors disagree with my review and I am amenable to discuss my concerns, but remarks that play down the time spent on my review are not appreciated.\n3. Citation recommendation: Sure, that's fair\n4. Unfaithful rating: As stated in my response to (2) I would encourage the authors to take to this discussion with a more professional attitude and to avoid attacks on a reviewer's ability or character\n5. Thanks to the authors for pulling out the prompt, that's helpful to see. However, reviewers are not required to look in the supplementary materials, and so it would be beneficial to include prompt structure in the paper/appendix.\n6. There is a clear risk for bias if the volunteers felt pressured in some way to take part in the human subject study. For example, if one of the authors is an instructor, employer, friends, or family of the volunteers. I am not saying this is the case but this is why these sorts of details are necessary to divulge. This is typically why ethics approval is sought for human subject studies, as this ensures that there was no undue bias on volunteers to take part."

The types of moves should be broad. \n\nYour reference animal:\nTyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. It is among the largest known land predators, with its estimated bite force being the largest among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods.\n\nYou should return like the following format.

Sure, we would like to mention them in our paper.\n\n4. **Unfaithful rating**\n\nWe appreciate that some of the points in the review are useful. The rating is still unfaithful. It seems that you get the general idea of our work and find our work technically novel though not surprising to you as you mentioned. However, **we have found no indication that there are technical flaws in our work or the entire contribution of our work is trivial**. So why all of our paper is rated with 1 score?\n\nTo conclude, we thank your time to review our paper. However, we are not convinced of your rating. In addition, we are confident that our work is solid and could make great contribution to the concerning community."

                "value": "This paper tries to tackle challenging problems to update game engines (usually static components of the virtual world) over time. However, the solution description on the problem is not clearly defined in the manuscripts. \n\nIn the Abstract, authors stated that \"existing virtual worlds are strictly defined by the back-end engine and cannot be changed by user's behavior.\" It's an interesting statement however, it's still questionable that the engine needs to be changed by user's behavior. It's a radical change to the world and there could be a solution to reflect the user's behavior's outcome to the world without changing the game engine itself. \n\nIn the Abstract, there are terms that make it difficult for readers to focus on the contribution. For example, they're \"scalability to user-generated content,\" \"dual aspects of algorithm and data,\" \"neural proxy,\" and \"novel and interesting data.\" It's relatively new to be difficult to grasp the concepts from the first reading. It's recommended to improve the summary to be readable for the audience. \n\nIn the Introduction, authors argue the necessity of \"evolving nature.\" What's the definition of the evolving in this paper to be used? I recommend authors to provide more explanation why back-bone engines needs to be \"evolving\" instead of other alternative solutions (evolving objects instead of changing the world itself) traditionally approached in many game-related articles. Also, it's good to add some evidence on \"Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems.\" \n\nAuthors need to improve their manuscripts by avoiding unclear definitions of words or terminologies. For example, they're \"Its codebase will become more and more along with the world's evolution.\" \"God mode,\" \"Biodiversity,\" \"Imagination,\" and \"Tags of Interest\" so on. \n\nIn Chapter 3, the Delta-Engine description needs to be improved. For example, the Base engine part includes \"only walking ability\" \"learns to run and even fly.\" It seems that the engine is limited to the sample scenario. It's desirable to provide a general introduction of the methodology. In the incremental prediction part, please explain what is the input, and what is the value? In the retrieval, what is the sparse version? \n\nIn conclusion, this paper's weak point is unclear description of their ideas with ill-defined justification of research goals."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This paper has a very large number of issues in its current state. To organize my feedback I'll introduce these issues in each section. \n\n### Introduction\n\nThe introduction has the primary issue of not being particularly relevant to the actual research work that has been done. There is no clear pathway from the authors prompt-based Pokemon generation to the virtual worlds they describe. It would be better to focus the paper on the specific research project being presented. I would further suggest that the authors remove all unsupported claims like \"Its codebase will become more and more along with the world\u2019s evolution\" or \"Delta-engines can serve as the basic components of the world to simulate their evolving processes, encompassing roles, surroundings, props, and other integral components\", given there's no proof of either in this paper or in prior work. Similarly, I would suggest the authors remove tangential sentences like \"The evolution is triggered by specific signals within the world, e.g. observations, behavior, and events.\". The introduction also introduces two other recurring issues in the paper. The first is that many of the figures are not legible, like the choice and size of font in figure 1. The second is that the language is very poor with many grammar or inappropriate wording issues, such as \"Such dynamics is unpredictable\"->\"Such dynamics are unpredictable\" or the use of \"Pokemon role\" when I believe the authors may have meant \"Pokemon character\". \n\nThe authors notably claim that code, data, and a demonstration are available in the supplementary materials, but this is untrue. There is a small Pokemon battling clone with some pre-generated elements.\n\n### Related Work\n\nThe authors cite a great deal of prior work, which is great. However, many of the citations are not relevant to this work. For example, the authors do not need to list all the AI work across various games in the final paragraph. Instead, I would have recommended that the authors discuss prior work in generating code for game characters [1,2]. In addition, the authors likely should have touched on prior work on generating Pokemon, though the majority of this prior work is focused on generating Pokemon-like visuals [3,4,5], some of the prior work does touch on descriptions [3] or type information [5]. \n\nIt is also notable that GameNGen is not based on prompts.\n\n### Delta Engine and Playground: Free Pokemon and Training Data Generation\n\nI am grouping all three of these as they make up the system overview equivalent sections of the paper. In general, the authors would ideally have included all technical aspects of the work in sufficient detail that they could be replicated. But this is not the case, the authors do not include their representation of Pokemon or rules (except via examples), they do not give their prompts or prompt structure, and most importantly they do not give how their co-creative setup works. Part of the problem here may be the lack of clarity (writing and language issues) in the paper.\n\n### Experiments \n\nThe authors present an experiment to show that their approach can recreate existing Pokemon and that it can recreate Pokemon created by human \"volunteers\". The issues here are primarily with the volunteers with the experiments otherwise being very reasonable for evaluating Pokemon generation. The authors do not specify if they had ethics approval for this human subject work or if the participants were compensated. It's also unclear what prior knowledge they had or what their relationship is to the authors. Without full methodological information it is impossible as a reader to judge the validity of their date, making the results related to it similarly difficult to trust. Similarly, it's unclear what the co-creative experience was or who the humans were who took part in it, making it very unclear how to interpret the \"& CO.\" results. These issues remove any generalizable knowledge other researchers may have been able to take from this experiment. \n\nFigures 5 and 6 similarly have issues in terms of how they were made and what they mean. For Figure 5, it's unclear if this experiment was run a single time or what all the colours and lines indicate. For Figure 6, it's unclear how the authors created their semantics and interestingness spaces or how they are projected into two dimensions.  \n\n\n1.

I am unable to judge the quality or purpose of any experiments done (or their motivations) because the writing is so confusing. I am not sure if it was written by a poor language model (the best ones would write something more understandable), or scientists that have not undergone any or at least proper training, but it is not ready for publication. If this is a well-intentioned attempt, I apologize for the harsh review, but I recommend you work closely with trained scientists to learn how to write a clear manuscript that meets the bar for scientific manuscripts. There are some hints of some good ideas, but they are far from being dealt with properly enough to evaluate them, let alone endorse the entire manuscript for publication. \n\nThis is the shortest review I have ever written in over 20 years in the field.
