    "title": "COT: Consistent Optimal Transport with Applications to Visual Matching and Travelling Salesman Problems",
    "abstract": "This paper generalizes the vanilla Optimal transport (OT) to the so-called Consistent Optimal Transport (COT) accepting more than two measures as input with transport consistency. We formulate the problem as minimizing the transport costs between each pair of measures and meanwhile requiring cycle-consistency among measures. We present both the Monge and Kantorovich formulations of COT and obtain the approximate solution with added entropic and consistency regularization, for which an iterative projection (RCOT-Sinkhorn) algorithm is devised to improve the Sinkhorn algorithm. We show the superiority on the task of visual multi-point matching, in which our COT solver directly utilizes the cosine distance between learned features of points obtained from off-the-shelf graph matching neural networks as the pairwise cost. We leverage the algorithm to learn multiple matching and the experiments show a great improvement without more feature training. Furthermore, based on COT, we propose a new TSP formulation called TSP-COT and also adopt regularization to relax the optimization and use the modified RCOT-Sinkhorn algorithm to get the probability matrix of TSP routing. Then post-process search method  is adopted to get the TSP routs and the experiments show the superiority of our method. The code will be available.",

                "value": "This paper extends the scope of Optimal Transport (OT) theory to cases involving more than two probability distributions, introducing a framework called Consistent Optimal Transport (COT). The authors explore transportation among three (or more) probability measures while enforcing cycle-consistency, which ensures that the transport plan respects consistency across the measures. Unlike the traditional OT problem, the COT's Kantorovich formulation becomes a nonlinear optimization problem due to these additional constraints. To address computational challenges, the authors propose a regularized version of COT using entropic and cycle-consistency regularization, which leads them to use the Sinkhorn algorithm for approximate solutions. As a by-product, this work offers a novel formulation for the Traveling Salesman Problem, offering insights into finding the shortest route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point."

                "value": "## 1. Clarity\n\nOverall, the paper lacks clarity in its writing. Key issues include the following:\n\n**Unclear or Misleading Statements:** Numerous sentences are either unclear or misleading. For example, in the abstract, it\u2019s stated that the COT problem considers each pair of measures, which implies that one must compute the optimal transportation cost between all pairs, i.e., between each $\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_j$, for $1 \\leq i, j \\leq K$. However, the paper actually focuses only on transportation between adjacent measures, $\\alpha_k$ and $\\alpha_{k+1}$.\n\n**Inconsistent and Incorrect Notation:** Mathematical notation is inconsistently and sometimes incorrectly applied. For instance, the scalar product is denoted by < x, y >, which should be written as \\langle x, y \\rangle or using the braket package for $\\braket{x, y}$. Additionally, notations should be standardized\u2014sometimes measures contain $N$ points, while other times they contain $n$. Such issues, though minor in isolation, collectively impede readability.\n\n**Formatting of Proofs:** The proofs in the appendix are poorly formatted, with equations split across multiple lines without necessity (for example, $d P_k$ at the end of Eq. (25) and in Eq. (26)). This formatting makes it difficult to review the proofs accurately.\n\n**Placement of Algorithms:** The algorithms are all placed in the appendix but are referenced in the main paper as if they were essential. While it\u2019s acceptable to include optional material in the appendix, the main text should be self-contained. Therefore, the algorithms should either be included in the main paper if they are necessary or clearly marked as optional if they\u2019re not.\n\n**Lack of Informative Content in Some Sentences:** Some sentences add little information. For instance, the introductory sentence, \"Optimal transport (...) is a tool to learn the optimal transportation between the source and target probability measures,\" requires prior knowledge of what optimal transportation means, offering minimal insight. Additionally, comparisons with the Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) problem are not particularly useful here, as the GW problem is fundamentally different and is not introduced in this work. Relaxing the cycling constraint to a penalty seems natural and doesn\u2019t require extensive justification.\n\n## 2. Motivation of the method, comparison with multi-marginal OT, soundness, and mathematical grasp on the problem. \n\nThe motivation for introducing the COT problem is limited, and the authors seem to lack critical distance from their work. For example:\n\n**Motivation of the approach and Comparison with multi-marginal OT (MMOT):** It is regularly said that the contribution of this paper is to \"generalize the OT problem to more than two marginals \" (abstract, contributions section, etc.), but this is precisely what multi-marginal OT is about. The paper mentions multi-maginal OT and, while I understand the formal difference between the two approach (they are different problems, for sure), I fail to see the practical difference: when should one use MMOT or COT? The paper does not give a proper answer to this central question in my opinion. \n\n**Dependence on the Order of Measures:** The formulation of the COT problem depends on the order of $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_K$, yet this is not discussed. This could be crucial; for example, if a user has a set of measures from an experiment, how should they be ordered? Is the solution permutation-equivariant? (in which case I would agree that the ordering does not matter)\n\n**Applicability of Birkhoff\u2019s Theorem:** The authors assume discrete uniform measures with $N$ points each, but it\u2019s unclear whether Birkhoff\u2019s theorem applies here. Specifically, is it generally true that the optimal $P_1, \\dots, P_K$ are permutation matrices if we only assume that $P_k \\in U(a_k, a_{k+1})$ in Eq. (8) rather than $P_k \\in {0,1}^{N \\times N}$? Understanding this is essential for motivating the adaptation to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the behavior of entropic regularization as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, and related points.\n\n**1D Case in Figure 2:** In Figure 2, the measures are depicted in 1D. In this case, it\u2019s known that the standard OT plan is monotone, involving matching quantiles. Unless something is overlooked, this suggests that cycle-consistency is automatically satisfied without enforcement, making this experiment barely supporting the proposed approach. Could this be confirmed?\n\n### Note\n\nDespite my negative rating, I want to stress that I do like the proposed problem, I just feel that in its current state, the work is not ready for publication and I encourage the authors to revise it, go deeper into their understanding of the COT problem to make it a good candidate in the computational OT community."
