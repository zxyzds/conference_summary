    "abstract": "Flow matching, one of the attractive deep generative models, has recently been used in wide modality.\nDespite the remarkable success, the flow matching objective of the vector field is insufficient for maximum likelihood estimation. \nPrevious works show that adding the vector field's high-order gradient objectives further improves likelihood.\nHowever, their method only minimizes the upper bound of the high-order objectives, hence it is not guaranteed that the objectives themselves are indeed minimized, resulting in likelihood maximization becoming less effective.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to directly minimize the high-order objective.\nSince our method guarantees that the objective is indeed minimized, our method is expected to improve likelihood compared to previous works.\nWe verify that our proposed method achieves better likelihood in practice through experiments on 2D synthetic datasets and high-dimensional image datasets.",

The theoretical analysis is somewhat limited in terms of offering strong mathematical assurances for the proposed approach's superiority.\n\n2.The theoretical results rely on several assumptions, such as bounding the Fisher divergence by a function of high-order objectives. These assumptions may not always hold in practical applications, especially when dealing with more complex data distributions or models.\n\n3.The experiments are incomplete: the methods compared in the paper have not been evaluated on all datasets. The method proposed in this paper did not achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on MNIST, it was only compared with one method."
