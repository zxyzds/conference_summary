    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle a challenging and extreme form of subpopulation shift, which is termed compositional shift. Under compositional shifts, some combinations of attributes are totally absent from the training distribution but present in the test distribution. We model the data with flexible additive energy distributions, where each energy term represents an attribute, and derive a simple alternative to empirical risk minimization termed compositional risk minimization (CRM). We first train an additive energy classifier to predict the multiple attributes and then adjust this classifier to tackle compositional shifts. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of CRM, where we show that our proposal extrapolates to special affine hulls of seen attribute combinations. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirms the improved robustness of CRM compared to other methods from the literature designed to tackle various forms of subpopulation shifts.",

However, the experiments are limited to only two attributes. I suggest that the authors include empirical results with multiple attributes to better align with the theoretical analysis.\n\n2. **Results**: While the CRM results outperform the baselines in this study, I check the original benchmark paper [1] and find that CRM\u2019s performance does not consistently exceed that of the baselines. Furthermore, the authors only report accuracy, which doesn\u2019t fully account for group imbalances. Reporting Macro-F1 scores would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n3. **\u201cDisjoint\u201d Setting**: I understand that the paper\u2019s chosen disjoint setting adds a level of complexity. However, in real-world scenarios, it is often feasible to obtain a small number of samples for different attribute combinations (particularly with only two attributes, as in these experiments). The proposed method should also be evaluated in traditional settings where all attribute combinations have some representation. This would confirm that the method performs well without requiring group-dropping."

The Compositional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework lacks explicit constraints on feature representations, which is widely recognized as crucial for generalization under sub-population shifts [1]. While CRM effectively models compositional shifts through additive energy distributions, it does not incorporate mechanisms to ensure the learned features are robust and semantically meaningful across different attribute combinations. Could the author make a further discussion on this problem?\n    \n    [1] Liu et al., Causal Triplet: An Open Challenge for Intervention-centric Causal Representation Learning, 2023\n    \n2. For the implementation of Algorithm 1, how to pre-specifies the spurious attribute $a$?\n\n3. The current experimental results are somewhat lacking of conviction. More advanced DG algorithms, e.g. IRM, VREx, Fishr, SelfReg, are recommended to be included in the experiments. \n\n4. The sample complexity $s$ w.r.t the dimension $d$ should be verified through simulation studies."

I am a little confused of the assumption 1: $p(x|z)=q(x|z)$\uff0ci.e.  the data generation mechanism from attributes to the inputs remains invariant, which is the main claim in the paper,  hence the distribution shift is essentially caused by $p(z)\\neq q(z)$, which further implies that $p(x)\\neq q(x)$, due to  $p(x)= \\int p(x|z)p(z)dz$, and $q(x)=\\int q(x|z)q(z)dz$. So, the covariate shift is caused by the marginal differences on the attributes. This seems contradict to traditional DG. \n\n2. For sample complexity $s\\geq 8cd\\log(d/2)$,  $c$ lacks of specifications?"
