    "title": "SafeDiffuser: Safe Planning with Diffusion Probabilistic Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown promise in data-driven planning. While these planners are commonly employed in applications where decisions are critical, they still lack established safety guarantees. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing SafeDiffuser, a method to equip diffusion models with safety guarantees via control barrier functions. The key idea of our approach is to embed finite-time diffusion invariance, i.e., a form of specification consisting of safety constraints, into the denoising diffusion procedure. This way we enable data generation under safety constraints. We show that SafeDiffusers maintain the generative performance of diffusion models while also providing robustness in safe data generation. We evaluate our method on a series of tasks, including maze path generation, legged robot locomotion, and 3D space manipulation, and demonstrate the advantages of robustness over vanilla diffusion models.",

Essentially we only care about the safety at t=0, and trajectories satisfying t=0 safety don\u2019t necessarily need to satisfy t=1 safety. However the method actively encourages the intermediate trajectories to be safe. This doesn\u2019t mean the method is wrong, but I\u2019m hoping to see a softer way to guarantee the safety. See Q2.\n2. Along with the above weakness, the design choice seems too complex. There\u2019re $\\epsilon$, $w$, $r$, $\\gamma$, $\\sigma$, all of them seem hyper-parameters that need careful tuning.\n3. CBF itself is meant to design for dynamics that are (1) time-invariant; and (2) deterministic. The diffusion process doesn\u2019t belong to any of these two parts. For (1), the alpha bar changes over time steps. For (2), most of the diffusion sampler constantly adds noise to the dynamics (unless the approach is specifically using DDIM). Applying CBF-based technique to the diffusion seems counter-intuitive. \n4. Scaling up seems challenging. I\u2019m hoping to see a highly nonlinear dynamics like drone/quadcopter to see whether the method could scale up. Another challenge for scaling up is from the selection criteria. Page 6 discusses the principle to select different safediffusers. As mentioned, it requires the unsafe set to be known to determine the convexity. This seems challenging for high-dimensional control tasks."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Regarding to the design choice, the TVS diffuser seems to be the most general safediffuser. Is it possible to further simplify the forward invariance equation (theorem 3.4) by fully discarding the reliance on b, and directly using sigma? For example, imagine sigma at t=0 converges to exactly b. This sigma can be used in analogy to the time-varying CBF and should impose a more relaxed restriction to the intermediate samples. I guess it would need clever design of sigma (or even learning-based), but do you think it is worth the effort?\n2. Another question is the motivation of using CBF. From first principle, all we care about here is the safety at the final timestep, ie, t=0. It sounds more similar to a goal-reaching/liveness problem, where you don\u2019t need to enforce every intermediate sample satisfy the safety. Compared to control Lyapunov function or reachability-based method, why is CBF used for the problem? Applying the other two concepts seem more natural to me.\n3. In control, CBF can usually be compared to potential-field based method to show their effective in terms of avoiding obstacle in a longer time horizon rather than reactively avoiding. Similarly, is it possible to include [1] as a baseline to show the approach\u2019s effectiveness? \n\n[1] Luo, Y., Sun, C., Tenenbaum, J. B., & Du, Y. (2024).
