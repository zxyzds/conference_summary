    "title": "Radial Basis Operator Networks",
    "abstract": "Operator networks are designed to approximate nonlinear operators, which provide mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces such as function spaces. These networks are playing an increasingly important role in machine learning, with their most notable contributions in the field of scientific computing. Their significance stems from their ability to handle the type of data often encountered in scientific applications. For instance, in climate modeling or fluid dynamics, input data typically consists of discretized continuous fields (like temperature distributions or velocity fields). We introduce the radial basis operator network (RBON), which represents a significant advancement as the first operator network capable of learning an operator in both the time domain and frequency domain when adjusted to accept complex-valued inputs. Despite the small, single hidden-layer structure, the RBON boasts small $L^2$ relative test error for both in- and out-of-distribution data (OOD) of less than $1\\times 10^{-7}$ in some benchmark cases. Moreover, the RBON maintains small error on OOD data from entirely different function classes from the training data.",

                "value": "The methodological description of the method is too short and not detailed enough, especially for unfamiliar readers.\nSome theoretical statements are made but the rest of the methodology would not allow re-implmenting the method. Figs 1 and 2 do not carry any information whatsoever; most equations about the network are implicitly embedded in the theorem.\nPart of the problem is that the paper describes a variant of NO/ON and the authors focus on the increment, probably for the sake of space, at the expense of making the paper difficult to read for the average reader.\nWith the amount of provided details, the proposed method seems to be very simple and very close to classical RBFNs with a product on top. The PDE and TSP tasks are not very convincing if they are not compared to other architecture and methods (X-RBON get compared to LNO only)."
