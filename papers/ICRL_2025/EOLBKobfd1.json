    "title": "Neural Circuit Architectural Priors for Quadruped Locomotion",
    "abstract": "Learning-based approaches to quadruped locomotion commonly adopt generic policy architectures like fully connected MLPs. As such architectures contain few inductive biases, it is in practice common to incorporate priors in the form of rewards, training curricula, imitation data, or trajectory generators. In nature, animals are born with priors in the form of their nervous system's architecture, which has been shaped by evolution to confer innate ability and efficient learning. For instance, a horse can walk within hours of birth and can quickly improve with practice. Such architectural priors can also be useful in ANN architectures for AI. In this work, we explore the advantages of a biologically inspired ANN architecture for quadruped locomotion based on neural circuits in the limbs and spinal cord of mammals. Our architecture achieves good innate performance and comparable final performance to MLPs, while using less data and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture also exhibits better generalization to task variations, even admitting deployment on a physical robot without standard sim-to-real methods. This work shows that neural circuits can provide valuable architectural priors for locomotion and encourages future work in other sensorimotor skills.",

The authors should be careful to claim the \"First neural circuit model for quadrupedal robot locomotion\", and investigate deeper into older papers from 10, 20, or even 30 years ago, there were papers that used complex CPGs to generate gaits for legged robot locomotion. \n\nBesides, the key contributions 2 and 3 stated on page 2 are not contributions but simply good practices when researching bioinspired models for robots. The texts from lines 124 to 132 read like contributions but need a better summary.\n\nThere is no comparison between the model with SOTA RL models.\n\nThe model is not presented very well mathematically. The corresponding section should be in the main text but not the appendix."

Does the robot use any sensor except the joint sensors? Can it only walk straight? Can it change gaits?\n4. What does the Brainsem command refer to? How does this part of the model work? Are there any reference papers for it? Are there any plots or examples for the command?\n\nThe score for the paper could either be up or down according to the responses."

Instead of using traditional artificial intelligence that needs lots of training data, this system copies the natural nerve circuits found in animal legs and spinal cords, using only 92 parameters (while traditional methods use nearly 80,000) yet works remarkably well. The system helps robots walk naturally and adapt to different surfaces, demonstrating that copying designs from nature can create better and more efficient robot control systems."

However, this research method was only tested on flat and bump terrains, and did not verify whether quadruped NAVP can achieve motion control of quadruped robots in more complex scenarios.\n3. It has been demonstrated in the experiment that the prior knowledge of quadrupled NAVP is valuable. However, the PPO trained solely on speed tracking as a reward signal does not perform well and cannot prove its performance advantage compared to reinforcement learning."

The locomotion control of quadruped robots on multiple terrains is already quite mature, why not train models on more complex terrains? Is it because the generalization of the method is limited?\n3. The online reinforcement learning algorithm PPO is relatively easy to implement for motion control of robots on flat ground and can be deployed to physical objects, but using only speed tracking rewards cannot train useful PPO algorithms. Although your experiment has proven the value of prior knowledge, what are the performance advantages of your method?Are there any issues with the subjects of the comparative experiment?"
