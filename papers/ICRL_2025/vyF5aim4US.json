    "title": "QFree-Det: Query-Free Detector with Transformer and Sequential Matching",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based detectors, such as DETR and DINO, often struggle with a specific limitation: they can detect only a fixed number of objects based on the predefined number of queries set. This limitation leads to missed detections when the scene exceeds the model\u2019s capacity and increases false positives when the scene contains fewer objects. In addition, existing approaches often combine one-to-one and one-to-many matching label assignment methods in the decoder for accelerating the model training and convergence. However, this operation can introduce a new detecting ambiguity issue, which is often overlooked by those methods. To address these challenges, we propose QFree-Det, a novel query-free detector capable of dynamically detecting a variable number of objects across different input images. In particular, we present an Adaptive Free Query Selection (AFQS) algorithm to dynamically select queries from the encoder tokens, which resolves the issue of fixed capacity. Then, we propose a sequential matching method that decouples the one-to-one and one-to-many processes into separating sequential steps, effectively addressing the issue of detecting ambiguity. To achieve the sequential matching, we design a new Location-Deduplication Decoder (LDD) by rethinking the role of cross-attention (CA) and self-attention (SA) within the decoder. LDD first regresses the location of multiple boxes with CA in a one-to-many manner and then performs object classification to recognize and eliminate duplicate boxes with SA in a one-to-one manner. Finally, to improve the detection ability on small objects, we design a unified PoCoo loss that leverages prior knowledge of box size to encourage the model to pay more attention to small objects. Extensive experiments on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our QFreeDet. For instance, QFree-Det achieves consistent and remarkable improvements over DINO across five different backbones. Notably, QFree-Det obtains a new state-of-the-art of 54.4% AP and 38.8% APs on val2017 of COCO with the backbone of VMamba-T under 1\u00d7 training schedule (12 epochs), higher than DINO-VMamba-T by +0.9% AP and +2.2% APs. The source codes will be released upon acceptance.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "> Comparison with DETA and DDQ-DETR:\n\nThe discussions in Section 3.1.3 regarding the role of Self-Attention (SA) bear similarities to the disscussions taken in \"NMS Strikes Back\" (DETA) [1] and \"Dense Distinct Query for End-to-End Object Detection\" (DDQ-DETR) [2]. Both papers explore the effectiveness of traditional non-maximum suppression (NMS) and the role of SA integrated with transformer-based detectors, which is a relevant area of comparison for QFree-Det.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06137\n\n[2] Dense Distinct Query for End-to-End Object Detection (CVPR2023)\n\n> Comparative Experiments in Table 3:\n\nWhile the paper provides comparisons with models like DINO, it lacks a comprehensive set of comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art Transformer detectors, such as Stable DINO and CO-DINO. Including these comparisons would provide a more holistic view of QFree-Det's performance relative to the current landscape of object detection models.\n\n> Performance Comparison with Fixed Detectors:\n\nThe paper compares the performance of QFree-Det (AP 50.5) with DINO (AP 49.0). However, it is noted that improved versions of DINO, utilizing focal loss, have achieved an AP of 50.0, as demonstrated in the MMDETECTION repository. This raises the question of whether other state-of-the-art fixed detectors, when combined with loss functions like PoCoo or IA-BCE, could potentially outperform QFree-Det. Further experimentation and comparison with these models would be beneficial to assert the superiority or uniqueness of QFree-Det's approach."

The main idea of the proposed Adaptive Free Query Selection (AFQS) algorithm: The fixed content query (CQ) is replaced by the proposed flexible self-adaptive decoder query (SADQ), where SADQ is obtained by sorting the classification scores of all N encoder tokens and selecting the scores above a certain threshold as M SADQ. In short, the AFQS algorithm is a simple strategy to reduce N queries into M queries by sorting the classification scores. I don't think it is enough to be a main contribution.\n2. The novelty of sequential matching is incremental, where sequential matching combines Box Locating Part (One-to-many matching), and Deduplication Part (One-to-one matching). One-to-many matching and One-to-one matching are the existing methods.\n3. The framework of Box Locating Part (One-to-many matching) and Deduplication Part (One-to-one matching), looks complex. Deduplication Part (One-to-one matching) can be replaced by the parameter-free NMS. The Deduplication Part (One-to-one matching) looks more complex than NMS.\n4. PoCoo loss is useful for small object detection. However, the connection between PoCoo loss and the motivation of designing a query-free detector, is very weak.\n5. Dynamic query selection and the dual-step decoding process may require more computational resources, potentially impacting processing speed in real-time detection applications.\n6. According to Table 5, free-query with AFQS only is worse than fixed-query."
