    "title": "OML-AD: Online Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data",
    "abstract": "Time series are ubiquitous and occur naturally in a variety of applications -- from data recorded by sensors in manufacturing processes, over financial data streams to climate data. Different tasks arise, such as regression, classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.",

I think the overall approach has too little workload and lacks innovation, as it simply uses the prediction error between the predicted values of an existing online forecasting model and the actual values, with a threshold to determine if it\u2019s an anomaly. Even the method for updating \u03bct and \u03c3t, which are key to calculating the threshold, is based on previous studies.\n\nW2. The experiments conducted in the paper primarily utilize a narrow range of datasets, including one synthetic dataset and one real-time dataset with added synthetic anomalies. The authors should consider adding more real-world datasets, particularly those with varying degrees of concept drift and different types of anomalies. \n\nW3. While the paper compares the proposed approach to a few existing methods, the selection of baseline models appears limited. For a more robust evaluation, the authors should include a wider variety of state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q1. I would like to inquire whether the MAE and MSE performance of OML-AD is solely dependent on the models used within it. From my understanding, OML-AD does not incorporate specific measures to impove MAE and MSE performance. Therefore, I believe that to effectively demonstrate the performance of OML-AD, it should be compared with models having similar MAE and MSE performance.\n\nQ2. In the 4 METHODOLOGY section of the article, three methods for calculating threshold are mentioned: simple choice using  \u03bct and \u03c3t, based on the common assumption of residuals' normality and using extreme value theory to find a more conservative threshold. However, only the first method was used in the experiments. I think corresponding experiments should be added to showcase their application scenarios.\n\nQ3. To showcase the effectiveness of OML-AD, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with several recent state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, rather than relying solely on SARIMA and Prophet, which were originally designed for forecasting but have been repurposed for anomaly detection.\n\nQ4. While the synthetic dataset in Figure 2 shows some degree of concept drift, I believe that recent state-of-the-art anomaly detection models can handle such scenarios well. Could the authors provide examples of situations that are particularly challenging for other models but can be effectively addressed by OML-AD?"
