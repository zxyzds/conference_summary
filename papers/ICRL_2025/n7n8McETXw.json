    "title": "Training Nonlinear Transformers for Chain-of-Thought Inference:  A Theoretical Generalization Analysis",
    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is an efficient prompting method that enables the reasoning ability of large language models by augmenting the query using multiple examples with multiple intermediate steps. Despite the empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how to train a Transformer to achieve the CoT ability remains less explored. This is primarily due to the technical challenges involved in analyzing the nonconvex optimization on nonlinear attention models. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first theoretical study of training Transformers with nonlinear attention to obtain the CoT generalization capability so that the resulting model can inference on unseen tasks when the input is augmented by examples of the new task. We first quantify the required training samples and iterations to train a Transformer model towards CoT ability.  We then prove the success of its CoT generalization on unseen tasks with distribution-shifted testing data. Moreover, we theoretically characterize the conditions for an accurate reasoning output by CoT even when the provided reasoning examples contain noises and are not always accurate. In contrast, in-context learning (ICL), which can be viewed as one-step CoT without intermediate steps, may fail to provide an accurate output when CoT does. These theoretical findings are justified through experiments.",

The central result of the paper is a quantitative characterization of the training dynamics that leads to CoT ability. Using this, the authors characterize how the noise and relevance of the in-context examples affect the CoT performance. The final result compares the error rates for ICL with CoT and ICL without CoT with the main conclusion that while the rates are similar, ICL without CoT needs the examples to be dominantly correct, while CoT does not need this. Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical results."

The validation was confined to binary classification tasks, thereby restricting the generalizability of the theoretical findings.\n2. **Formula Accuracy**: The paper requires a meticulous review of its mathematical expressions. For instance, in Example 1, the function should be denoted as \\( f_2(\\mu_2') = \\mu_1' \\) instead of \\( f_1(\\mu_2') = \\mu_1' \\), and the second matrix \\( A_1^f \\) should be corrected to \\( A_2^f \\). It is essential to verify all formulas throughout the text to ensure accuracy.\n3. **Theorem Validity and Clarification**: The theorems presented in the article should be scrutinized for their validity, particularly the sections that substantiate reasoning, as they may induce some ambiguity. Reading the appendix is mandatory for a comprehensive understanding of the article; otherwise, it might lead to misconceptions.\n4. **Originality Concerns**: The article's reasoning and writing logic bear similarities to those found in \"How Do Nonlinear Transformers Learn and Generalize in In-Context Learning.\" It raises the question of whether this work is merely an extension of the previous study or if it introduces novel contributions."
