    "title": "Differentiable Polygon Modeling for Object Instance Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Differentiable polygon (boundary-/contour-based) modeling for object instance segmentation remains an open problem in computer vision and deep learning. It also has been under-explored in the deep learning era, compared with its counterpart, bit-mask (region-based) modeling. In this paper, we present a method of differentiable polygon-based instance segmentation. As commonly done in the prior art, we assume a fixed topology, i.e., the number of vertices, $K$ is predefined and fixed (e.g., $K=250$) in learning and inference. We address two modeling problems: i) The alignment between a predicted $K$-vertex polygon and a target ground-truth $L$-vertex polygon in learning, where $L$ varies significantly. We present PolygonAlign similar in spirit to RoIAlign used in bit-mask-based instance segmentation, which enables using a simple $\\ell_2$ norm as the vertex prediction loss function in learning. ii) The parameterization of a $K$-vertex polygon. We present a variant of the active contour model,  which consists of a learnable contour initialization module and an one-step vertex-aware refinement/updating module. The initialization is learned via an affine transformation decoupled vertex regression method. A polygon is parameterized by a translation vector, a rotation transformation matrix, and the vertex displacement vectors. In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the MS-COCO 2017 benchmark using the Sparse R-CNN framework. It obtains state-of-the-art performance compared with the prior art of polygon modeling methods. We also show the empirical upper-bound performance of the proposed method is much higher than all existing instance segmentation methods, which encourages further research on differentiable polygon modeling.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a novel framework for object instance segmentation based on differentiable polygon modeling, addressing instance segmentation via a polygon-based approach in contrast to widely used bit-mask methods.\nIt proposes PolygonAlign, which utilizes a contour-length-fraction (CLF) based vertex re-sampling strategy for aligning fixed K-vertex predicted polygons with varying L-vertex target ground-truth polygons using a simple L2 norm in learning.\nIt also presents an affine transformation decoupled vertex displacement regression method for polygon parameterization that cooperates with PolygonAlign.\nIt achieves SOTA results on MS-COCO among contour-based instance segmentation methods. The work addresses important challenges in making polygon-based approaches differentiable and competitive with mask-based methods."

To showcase the method's effectiveness, the authors should compare with stronger baselines using better backbones/training protocols. Otherwise, it is not convincing why the method is more promising than other approaches.\n- The computational complexity and inference time analysis is missing.\n- The method still relies on fixed topology (K vertices), limiting its flexibility.\n- The authors should verify their method on more datasets such as Cityscapes, LVIS, etc.\n\nOverall, the performance of this paper is not strong enough for this competitive instance segmentation task. If the authors believe polygon-based methods are promising, they should revise their experimental results with better baselines or find a better experimental setting (such as for improving human annotation)."

It is well-known that polygons are harder to learn and are limited to only connected instances. The authors did not discuss what taking polygons as training targets brings to us. Therefore, from this view, the paper is not well motivated.\n2. The performance is moderate. The results in Table 1 do not show the instance segmentation results of the Sparse R-CNN method, which is the base model used by the authors and should be an important baseline. Since previous approaches listed in Table 1 applied different base models, the comparison cannot prove the method's advantage convincingly. Besides, Table 2's results also show that the improvement of the affine transformation is marginal.\u00a0\n3. The original Sparse R-CNN reports AP 42.8%~46.4% on the COCO val set with different backbones. However, the authors claimed it can only achieve 37.9% (line 369). Therefore, the reviewer suggests aligning the base model with the original Sparse R-CNN for a more convenient comparison.\n4. It lacks ablation studies of the refinement strategy."
