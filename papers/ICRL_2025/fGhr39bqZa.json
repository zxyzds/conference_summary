    "title": "Recovery of Causal Graph Involving Latent Variables via Homologous Surrogates",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery with latent variables is an important and challenging problem. To identify latent variables and infer their causal relations, most existing works rely on the assumption that each latent variable has multiple pure children that must have no other parent except the latent variable itself. Considering that this assumption is potentially restrictive in practice and not strictly necessary in theory, by introducing the concept of homologous surrogate, this paper eliminates the need for pure child in the context of causal discovery with latent variables. The former fundamentally differs from the latter in the sense that a homologous surrogate is allowed to have other parents besides the latent variable it represents. We formulate two assumptions involving homologous surrogates and develop theoretical results under each assumption. Under the weaker assumption, our theoretical results imply that we can determine each variable's ancestors, that is, partially recover the causal graph. The stronger assumption further enables us to determine each variable's parents exactly, that is, fully recover the causal graph. Building on these theoretical results, we derive an algorithm that fully leverages the properties of homologous surrogates for causal graph recovery. Also, we validate its efficacy through experiments. Our work broadens the applicability of causal discovery.",

                "value": "This paper introduces the concept of homologous surrogates to address the challenges associated with causal discovery involving latent variables. It formulates two assumptions regarding homologous surrogates and develops theoretical results based on each assumption. Under the weaker assumption, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of partially recovering the causal graph by identifying the ancestors of each variable. The stronger assumption facilitates the exact identification of each variable's parents, enabling full recovery of the causal graph. Additionally, the paper proposes an algorithm that effectively leverages the properties of homologous surrogates for causal graph recovery and validates its effectiveness through experimental results."

The technical contributions appear to be somewhat constrained. This paper draws upon two established methodologies, pseudo-residuals and causal effect estimation via cumulants. It introduces the concept of homologous children, which is fundamentally equivalent to the notion of pure children.\n\n3. The authors mentioned that their work expands the applicability of causal discovery methods, and that homologous surrogates aid in causal discovery with latent variables. However, in the experimental results involving real-world data, their proposed method performs poorly. The authors believe this is due to a limited sample size. So, are there more suitable real-world datasets available to validate the method proposed in this paper?"

This would aid readers in understanding the concept more intuitively.\n\n2. Some of the most closely related works have not been mentioned in the introduction. For example, [Dong et al., 2024] consider almost the same problem with a very similar motivation, i.e., relaxing the structural assumptions among latent and observed variables. That work also allows the existence of children for observed variables. Currently, the discussion was only in the remark and related work at the end of the manuscript, but not in the introduction.\n\n3. In line 82, it states that the considered setting is new in causal discovery. However, it might not be accurate since causally-related latent variables have been considered before, even in the presence of observed variables' children. I understand that omitting works such as [Dong et al. 2024] in the introduction would make the story clearer, but it might introduce confusion for readers less familiar with the field.\n\n4. In line 45, it seems to state that [Jin et al. 2024] make the pure children assumption, which might also not be true."

It might be better to give empirical complexity analysis in the experiments, compared with other baselines.\n\n2. Regarding the simulated causal graphs in Figure 5 for the experiments, I think the networks are all small. It could help to investigate the performances when there are more latent variables and when the causal relations between latent variables are sparse.\n\n3. It might be better to give simple descriptions and basic conclusions of the experiment on the real-world dataset Holzinger and Swineford, in the main paper. BTW, from Appendix C, the performances on such a real-world dataset look not satisfactory.\n\n4. It is good to give examples for the definitions. But I think giving examples for the theorems also matters since it is hard to catch the main idea or intuitions for the basic theorems."

Since $M_O^O$ is derived from Algorithm 1, which could contain some spurious edges.\n\n2.\tAs illustrated by the authors, their algorithms suffer from cases with small sample sizes but could achieve ideal performances when assumptions are met and the sample sizes are large enough. For example, in ideal Case 2 of the experiments, how many samples are needed to achieve the ideal results?\n\n3.\tIf the number of latent variables is not estimated correctly, what would happen? Did it greatly impact the final results?\n\n4)\tThe following paper [1] tackles the same problem and also allows non-pure children. Hence I suggest discussing the differences and connections with it.\n\n[1] Xie F, Huang B, Chen Z, et al.
