    "title": "SLIM-LLMs: Low-Rank Models of Linguistic Style",
    "abstract": "Linguistic style encompasses a range of dimensions, including sensorial language as well as traditional stylistic features (represented using LIWC features). While these dimensions of linguistic style have been studied independently, relationships between the different dimensions, particularly between sensorial style and traditional stylistic features, remain understudied. This paper introduces a novel approach to model this interaction and tests it across a diverse set of texts. \nIn particular, we propose using a Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) to model low-rank latent relationships between LIWC-based stylistic features and sensorial language features. We find that compared to the full LIWC feature set ($r = 74$), its low-dimensional latent representations ($r = 24$) effectively capture stylistic information relevant to sensorial language prediction.\nBased on our results, we propose Stylometrically Lean Interpretable Models (SLIM-LLMs) \u2014 dimensionality-reduced LLMs that model the non-linear relationships between these two major dimensions of style. We evaluate SLIM-LLMs on the ability to predict sensorial language (the actual sensorial words used) in five text genres: business reviews, novels, song lyrics, advertisements, and informative articles. Results show that SLIM-LLMs augmented with low-rank style features consistently outperform baseline models. These SLIM-LLMs approach the performance of full-scale language models while using significantly fewer parameters (up to 80\\% reduction).",

                "value": "* The phrasing like \"the relationship between traditional style (LIWC-style) and sensorial style\" may not be accurate. They are not totally independent, and LIWC-style includes categories that can capture aspects of sensory style.\n* Apart from applying SVD to the BERT embedding, have the authors considered freezing some layers of the model while only training a few layers? Or other parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA? These methods are natural to think about and could provide a valuable basis for experimental comparison.\n* This paper lacks the recognition of other works to provide a better academic background of the study. There has been some relevant work on using sensorial style together with other dimension of linguistic style for text analysis (https://doi.org/10.1080/09296174.2017.1405719, https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1979742.1979614), and there are also other recent works on improving LLMs' understanding of diverse linguistic style using lexicon (https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.740/). It would be beneficial to cite and discuss these works to highlight the differences from them and contextualize the findings.\n* The structure of the sections, particularly Section 4, appears disorganized and rushed. It may be beneficial for the author to consider reorganizing them for better clarity.\n* The analysis in Section 4 seems superficial. It mainly focuses on the grouping of LIWC features and how these groups manifest in different text genres. However, it does not show how these categories might affect the personal engagement with sensorial description."

                "value": "* In Section 4.1 (table 1), how were the sensorial sentences extracted from each of the original datasets? How were sensorial words annotated?\n* The footnote and Figure 2 caption in page 7 are vague.\n* What are training details of Figure 4? For example, what is the learning rate of BERT? Did the authors explore hyperparameter tuning? Given the concern that BERT may be overparameterized (as also mentioned in paper), adjusting hyperparameters could significantly affect its performance."

It was only later that I saw some machine learning.\n\nEven so, genre and style are very different things.  It isn't clear to me that the proposed method is really capturing either.  I would feel happier with more modest claims suggesting that it is worth taking genre more seriously than many LLMs do.  I think you have a convincing case for the more modest conclusions.\n\nIt is a shame that Figure 2 falls on top of footnote 2.  The page break doesn't work well with the wrapped figure.\n\nFigure 2 is hard to read.  Please don't use less than 8pt fonts.  I'm not sure what I am supposed to take-away from figure 2 and figure 3.  I get that different genres are different.  Is there more to be said than that.  Would it help to embed the genres in latent dimensions and show scatter plots of the first few latent dimensions?   As I recall, Biber did quite a bit of work like that.  It would be good to reformulate that way of thinking using more modern methods."

Drawing inspiiration from cognition theory, the paper models sensory stylometry as a combination of traditional stylometry dimensions. Further, this is modelled using a Reduced Rank Ridge Regression formulation - where each \"sensorial\" sentence is modelled as a low-ranked weighted combination of the tradtional style dimension. To extend to non-linear mappings, masked LLM representation is used instead of the direct encoding - allowing for complex relations to be captured. Experiments indicate that this is better than directly using BERT representations, while having lesser parameters."

For example, the introduction of the paper can include a few examples that establish what is sensory stylometry - this will help establish the problem better.  \n2) The paper grounds its observations on a lot of quantitative evaluation, which is severely limiting given the qualitative nature of the task.
