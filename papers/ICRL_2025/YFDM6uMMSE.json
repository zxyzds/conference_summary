    "title": "EMOE: Expansive Matching of Experts for Robust Uncertainty Based Rejection",
    "abstract": "Expansive Matching of Experts (EMOE) is a novel method that utilizes support-expanding, extrapolatory pseudo-labeling to improve prediction and uncertainty based rejection on out-of-distribution (OOD) points. We propose an expansive data augmentation technique that generates OOD instances in a latent space, and an empirical trial based approach to filter out augmented expansive points for pseudo-labeling. EMOE utilizes a diverse set of multiple base experts as pseudo-labelers on the  augmented data to improve OOD performance through a shared MLP with multiple heads (one per expert). We demonstrate that EMOE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both image and tabular data.",

It should show multi-stage training and emphasize the difference between experts and heads. Fig.2 is also not informative, you can consider visualizing the selection on Alg.2. For eq.2-9, please clarify the meaning of g(x) nearby. Currently, g(x) is only shown in 165-167, which makes readers hard to understand these equations. Also, please include math symbols in Alg.1 as your paper defines.\n\nThe experiment part is poor. Even the number of experts and the impact of $L_{mean}$ is not verified in experiments.\n\nPlease give a clear definition of your problem at the beginning part of the method section. Besides, please clarify what is the meaning of distribution shift here. For example, distribution shifts can be covariate shifts in domain generalization or semantic shifts in out-of-distribution detection."

Meanwhile, the requirement of multiple experts also increases the computation complexity of the proposed method.\n\n+ The experiments are conducted on simple MLP-based architecture. It would be better that the authors follow [1] and conduct experiments on the more powerful network architecture. For example, the empirical results in [1] show that most domain generalization methods fail to outperform the vanilla baseline when hyperparameters are carefully tuned based on the ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 architectures. It would be beneficial to adopt the network architecture and experimental settings from [1] for the PACS dataset to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n[1] In Search of Lost Domain Generalization"

This could help the readers better understand the effectiveness and the limitations of the proposed method.\n\n+ What is the value of 'k,' the number of experts used in the experiments? Is the rejection ability sensitive to the number of experts?\n\n+ The paper primarily focuses on single-domain generalization scenarios. However, it is more common for training data to come from multiple domains. Another question is whether the proposed method can effectively generalize to multi-domain scenarios. Take PACS dataset as an example, the authors can take three domains from photo, art painting cartoon and sketch as the training data and the left one as the test set."

It does not help the paper to show its potential. \n- In Section 3.3, the L1 loss for classification is not well motivated. It should be argued why it makes sense to use it for the classification task, e.g. strong regularisation based on the literature. \n- Line 178, the reference to \"general data\" adds ambiguity to the understanding of the approach.
