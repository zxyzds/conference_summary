    "abstract": "The most basic form of a rigid object is a cloud of unordered points, for example, a set of corners or other salient features. The rigid shape of a point cloud in the Euclidean plane is its SE(2)-equivalence class under rigid motion (a composition of translations and rotations). We introduce complete invariants (with no false negatives, no false positives) and a bi-Lipschitz continuous metric that satisfies all axioms, provides a 1-1 matching between points in clouds, and is computable in a quadratic time of the number $m$ of points.  The realizability property implies that the space of all rigid clouds is efficiently parametrized by vectorial invariants like geographic coordinates. The new invariants justified that any of 130K+ molecules in the QM9 database is uniquely determined by the rigid shape of its atomic cloud.",

                "value": "This paper introduces an invariant and metric for unordered point clouds in the Euclidean plane, designed to meet specific desirable properties. The invariant is complete, ensuring that two point clouds related by a rigid transform can be uniquely matched. It is also realizable, enabling the reconstruction of the point cloud from the invariant up to an unknown rigid transform. The metric is Lipschitz continuous, meaning that bounded perturbations in the point cloud result in bounded changes in the distances between the invariants. Additionally, it guarantees that two close invariants correspond to point clouds that can be matched through a rigid motion, with a small Euclidean distance between matching points. Both the invariant and the metric are computable in polynomial time.\n\nThe paper includes experiments in chemistry using a publicly available dataset, demonstrating the method\u2019s ability to identify closely related molecules based on the positions of their atom centers."

In addition, the invariant is proven to have several other desired properties, such as bi-directional Lipschitz continuity and efficient ways to compute both directions of the mapping as well as and an approximate rigid motion for point-clouds that are close to being equivalent.\nThe requirements of the invariant are stated in a main Problem, followed by a detailed construction, with full proofs for the claimed properties (in the appendix).\nAn experimental section focuses on analyzing a large-scale dataset of 3D molucule structures, with the focus being on differentiating the proposed NDP from previous invariants (which are generally much faster to compute, but are not complete - i.e. they might map non-equivalent clouds to a single point)."

Writing is very accurate, but at the same time accessible to non-experts. \n2] I believe that the new characterization (in Problem 1.1) of the conditions required from the parameterization captures different desired properties of such invariants in a good way, including the addition of properties like 'point-matching' and 'realizability' that were lacking in previous definitions. This definition, includes some properties, which were not demonstrated to be useful, but might be so in different applications. Especially, the bi-directional continuity, which gives a type of smoothness that might be useful for settings where one is interested with approximate forms of equivalence.\n3] The discussions and examples for the 2D case of m=3 (triangles) and m=4 (quads) is very helpful for understanding both the limitations of previous work as well as the specifics of the construction, including very good visualizations.\n4] The experiment is very original and interesting. It is done in a clever way, by hierarchically classifying pairs as being different, by gradually increasing the quality of the invariant. It is nicely shown on data that is real, even though not including measurement noise, with true new conclusions (that I presume were unknown) that could not be made using the reference techniques."

                "value": "1] While the suggested parameterization is an elegant mathematical result, with clear progress made, it's applicability is still questionable. Computationally, quadratic complexity is clearly prohibitive, for most cases of 'point-clouds', or general n-dimensional sets (e.g. of features). Perhaps the focus should have been more on the computational sides of the problem. I would also argue that the *completeness* of the invariance is rarely relevant when dealing with real data, unless it is the case of differentiating between exact\\inexact copies. On the other hand, the Lipschitz bi-continuity could be a key property for dealing with the inexact versions of the problem, which are much more general and common. Think of point-clouds that have noise-measurement, or that have resulted from different ways of sampling. Furthermore, such distaces could be used to measure the difference between discretely sampled disributions, under optimal alignment.\n2] In the same lines, the experiment focuses on demonstrating the advantage of being a complete invariant, but does not analyze the advantages of having the other properties. I understand that the theory wasn't fully developed in such directions (e.g. assuming equal number of points), but it would have been useful to empirically demonstrate the merits of the invariant in other ways, even under controlled synthetic experiments.\n3] There is a lack in addressing how the proposed idea could be beneficial for the more common tasks that are performed on unordered point-clouds, such as: alignment (perhaps with noise or partial overlap), classification, detection, segmentation and even generative modeling.\n\nSome typos/mistakes:\n* Wrong referencing, e.g. in lines 81 and 86\n* bipartute (line 321)\n* 'one four pairs' (line 336)\n* sayss (line 411)"

Is there a principled way the you would suggest? The 'hierarchical' way used seems to only be suitable for the particular case of classifying data by exact equivalence (where the cheaper invariants provide fast 'rejection'). \n2] It is claimed in the experiment that the NDP provides best seperation. Is there any evidence that the metric on it is well aligned with what would be considered a good measure for the distance from being equivalent (under rigid transformation)? Have you tried testing how it looks when starting from perfect equivalence and degrading in different ways (such as noise in the points, or non-perfect rigidity)?\n3] Computation wise - Are there relaxations with major gains that could make the approach more practical?

                "value": "The paper addresses the problem of the exact matching of full (not partially observed, as in e.g. CV/LIDAR data) point clouds. It proposes a descriptor (NDP/NCP) that can uniquely identifies a specific point cloud and from which a unique point cloud can be reconstructed, as well as a distance metric (NBM) between point clouds that permits exact identification and is proven to be Lipschitz-smooth. The descriptor requires set matching for point cloud matching though - it cannot be directly compared by comparing descriptor vectors. The main paper discusses the 2D case; general dimensions (as well as all of the proofs) are presented in the appendix.\n\nThe writing of the paper is quite technical, so I might be missing something important somewhere. To the best of my understanding, the whole method hinges on the well-known fact that one needs only $d$ point-to-point correspondences (with linearly independent difference vectors) to fix a rigid mapping in $d$ dimensions (because a rigid coordinate frame can be derived from these), which makes searching for correspondences under rigid mappings much easier than general correspondence problems.\n\nNaively, one could fix one reference point (e.g., the center of mass) and try correspondences between one (in 2D, two in 3D, etc.) of the source and every single target points (in 2D, all possible pairs in 3D, etc.) to find the mapping and efficiently check whether the clouds match. The complexity is polynomial for each fixed $d$ and exponential in $d$.\n\nThe paper exploits this mathematical fact (not sure if implicitly or explicitly) and builds systematically enumerates all coordinate frames in a single point cloud by using the center of mass and every point in the cloud as correspondences. The center of mass must match, thus only all other points have to be considered. It projects into the coordinate system induced by the difference to the center (scaled by the length of this vector to maintain smoothness) and then enumerates all of the points, giving an $O(n^2)$ representation of $n$ points (there are $O(n)$ coordinate frames with $O(n)$ entries each). The descriptor is then the set of the set of points. By comparing these via set-matching, exact matches can be found in polynomial time. \n\nTo compute distances, a cascade of two perfect bi-partite graph matching steps is used to first reconstruct a good ordering of the rotated and scaled copies of the point cloud and then match their points as much as possible. The paper states a theorem and provides a proof for Lipschitz-continuity of this process (which involves discrete decisions).\n\nFinally, the paper shows some examples of comparing point clouds using the QM-9 data set as an example."

It also provides examples to illustrate the challenges of distance-based rigidity.\nIf my understanding of the method outlined above is correct, I would also see the method as in its core rather straightforward and easy to understand, which increases confidence in correctness and might make it easier to implement the ideas in other contexts."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My understanding of potential weaknesses hinges upon my understanding of the method as a whole; as the paper is technical and extensive, I might be misunderstanding something.\n\nA major restriction of the submission is its focus on exact matching of full point clouds, excluding partially acquired data and significant outlier issues, both of which is very common in practical handling of, for example, 3D point clouds acquired from real-world scenes (for cases like molecular data bases, such as QM-9, this restriction probably does not matter). The exact matching is relaxed by providing a continuous metric, but partial matching still remains impossible. The method is also restricted to rigid motions, and due the exponential costs in $d$, it can only be realistically applied to low-dimensional data.\n\nI think that the exact matching algorithm, which is described first, is not very useful: First, it is not new - guessing a small number of point-wise correspondences, e.g. via RANSAC or randomized forward-search, and then verifying the match is an established technique, see e.g. [Huang et al., Reassembling Fractured Objects by Geometric Matching, Siggraph 2006], which is already robust to deteriorated and partial data. Second, it requires a large amount of memory (squared the number of input points) and accordingly significant runtimes, which can be avoided by not storing the intermediate results and using heuristics filters in matching candidates (such as Huang et al.'s and many similar papers), as well as by implicitly excluding impossible matching candidates (see e.g. 4PCS-Matching [Aiger et al., Siggraph 2008]).\n\nThe continuous metric, on the other hand, is a bit more interesting. While the basic procedure (using bi-partite graph matching to find the closest matching points) seems again to be a canonical path for comparing full point clouds, the design of two nested matching procedures does not appear very straightforward, and the smoothness guarantees obtain in that way might be appealing in applications where such a tool is needed. Unfortunately, I have not been able to verify the formal proof, but the intuitively, the I would assume that this should work (as nearest points change discretely, but only at points where distances coincide, thus plausibly maintaining smoothness).\n\nThe writing of the paper could be improved. While I would see the strive for a formal treatment positively, the paper in its current form, to a reader like me (different people have of course different inclinations to intuition vs. abstraction) seems to obscure the main ideas behind formal details to much. Then, the appendix, where a lot of the most interesting contributions reside (such as proofs of the theorems), is even harder to parse. For example, I was looking the proof of Theorem 3.5, where I would see a minor technical difficulty but could only find a treatment of a much more general statement in arbitrary dimensions, which made it very difficult to verify the statements made in the paper. In my perception, one could reorganize and rephrase the text to make everything much more accessible. Overall, I have to say that I was not able to read and understand much of the appendix in its current form (maybe fellow reviewers who were able to can give a better assessment of the overall work).\n\nFinally, I see a small technical issue in Theorem 3.5: The representation computed for the NDP/NCP descriptors consists of a set of matrices (in a tuple with the base-point distance), which are compared by equality. The matrices are descriped as unordered in terms of the ordering of the 2D points (after projection, which is of course ordered by the two coordinate axes). Comparing sets then implicitly matches the unordered matrices, restoring correspondences between rearranged points. However, within the matrices, a \"standard\" equality / comparison would perform a column-wise comparison, which matches points in the specified order, which can differ between point clouds A and B to be matched. I think that here, again, a set comparison rather than a column-wise matrix comparision would be required. The continuous metric uses two nested linear assignment / bi-partite graph matching steps, the inner one corresponding to such a (soft) set matching here.\n\nOverall, I think that the paper is (most likely, limited by my ability to follow the appendix and some remaining doubts wrt. potential misunderstandings) correct in essence and solves the problem that it states. However, the conceptual step over known work seems a bit narrow to me (given the limited setup and that we do not get vector-valued invariants but only an encoding of point matching / finding of closest points in mathematical language), potentially with the exception of proving continuity. However, that part was hard to understand. The set of practical problems that can be solved with the new proposal but not with already known methods also seems to be limited (in particular given the large costs). The problem statement also seems to be to some degree tangential to the focus of ICLR.\n\nFor these reasons, I am somewhat skeptical of the suitability of the submission for ICLR."
