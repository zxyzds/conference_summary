    "title": "PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "The crystal structure can be simplified as a periodic point set repeating across the entire three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, methods for representing crystals rely on descriptors like lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups to characterize the structure. However, in reality, atoms in material always vibrate above absolute zero, causing continuous fluctuations in their positions. This dynamic behavior disrupts the underlying periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under even slight perturbations. To this end, chemists proposed the Pairwise Distance Distribution (PDD) method, which has been used to distinguish all periodic structures in the world's largest real materials collection, the Cambridge Structural Database. However, achieving the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, resulting in high computational costs. Moreover, it does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to directly apply PDD to crystal material property prediction tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) for the first time, incorporating them into the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. Based on this, we further developed WPDDFormer and UPDDFormer, graph transformer architecture constructed using WPDD and UPDD crystal graphs. We demonstrate that this method maintains the continuity and completeness of crystal graphs even under slight perturbations in atomic positions. Moreover, by modeling PDD as global information and integrating it into matrix-based message passing, we significantly reduced computational costs. Comprehensive evaluation results show that WPDDFormer achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across tasks on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT.",

However, the completeness claim of the proposed representation is problematic, as it relies on the assumption that \"the PDD is a generally complete invariant\" (citing Widdowson & Kurlin, 2022), asserting that distinct crystal structures yield distinct PDD representations. This claim is not accurate. The PDD matrix does not ensure completeness for unstable crystal structures and fails to distinguish between chiral crystal structures. Furthermore, the proposed UPDD crystal graph construction method was previously introduced in \"Zeoformer: Coarse-Grained Periodic Graph Transformer for OSDA-Zeolite Affinity Prediction,\" and the message-passing layers draw inspiration from ComFormer. Given these issues, the paper has limited technical contributions and several potentially misleading claims."

                "value": "1. Incomplete and Potentially Misleading Claims about Completeness\n\nThe completeness proof in the paper relies on the assumption that the PDD matrix acts as a generally complete invariant for distinguishing different crystal structures. However, this is inaccurate. The PDD matrix is not guaranteed to distinguish unstable crystal structures and cannot differentiate between chiral crystal structures, indicating limitations in the claimed theoretical foundation.  Action suggested: reorganize the proof writing section or reorganize the completeness claims.\n\n2. Limited Novelty in Crystal Graph Construction\n\nThe proposed UPDD crystal graph construction method is not novel and has been previously introduced in the work \"Zeoformer: Coarse-Grained Periodic Graph Transformer for OSDA-Zeolite Affinity Prediction.\" This overlap with prior work limits the novelty and originality of the proposed approach. Action suggested: check this previous work and discuss similarity and difference with it.\n\n3. Message Passing Layers Largely Derived from ComFormer\n\nThe architecture of the message passing layers appears to be inspired by ComFormer, which further limits the technical novelty and contribution of the proposed method. Could you highlight any novel aspects or improvements in your approach compared to ComFormer?\n\nIn summary, while this paper proposes a method for generating geometrically complete and invariant crystal representations, its theoretical claims regarding completeness are flawed, and the approach itself relies heavily on prior work, both in graph construction and in network architecture. The combination of these issues limits the paper\u2019s contributions and justifies a rejection at this stage."
