    "title": "A simulation-heuristics dual-process model for intuitive physics",
    "abstract": "The role of mental simulation in human behavior for various physical tasks is widely acknowledged, attributed to the generality of Intuitive Physics Engine (IPE). However, it remains unclear whether mental simulation is consistently employed across scenarios of different simulation costs and where its boundary is. Moreover, cognitive strategies beyond these boundaries have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we adopted a pouring-marble task containing various conditions to study IPE's limits and strategies beyond. A human study revealed two distinct error patterns in predicting the pouring angle, differentiated by the simulation time using a boundary. This suggests a possible switching of the underlying reasoning strategies. Our initial experiment on IPE showed that its correlation with human judgments diminished in scenarios requiring extended time of simulation. This observation prompted the exploration of an alternative mechanism based on heuristics for intuitive physics. We uncovered that a linear heuristic model, relying exclusively on empirical data, replicated human prediction more accurately when the simulation time exceeded a certain boundary. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new framework, Simulation-Heuristics Model (SHM), which conceptualizes intuitive physics as a dual process: IPE is predominant only in short-time simulation, whereas a heuristics-based approach is applied as IPE's simulation time extends beyond the simulation boundary. The SHM model aligns more precisely with human behavior across various scenarios and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities under different conditions. Crucially, SHM integrates computational methods previously viewed as separate into a unified model, quantitatively studying their switching mechanism.",

There are two issues here - I don't think physical simulations can be represented using a quartic equation. Were other heuristic models considered? Additionally, deciding on the time threshold after which the heuristic should kick in requires having a hold out validation set. How was this done with having only 43 participants?"

What was the objective being maximized? Further on in the paper, the authors state \u201cA grid search identified the boundary of 68.2 degrees in simulation time and a dynamic positional noise of 0.2 as optimal for mirroring human judgments.\" Does this mean that the Simulation-Heuristics Model is fit to the human data? If so, are there separate cohorts for model fitting and model comparison? \n\n- I don\u2019t understand the newly proposed heuristic model. As stated in the paper, previous work in heuristic models use predefined rules or fit to human data. In this paper, the heuristic model is fit to simulation data. How is this an accurate representation of human heuristics since humans haven\u2019t seen the examples this model has. \n\n- Considering this was only tested on a single problem (pouring), it seems premature to claim this as a general model for resource efficient physics prediction. If correct, we would see this behavior replicated across a variety of tasks using some unified notion of a computational budget. Time is also not a very good proxy for simulation difficulty.\n\n- The authors report correlations and RMSE for different models (Heuristic, IPE, SHM), but I couldn't find any statistical tests that compared these models.\n\n- Would the findings in this paper not be consistent with a biased heuristic or simulation model? Is there any reason a miscalibrated physics simulation that got the friction, mass, etc parameters wrong wouldn\u2019t also lead to angle-dependent prediction error?\n\n- In figure 1c, red is used for both the mean angle estimate and the A-shape points. This was confusing at first glance.\n\n- No code is provided, which limits reproducibility."
