    "title": "BrainSF: A Foundation Model for Whole Brain Functional Signals Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Foundational models hold significant potential for advancing brain function research, particularly with recent technological advancements enabling the capture of spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. However, existing methods are primarily limited to characterizing observed brain signals and cannot infer continuous future signals\u2014an essential component for understanding the brain's causal structure and its role in various cognitive states. Current research leaves a substantial gap in forecasting whole-brain signal sequences. To address this, we propose a self-supervised model that embeds momentary whole-brain fMRI signals into vector representations and predicts continuous future signals. Our model is trained on a large-scale fMRI dataset, encompassing both resting-state and naturalistic stimuli conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the model performs effectively in zero-shot forecasting of future whole-brain signals on unseen data and excels in downstream tasks such as task-based functional state decoding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to forecast and model whole-brain signals at such a large scale. The experimental results validate the feasibility of our method, offering new directions for theoretical research on brain signal time series and potential applications in diagnosing and treating brain disorders.",

                "value": "1 - The paper lacks clear organization, particularly in the Methods section, which requires a more detailed description of the model architecture to enable thorough evaluation.\n\n2 - Given the brain's dynamic complexity and inherent chaotic behavior, foundational models should include mechanisms for capturing uncertainty in time-series data, such as using variational encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence modeling or incorporating partial differential equation (PDE) terms in the loss function for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The proposed approach, however, does not address this crucial aspect.\n\n3 - The abstract claims that the authors propose a self-supervised model to embed whole-brain fMRI signals into vector representations for continuous future prediction. However, the Methods section indicates the use of 1,000 parcels, which suggests a misalignment between the stated objective and actual implementation.\n\n4 - The paper lacks a dedicated interpretability section.\n\n5 - The reported generalization metrics ($R^2 , R, MSE$) require contextualization; how do we know they are good?\n\n6 - The computational complexity of the model is significant, as highlighted in Section 3.3."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1 - How many learnable parameters does the model contain? My primary concern is that the network architecture appears relatively modest in size for a foundational model, which could restrict its representational capacity.\n\n2 - In Section 3.1, it is stated that \"BrainSF takes as input a parcellated BOLD sequence $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times N}$\". If $T$ represents the number of time points and $N$ denotes the number of parcels, what is the voxel count within each parcel?\n\n3 - Could you provide additional details regarding the model architecture to enhance clarity and understanding?\n\n4 - The proposed method mentions the utilization of 1,000 parcels. What is the rationale behind employing parcels instead of using the entire 4D tensor as input to the model?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- A primary concern is the lack of baseline comparisons in this study. Although the authors claim that this is the only work addressing the fMRI forecasting problem, prior fMRI foundation models, such as BrainLM (Ortega Caro et al., 2023), which employs masked-prediction training, can also perform forecasting by placing the mask over the prediction segment. Additionally, the forecasting horizon in this study (up to 30 TR) aligns with the sequence length used in BrainLM (200 TR, if recalled correctly). The authors' rationale for not including a comparison with BrainLM is unclear.\n\n- This absence of baselines raises a second concern: the model architecture used in this paper appears somewhat antiquated techniques. Without comparisons to other models, there is no evidence that the current methodology is more effective or novel for fMRI forecasting compared to contemporary time-series forecasting architectures. Beyond the MAE architecture previously applied to fMRI data, numerous advanced time-series forecasting models could be potential baselines that could be evaluated on fMRI data, such as those available in the \u201cTime-Series Library\u201d repository (https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/tree/main).\n\n- The study does not address the influence of fMRI auto-correlation, a significant factor in fMRI forecasting. Typically, fMRI signals exhibit auto-correlation across a time lag of approximately -10 to 10 seconds, potentially making short-term forecasting within this range easier. In this study, the forecasting horizon for Table 1 is set to 15 TR, which largely falls within this auto-correlation window. While this does not imply an issue with the methodology itself, it would be valuable to examine prediction performance when introducing a gap between the input and forecasting time windows to reduce the effects of auto-correlation. At a minimum, the authors should discuss this factor, as it plays an important role in fMRI forecasting task."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- The authors claim an innovative approach in modeling \"whole-brain\" activity. In this context, I anticipated predictions at the voxel level (providing high spatial resolution) or, at a minimum, coverage of both cortical and subcortical regions. However, this study continues to utilize cortical parcellations to convert the fMRI 4D volume into ROI-by-time time series, similar to existing studies, though with an increased number of parcellations. Since prior studies also covered the entire cortical region, this terminology appears somewhat misleading. Could the authors further clarify the specific distinctions in preprocessing or model design that differentiate this study as \"whole-brain,\" and explain why this study is considered \"whole-brain\" while others are not?\n- For line 214, and line 265, is there any rationale behind the choice of 0.3 for the prediction portion? \n- For Figure 2, could the authors specify which regions are shown as examples? Adding clarifications in either the text or figure captions would be helpful."
