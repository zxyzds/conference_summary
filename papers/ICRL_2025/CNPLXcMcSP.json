    "abstract": "This paper studies the computational challenges of attention-based models in artificial intelligence by introducing innovative sampling methods to accelerate attention computation in large language models (LLM). Inspired by the recent progress of LLM in real-life applications, we introduces a streaming sampler question for attention setting. Our approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional attention mechanisms while maintaining or enhancing model performance. We demonstrate these methods' effectiveness from theoretical perspective, including space, update time. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability and broad applicability across various model architectures and domains.",

                "value": "In recent years, artificial intelligence has experienced a paradigm shift with the advent of attention-based models, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision. At the core of these models is the attention mechanism, which enhances deep learning networks by focusing on relevant parts of the input data for more nuanced processing. However, as these models grow in size and complexity, the computational demands of the attention mechanism increase exponentially, posing challenges in efficiency and scalability. Traditional attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer models, require quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, which hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments and limits real-time processing capabilities. Additionally, the high computational cost increases the environmental impact due to higher energy consumption. This paper introduces innovative sampling methods to accelerate attention computation in deep learning models by strategically sampling key elements from the input data, thereby reducing computational overhead while maintaining or enhancing performance."

The authors should have conducted comparative experiments demonstrating the performance and computational costs with and without their proposed methods on these widely-used models.\n3.

For real-world deployment, it is crucial to understand how these sampling methods perform under stress conditions and when processing corrupted data.\n\nThe absence of computational experiments to validate the paper's core claims is particularly concerning.
