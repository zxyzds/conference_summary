    "title": "Provable Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model for POMDPs",
    "abstract": "A major challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world scenarios is managing high-dimensional, noisy perception input signals. Identifying and utilizing representations that contain sufficient and essential information for decision-making tasks is key to computational efficiency and generalization of RL by reducing bias in decision-making processes. In this paper, we present a new RL framework, named *Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CSR-ADM)*, which accommodates and enhances any RL algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with perturbed inputs. A new asynchronous diffusion model is proposed to denoise both reward and observation spaces, and integrated with the bisimulation technology to capture causal state representations in POMDPs. Notably, the causal state is the coarsest partition of the denoised observations. We link the causal state to a causal feature set and provide theoretical guarantees by deriving the upper bound on value function approximation between the noisy observation space and the causal state space, demonstrating equivalence to bisimulation under the Lipschitz assumption. To the best of our knowledge, CSR-ADM is the first framework to approximate causal states with diffusion models, substantiated by a comprehensive theoretical foundation. Extensive experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CSR-ADM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving the robustness of existing RL algorithms under varying scales of random noise.",

Intuitively, the algorithm uses both a denoise model and a bisimulation metric to find 'causal state representations' for a given observation, which can be used by off-the-shelf RL algorithms to compute policies. The authors provide a sub-optimality bound for their method under some (reasonable) assumptions on the dynamics of the environment. Empirically, the authors show that incorporating their method into SAC improves performance and outperforms methods that only consider denoising or finding causal representations."

Can two states give the same observation?\n* In eq. 1, $f$ denotes the observation function. However, in Def. 1 and in Assumption 2, $f$ is also used to denote something that looks like an observation function but has a different number of inputs. How do these relate?\n* $\\zeta$ is overloaded in a confusing way: it is used to describe the predicted state (line 234), the noisy state (line 269), as well as the bisimulation model (Alg 1, line 2). Do these all represent the same thing?\n* In Eqs. 7 and 8 and Alg 1, $\\theta$ and $\\zeta$ seem to be switched. Is this a typo?\n* After eq. 6, the paper mentions a variables $n$, $\\hat{s}_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$. What do these refer to?\n* In Alg. 1, what is the function of line 7? What do we use the sampled transitions for?\n* In line 297, how can the diffusion model predict a future state? I thought it only removed noise?\n* In Assumption 3, what does this assumption intuitively mean? Are $s_i, s_j \\in S$, or in $S \\cup O$ ?\n* I do not understand Thm 1: it seems to me that if we pick $c_T \\approx 0$ and $c_R \\approx 1$, then any states that have the same immediate reward would have a value gap of $\\approx 0$ as well, which clearly is not the case. Can you explain why it holds?\n* In Fig 4 (App. A), how is $P(\\hat{s}_t|o_t)$ computed? I thought this was what the diffusion model was used for."

It is also not clear why there is a partition of the state space into the observation space.\n\n2. Definition 2/Assumption 3 seems to define the bisimulation metric in terms of a fixed-point equation.
