    "abstract": "Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks (PE-GNNs) are a leading approach for modeling continuous spatial data. However, they often fail to produce calibrated predictive distributions, limiting their effectiveness for uncertainty quantification. We introduce the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel method that integrates PE-GNNs, Quantile Neural Networks, and recalibration techniques in a fully nonparametric framework, requiring minimal assumptions about the predictive distributions. We propose a new network architecture that, when combined with a quantile-based loss function, yields accurate and reliable probabilistic models without increasing computational complexity. Our approach provides a flexible, robust framework for conditional density estimation, applicable beyond spatial data contexts. We further introduce a structured method for incorporating a KNN predictor into the model while avoiding data leakage through the GNN layer operation. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PE-GQNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.",

PMLR, 2022.\n\n   Additionally, using KNN-Graph with geographic coordinates has been proposed and widely applied in different domains:\n   - \"Dynamic graph CNN for learning on point clouds.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 38.5 (2019): 1-12.\n   -  \"Spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks for earthquake source characterization.\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 127.11 (2022): e2022JB024401.\n\n3. PE-GNN does not claim the method as SOTA. So which baseline are considered as SOTA in this submission? PE-GNN is better than GNN but not the SOTA.

The real-world geographic data usually collect in a temporal manner, so how does the data is separated into different train/val/test segments?
