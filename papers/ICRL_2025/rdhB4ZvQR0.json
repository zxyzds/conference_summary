    "title": "Rethinking Graph Super-Resolution: Dual Frameworks for Topological Fidelity",
    "abstract": "Graph super-resolution is an underexplored yet highly relevant research direction that circumvents the need for costly and time-consuming data collection, preparation, and storage. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. Existing work on graph super-resolution leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and achieves impressive results. However, we note two major limitations in the current model design: (1) It violates the underlying graph structure when increasing the number of nodes, and (2) it relies heavily on node representation learning, which has limited capacity to accurately model edges. To address these limitations, we propose two novel frameworks: (1) Bi-SR, which performs structure-aware node super-resolution, and (2) DEFEND, which focuses on edge representation learning for enhanced edge modeling. We supplement our work with rigorous theoretical analysis and conduct extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets covering diverse graph topologies and low-to-high resolution relationships. The results demonstrate substantial improvements across all experiments, highlighting the potential of both frameworks for graph super-resolution tasks.",

The authors argue that previous methods ignore the underlying structures and fail to learn edge information. To address these issues, this paper proposes Bi-SR and DEFEND for node super-resolution and edge modeling, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over baselines."

However, this paper does not take them into account. In contrast, this paper only uses the basic Linear Algebraic method and autoencoder as baselines, making the experiments unconvincing.\n\n2. This paper proposes two methods, including Bi-SR and DEFEND. However, this relationship between them is not clear. Is there a principle on how to choose the algorithm? Should we use them together or should we use them separately?\n\n3. Although graph super-resolution is a new task, the research on generating graphs with different sizes has been studied for a long time. The representative method is called graphon. Generally, graphon-based methods not only have good theoretical guarantees to preserve structural information but also model the edge distribution. In my view, current issues on graph super-resolution can be well addressed by the advanced graphon methods, such as IGNR [1].\n\n4. The presentation of this paper needs improvement. The notation is confusing and the figures are not in pdf format.\n\n[1] Implicit Graphon Neural Representation. AISTATS 2023."

                "value": "This work focuses on generating high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) graphs. The authors propose two methods, Bi-SR and DEFEND, both using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the foundational structure. Bi-SR constructs a bipartite graph that connects nodes between the LR and HR graphs. It randomly initializes the HR node features, and then uses a message-passing on the bipartite graph to refine the HR node features. These features are subsequently refined through another intra-graph message-passing on the HR graph nodes. This refinement process uses either full-graph message passing on HR nodes or a learned structure specifically for HR message passing. The DEFEND model, on the other hand, focuses on edge representation learning by performing message passing on the line graph of the original graph, treating edges as nodes. The methods are evaluated on synthetic graphs and a brain graph dataset."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Clarity and Writing Issues**  \n   The paper has several writing issues that make it difficult to follow. For example, Section 2.4 starts with \"However, this method disrupts structural integrity...\" without clarifying what \"this method\" refers to. This paragraph closely resembles the third paragraph in the same subsection, possibly due to editing issues. Overall, the story and motivation in each section do not flow smoothly, making it hard to understand how different parts connect.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Motivation for High-Resolution Graphs**  \n   The motivation for using high-resolution graphs, especially for general graphs, is unclear. The reviewer, unfamiliar with brain activity analysis, found it challenging to grasp the value of high-resolution graphs for general applications. Without a compelling use case in brain graph datasets, the motivation for this approach seems weak for broader graph applications.\n\n3. **Reinventing Existing Concepts**  \n   The paper introduces well-known concepts as if they are novel. For instance, the \"dual graph\" discussed here corresponds to the line graph, which has been widely used in previous GNN research [1, 2].\n\n4. **Inaccurate Mathematical Language**  \n   Propositions and corollaries should use precise mathematical language. Phrases like \"this method is more effective\" lack rigor, as \"more effective\" is not a mathematically defined term, leading to an unclear use of formal notation.\n\n5. **Limited Real-World Application**  \n   The paper only uses one real-world graph dataset, and the broader applications of this method remain unclear to the reviewer.\n\n6. **High Computational Complexity**  \n   The method seems computationally expensive, requiring a full bipartite graph, a fully connected high-resolution graph, and a dual graph from the fully connected graph. However, the paper lacks an analysis of the time and memory complexity of this approach.\n\n7. **Unclear Experimental Setup and Evaluation Metrics**  \n   The experimental setup and evaluation metrics are not well-defined. For instance, it's unclear how Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is measured when multiple valid permutations of the high-resolution graph could exist, making it a potential graph isomorphism problem. Calculating edge-wise MAE without addressing permutation invariance does not seem to be a valid evaluation approach.\n\n8. **Non-standard Definition of MPNNs**  \n   Section 2.3 defines MPNNs in a non-standard way. The message function could be more complex, potentially including edge features and non-linear combinations of previous layer embeddings.\n\n----------\n **Minor Points**:\n- In Equation (4), the term $\\mathbf{A}_f^{ref}$ is repeated twice.\n- Line 152: \"violets\" should be corrected to \"violates.\"\n\n----------\n[1] Cai, L., et al. \"Line graph neural networks for link prediction.\" *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* 44.9 (2021): 5103-5113.  \n[2] Chen, Z., Li, X., & Bruna, J. \"Supervised community detection with line graph neural networks.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.08415* (2017)."

                "value": "1. Could you explain more about the experimental setup and how your evaluation metric accounts for permutations of the nodes in the HR graph?\n2. What are other potential applications of this method beyond brain analysis?\n3. How can the HR graph be useful for downstream tasks? High-resolution images make sense for human visual systems, but graphs are not typically analyzed visually. For a computational system, theoretically, performing a task such as classification on the LR graph should be equivalent to first learning the HR graph and then performing the downstream task on it."

Is it computationally feasible to create all-pair connections between the $n_l$ and $n_h$ nodes in Eq. (3)?\n4. I\u2019m not certain why we need the refinement step in Section 3.1, since the operation seems very similar to the super-resolution, which we aim to do eventually.\n5. In Section 3.2, why do the authors use graph transformers instead of more lightweight and efficient graph neural networks?\n6. How can we prove Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 if the terms like \u201cedge space\u201d and \u201cmore effective\u201d are not properly defined?"
