    "title": "Scalable Benchmarking and Robust Learning for Noise-Free Ego-Motion and 3D Reconstruction from Noisy Video",
    "abstract": "We aim to advance the reconstruction of noise-free ego-motion and photorealistic 3D scenes from noise-free to noisy video inputs. To achieve this, we address three core challenges: scalable data generation, comprehensive  benchmarking, and  model robustness enhancement.\nFirst, we introduce a scalable noisy data synthesis pipeline capable of generating large-scale, customizable datasets that simulate complex motion, RGB-D sensor corruptions, and synchronization perturbations. Second, we use the  synthesis pipeline to fuel Robust-Ego3D, a large-scale benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate model robustness under a wide range of perturbations, providing a challenging testbed for advancing model performance.\nOur extensive experimental evaluations and theoretical analyses reveal a critical limitation of learning-based models: while they perform remarkably well on clean, noise-free benchmarks, they exhibit significant degradation in ego-motion accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality under dynamic motion and imaging noise. Third, to address these challenges, we propose Correspondence-guided Gaussian Splatting (CorrGS). CorrGS employs a progressively updated, clean internal 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, which is rendered into RGB-D frames to establish correspondences with external noisy observations. These correspondences enhance geometric alignment and facilitates appearance restoration learning, enabling robust pose learning and noise-free, photorealistic 3D reconstruction.\nBoth synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate that CorrGS consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving rapid motion. This work establishes a new standard  for stable ego-motion estimation and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse-view, noisy videos under dynamic illumination. We will release our code and benchmark to foster future advancements.",

The authors tackle three core challenges: developing a scalable noisy data generation pipeline, creating the Robust-Ego3D benchmark to evaluate model robustness under varied perturbations, and introducing a novel model called Correspondence guidded Gaussian Splatting. The data generation pipeline is designed to synthesize large scale, customizable   datasets simulating realistic RGBD sensor noise and motion perturbations, which expose vulnerabilities in existing models. With these data, the Robust-Ego3D benchmark allows a systematic robustness evaluation of models across diverse noisy conditions.  CorrGS leverages correspondences between internally generated and observed frames to achieve photorealistic 3D reconstructions and robust pose tracking, significantly outperforming SOTA methods in both synthetic and real world experiments under rapid motion and complex noise."

                "value": "The paper addresses the largely unexplored domain of robustness benchmarking for ego-motion and 3D reconstruction under realistic, noisy conditions. Unlike traditional methods that assume noise-free data, the paper  introduces a customizable pipeline for generating data with varied noise levels, motion deviations, and synchronization perturbations, filling a critical gap in existing SLAM evaluation techniques. Furthermore, CorrGS\u2019s correspondence-based method is innovative, as it maintains a noise-free internal 3D representation while dynamically aligning it with noisy external inputs, a novel approach to handling real-world sensor noise. I believe the authors employ a rigorous methodological framework, incorporating a comprehensive set of experiments across both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. They evaluate CorrGS and other baseline models on metrics including absolute trajectory rrror, PSNR, and depth loss, providing a strong quantitative foundation to support their claims. The ablation studies and theoretical analyses of perturbation effects on model performance offer a clear view of CorrGS's robustness and justify each of the model's components. The paper is clearly structured, with a logical flow from problem definition to solution details. For example, the pipeline for noisy data generation and perturbation taxonomy is visualized in Figure 1, which helps clarify complex processes. Additionally, the explanation of each perturbation type provides readers with a clear understanding of the challenges the benchmark addresses. The ablation studies further aid in understanding the impact of individual components within CorrGS on final model performance."

Depth noise effects are discussed, the authors could delve further into the challenges that depth noise presents in reconstruction. Additional experiments on models\u2019 performance under severe depth noise and missing depth data would strengthen the robustness evaluation and underscore CorrGS's adaptability. The PQV step is essential for their method\u2019s robustness under complex conditions, but the rationale behind its design choices could be explained in greater detail. I believe it would be valuable to know if different loss functions  were tested and if so, why those choices were made. Demonstrating its impact across different noise levels would give a clearer picture of its effectiveness and necessity under varied conditions. The paper primarily compares CorrGS to other dense Neural SLAM models, but additional comparisons with classical non-neural SLAM methods would highlight CorrGS\u2019s improvements in robustness."

The Robust-Ego3D benchmark and CorrGS are tested primarily on indoor or synthetic datasets.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper reads more like a technical report, with an emphasis on experimental results over theoretical analysis or in-depth discussion. While the experiments are thorough, they could benefit from additional interpretive insights that go beyond reporting outcomes. For example, rather than solely presenting quantitative improvements, the authors could analyze why CorrGS outperforms other methods under certain noise conditions, offering more theoretical or practical insights into its advantages.\n\nLack of Contextual Foundation: The abstract and introduction lack a thorough discussion of why noise-free data in current reconstruction models presents a significant limitation. While the paper briefly mentions that models degrade in noisy conditions, it could strengthen its foundation by discussing why these models struggle under real-world noise and how noise impacts reconstruction quality, ego-motion estimation, and mapping accuracy. To improve, the authors should provide an analysis of these limitations with references to studies or examples that highlight the common challenges noise introduces in such models in the introduction section. \n\nThe transition from Problem to Method: The paper transitions too quickly from briefly mentioning the limitations of noise-free models to discussing the proposed pipeline and benchmark, missing an opportunity to underscore the problem\u2019s significance. Expanding on how noise introduces challenges for different aspects of 3D reconstruction and SLAM (such as depth estimation, alignment, or tracking stability) would ground the paper\u2019s contributions more effectively. A focused narrative in the introduction that explains why noise resilience is critical would better support the rationale for the proposed solution.\n\nLimited Analysis of Model Vulnerabilities: Although the paper introduces a robust benchmark for noisy conditions, it lacks a detailed analysis of specific vulnerabilities of existing models across different types of noise. This analysis could enrich the understanding of how and why noise affects certain models more than others and help position CorrGS as a targeted solution to these specific gaps. Adding such an analysis would make the benchmark more actionable and informative for future model improvement.\n\nIt can be understood the authors conducted extensive experiments and have a lot of content wish to express, yet the logic of proposing a novel method to fill a gap is overwhelmed by the extensive details. I think this work would be more fit for a journal instead of ICLR."

This might not fully capture the unpredictable nature of some real-world scenarios.\n\nThis paper provides a new benchmark for evaluating ego-motion and 3D reconstruction quality in noisy environments, but it does not introduce any new evaluation metrics, relying instead on existing ones like ATE, PSNR, and Depth L1 Loss. While this is not a significant weakness, it might even be considered somewhat nit-picky to note. However, introducing new metrics specifically tailored to the unique challenges posed by noisy environments could have further strengthened the paper\u2019s contributions.\n\nAlthough the internal clean model is progressively refined, the method starts with the baseline assumption of a rough model that is iteratively improved. In some extreme real-world scenarios, where no good initialization is available, the system might initially struggle, which could be a practical limitation. Again, I acknowledge this may be somewhat nit-picky as well."

                "value": "1. I had a hard time reading through the entire paper when I was trying to understand the technical details, and I think that the papers need some refactors. There is extensive cross-referencing to the appendix in the middle of the main text, making the flow of understanding constantly interrupted by having to refer to the details later. While the benchmark, the analysis, and the new CorrGS method are all valid contributions, it would be nice to re-prioritize their importance and put more texts and the details of the most important part in the main text, while putting other parts in the appendix. For example, the entire section 3 could be largely shortened or even removed since the mathematical formulations are rather simple and do not help convey the simple idea behind the scenes.\n\n2. The noise added to the synthetic Replica dataset (e.g. perturbation on depth sensor imaging) does not authentically simulate the real-world depth images. Real-world ToF cameras usually expose systematic noise with planes being pushed to curves, but the paper's enhancement method simply adds independent Gaussian noise to the depth images. This does not align with real-world observations.\n\n3. The introduced benchmark is heavily based on Replica that only contains a limited number of indoor scenes. To further improve the utility of the benchmark it is advisable that the authors investigates into more diverse capturing settings, such as outdoor scenes (where the depth camera still works) and highly-dynamic scenes. \n\n4. While the main goal of the paper is to provide a benchmark that helps these Neural-SLAM methods perform better on real-world settings (by synthesizing real-world noises), it does not test its flagship method CorrGS on many real-world scenes. The only reconstruction results provided is Sec 6.3, where a relatively small chunk of real-world videos are reconstructed. It would be intriguing to see CorrGS being applied to more real-world datasets such as ScanNet++."
