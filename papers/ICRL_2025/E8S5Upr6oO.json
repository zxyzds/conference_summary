    "title": "MGMapNet: Multi-Granularity Representation Learning for End-to-End Vectorized HD Map Construction",
    "abstract": "The construction of Vectorized High-Definition (HD) map typically requires capturing both category and geometry information of map elements. Current state-of-the-art methods often adopt solely either point-level or instance-level representation, overlooking the strong intrinsic relationships between points and instances. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient framework named MGMapNet (Multi-Granularity Map Network) to model map element with a multi-granularity representation, integrating both coarse-grained instance-level and fine-grained point-level queries. Specifically, these two granularities of queries are generated from the multi-scale bird's eye view (BEV) features using a proposed Multi-Granularity Aggregator. In this module, instance-level query aggregates features over the entire scope covered by an instance, and the point-level query aggregates features locally. Furthermore, a Point Instance Interaction module is designed to encourage information exchange between instance-level and point-level queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MGMapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing MapTRv2 by 5.3 mAP on nuScenes and 4.4 mAP on Argoverse2 respectively.",

From Figure 1 and 3. we can see the advantages of MGMapNet over other models. However, I can still see that the extracted lanes by MGMapNet are sometimes zigzagged while the ground truth lines are straight lines. I wonder whether you can add some regularity or loss terms to avoid this. Maybe for those straight lines, resample their vertices along the straight lines every times during model training so that the model learns the linear feature instead of individual point locations?\n\n3. Can you describe each loss term in detail? Do you use the distance from each point to the ground truth points as the loss for L_{pts}?"
