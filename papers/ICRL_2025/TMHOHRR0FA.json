    "title": "Rethinking the \"Heatmap + Monte Carlo Tree Search'' Paradigm for Solving Large Scale TSP",
    "abstract": "The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) remains a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, inspiring diverse algorithmic strategies. This paper revisits the ``heatmap + Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\" paradigm that has recently gained traction for learning-based TSP solutions. Within this framework, heatmaps encode the likelihood of edges forming part of the optimal tour, and MCTS refines this probabilistic guidance to discover optimal solutions. Contemporary approaches have predominantly emphasized the refinement of heatmap generation through sophisticated learning models, inadvertently sidelining the critical role of MCTS. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals two pivotal insights: \\textbf{1}) The configuration of MCTS strategies profoundly influences the solution quality, demanding meticulous tuning to leverage their full potential; \\textbf{2}) Our findings demonstrate that a rudimentary and parameter-free heatmap, derived from the intrinsic $k$-nearest nature of TSP, can rival or even surpass the performance of complicated heatmaps, with strong generalizability across various scales. Empirical evaluations across various TSP scales underscore the efficacy of our approach, achieving competitive results. These observations challenge the prevailing focus on heatmap sophistication, advocating a reevaluation of the paradigm to harness both components synergistically.",

                "value": "We sincerely thank all SACs, PCs, ACs, and reviewers for their time and effort on our manuscript. While we appreciate the constructive comments, we believe there are some misunderstandings about our work's core contributions and significance. In this response, we will first highlight our key contributions to learning-based TSP solving, followed by addressing the common concerns raised by reviewers.\n\n## Motivation of the \"heatmap + MCTS\" paradigm\nThe \"heatmap + MCTS\" paradigm first introduced by [1] and subsequently adopted by several state-of-the-art methods  [2,3,4], has emerged as one of the most successful approaches for solving large-scale TSP  instances with up to 10,000 nodes, significantly outperforming previous neural approaches. One should note, the main motivation of this series of works is:\n\n**Main motivation**: To better solve large-scale TSPs \n\nThis motivation inspires an abundance of following works to develop more sophisticated heatmap generation methods seeking to push the boundary of solution quality. Here, please remember the **main motivation of all this line of work**.\n\n## Our Motivation\nWe want to emphasize that our motivation aligns with the **Main motivation** stated above in the first place. Designing fancy heatmap generation methods, in our opinion, serves as a path to the **Main motivation**. Despite its remarkable success of \"heatmap+MCTS\", there has been a notable gap in systematically analyzing which component plays the pivotal role in this framework. Previous works have implicitly assumed the dominance of the heatmap component, directing most research efforts towards developing sophisticated learning-based heatmap construction methods. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal a surprising and novel finding: even with a simple zero-initialized heatmap devoid of any prior information, properly tuned MCTS parameters can achieve remarkably competitive results. This finding fundamentally challenges the prevailing assumption about the heatmap's primacy in the framework, and can be a big step towards the **Main motivation**.\n\n## Our Contribution\nOur work makes two significant contributions to address this research gap. \n1. First, through systematic parameter tuning - the most straightforward approach - we demonstrate the crucial importance of MCTS  in the framework, which has been previously underestimated. \n2. Second, we propose a parameter-free heatmap based on optimal solution priors, which exhibits strong generalization capabilities and achieves comparable  performance to many existing learning-based heatmaps. \n\nWhile we acknowledge the impressive performance of previously proposed heatmaps, our findings raise important questions for the research community:  \n\n> **Should we continue investing substantial computational resources and research efforts in designing increasingly complex heatmaps for TSP?  Have we perhaps strayed from our primary goal of solving the TSP efficiently?** \n\nWe believe these questions merit serious consideration as we move forward in this field. And we believe these helpful findings represent substantial contributions, and stick to the **Main motivation** to better solve large-scale TSP, rather than proposing complicated methodical designs.\n\n## Response to Common Concerns\n### 1. Regarding Novelty and Research Values\nWe appreciate the reviewers' concerns about novelty, but we believe there might be a misunderstanding about the fundamental value and contribution of our work. We would like to emphasize that true scientific advancement doesn't always necessitate complex, novel methodologies; sometimes, **it requires challenging established assumptions and redirecting research focus through straightforward yet insightful analysis**. \nOur work's novelty lies in its critical examination of a widely accepted paradigm rather than proposing another sophisticated solution. We deliberately chose simple, interpretable approaches to demonstrate our findings because they most clearly illuminate the overlooked aspects of the \"heatmap + MCTS\" framework. \nWe respectfully ask reviewers to reconsider our work's value through this lens as a contribution that **promotes critical thinking** and **potentially redirects research efforts** toward more efficient problem-solving approaches.\n### 2. Generalization to Other CO Tasks\nAs proposed in the title of our manuscript, we specifically focused on TSP as the \"Heatmap + MCTS\" paradigm is uniquely successful in this domain, with state-of-the-art results from multiple recent works [1,2,3]. Notably, this paradigm has not yet been successfully adapted to other CO problems - current leading approaches for CVRP and other tasks use different methodologies entirely.\n\nWe will address the specific concerns raised by each reviewer in the following individual responses. We sincerely appreciate your time and  attention in reading through this global response.\n\nThe Authors"

                "value": "This paper suggests a novel approach to solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) by leveraging neural combinatorial optimization techniques, focusing on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) that utilizes a probability distribution in the form of a heatmap for city-to-city edges. Although existing studies have also explored methods combining heatmaps and MCTS, this paper highlights that optimizing MCTS parameters within the conventional 'heatmap + MCTS' framework can enhance performance. Building on this insight, the authors propose a new, parameter-free algorithm for heatmap generation called GT-Prior. Experimental results from TSP-500, TSP-1000, and TSP-10000 demonstrate that performance improvements can be achieved through MCTS parameter optimization in current heatmap-based methods. Furthermore, the GT-Prior algorithm, when integrated with MCTS, achieves performance that is comparable to or slightly better than traditional approaches."

Considering this, the paper\u2019s finding that \u2018MCTS has a large impact and careful tuning improves performance\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel particularly novel. It would be helpful to include a discussion on the advantages of MCTS over other local search algorithms (e.g., 2-opt) to clarify why MCTS is chosen. Additionally, an analysis of the synergy between MCTS and the heatmap approach would add value, especially considering that, as seen in Table 2, algorithms like Dimes and UTSP perform worse than Zero when MCTS is used.\n\n3, MCTS involves numerous hyperparameters and appears highly sensitive to these settings, which could make practical implementation challenging and less accessible."

Do you anticipate that similar results would be achieved if this approach were applied to other CO tasks, such as CVRP? Or are these findings specific to TSP? I\u2019m curious to know if the method generalizes well to tasks beyond TSP.\n\n2, The experimental setup in Section 5.3 (\u201cGENERALIZATION ABILITY\u201d) could be clarified. \bFor example, for DIMES on TSP-1000, it is unclear whether the original (ORI.) setup uses a model and MCTS tuned for TSP-500 or TSP-1000. Similarly, does the generalization (GEN.) setting use MCTS tuned specifically for TSP-1000, or is it using MCTS tuned for TSP-500? Adding a table or flowchart to illustrate the training and testing configurations, specifying the problem sizes for model training, MCTS tuning, and evaluation, would greatly enhance clarity."

In this paper, the authors simply tuned the existing hyperparameters of MCTS without introducing new hyperparameters or proposing a new tuning method, and in doing so, confirmed that it is possible to improve the accuracy of solving TSP. The authors claim that previous studies have not paid attention to the values of MCTS hyperparameters and emphasize the need for careful tuning of MCTS hyperparameters. In previous studies proposing new heatmap generation methods, it seems that MCTS hyperparameters were intentionally left untuned to allow for a fair comparison of the heatmap's performance. While this paper\u2019s confirmation that tuning MCTS hyperparameters can improve TSP solution accuracy has some value, it is not novel that tuning hyperparameters can enhance solver performance. Therefore, simply finding better values for existing hyperparameters through traditional tuning methods is considered to lack novelty.\n\n\n- The newly proposed GT-Prior heatmap generation method in this paper suggests a way to create a heatmap with minimal computation. Although this method showed the best performance in TSP-10000, it yielded worse results than existing methods (DIFUSCO, SOFTDIST) in TSP-500 and TSP-1000. Additionally, since the GT-Prior method statistically calculates the likelihood of inclusion in the optimal solution based on a ranking of **distances between nodes**, it is likely difficult to apply this method to problems other than TSP, especially those with complex constraints."

Given that TSP-10000 is larger in scale, I would expect more instances to be used than for the smaller TSP problems, yet only 128 were used. What is the reason for this? Similarly, I would like to know the authors' opinion on whether it is appropriate to calculate $\\hat{P}_N()$ based on statistics from only 128 instances for TSP-10000. \n- Additionally, please confirm whether the $\\hat{P}_N()$ used in the experiments in Table 2 and Table 3 was generated using the same number of instances."
