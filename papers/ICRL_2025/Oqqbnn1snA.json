    "title": "FedGraph: A New Paradigm for Federated Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed approach to training a global model over multiple clients without sharing their local data. In graph data, the data heterogeneity can correspond to subgraph structures and node features varying extremely different, and the task-specific knowledge isolation corresponds to exclusive schema on handing data for specific task in clients, e.g., anomaly user setting in Twitter is rather different from LinkedIn. Although most feder- ated graph learning approaches are employed to address the data heterogeneity challenge, we find that the task-specific knowledge isolation challenge has been overlooked. This task-specific knowl- edge isolation will prevent existing models into the federated graph learning framework. In this paper, we propose FedGraph: a new paradigm for federated graph learning. The key idea is to utilize the graph structure without private node features as structure knowl- edge bridging all task specific knowledge in clients. Our extensive experiments show that FedGraph significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on anomaly de- tection tasks. Two deep learning models and one existing anomaly subgraph detection model are transferred to FedGraph framework.",

                "value": "This paper introduces FedGraph, a novel paradigm for federated graph learning that aims to address both data heterogeneity and model isolation challenges in federated graph learning. Specifically, the authors propose to use graph structures as a bridge to connect private features and algorithms across different clients, transforming private knowledge into public structural knowledge for sharing, and design mechanisms for local structure knowledge updates and adaptive sampling.\n\nThe main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The paper is the first to propose a federated graph learning paradigm that does not require parameter aggregation.\n2. It supports the migration of various existing graph learning models to the FedGraph framework.\n3. The experimental results on five datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to previous methods."

The problem formalization section lacks a clear description of the specific task types addressed on graph data, and instead focuses primarily on formalizing the challenges faced. The purpose of this section is unclear as it fails to convey the author's task objectives, making it inconsistent with the section's intended purpose.\n\n2. The main illustrative figures only show formal definitions of federated graph learning problems without demonstrating the actual algorithmic process or providing visual representations. The figure descriptions lack any concrete introduction to the algorithm content. No effective information about the proposed FedGraph algorithm can be obtained from these figures.\n\n3. The description of the main algorithmic components is unclear and lacks coherence. Each sub-module describes its own functionality without explaining the connections between modules. The paper also lacks a complete and detailed description of the federated learning process, particularly regarding the interactions between clients and server and their respective behaviors in each round.\n\n4. The methodology section appears to implement each module using existing algorithms from previous work. The paper lacks a clear description of its own integrative contributions and innovations.\n\n5. The experimental evaluation is limited to small-scale datasets, lacking validation on larger-scale datasets and more clients setting. Furthermore, the experimental objectives remain inadequately described, making it difficult to fully assess the method's effectiveness and generalizability.  it was not until the appendix that we learned that the experimental part of the article is an anomaly detection task."

In this setting, local graph structures are heterogeneous, and local algorithms (models) may vary. The authors propose a method that leverages structural knowledge to bridge task-specific knowledge. This is achieved by learning relevant public structures through the aggregation of local structures via network alignment, which is then shared back with the clients."

Additionally, it is hard to tell what the key challenges are from the introduction.\n2. The overall presentation needs improvement, as many sections require effort to understand. For example, the key points of each paragraph in the introduction are unclear, and the transitions lack logic and smoothness.\n3. While the authors introduce the new concept of \u201cmodel isolation to federated graph tasks,\u201d it\u2019s unclear how this differs from data/model heterogeneity in FL. Moreover, it\u2019s essential to clarify how model isolation relates to structural knowledge.\n4. Although this work is presented as a generic federated graph framework, it focuses on a single downstream task (anomaly detection) and experiments on limited datasets and methods. Narrowing the scope or making the key contributions clearer is necessary.\n5. There exist privacy concerns regarding alignment, i.e., node identities stored on the server. Are these nodes anonymous? If so, how are they aligned with local node features? Additionally, privacy concerns exist for identities transmitted between the server and clients.\n6. In different graph structure settings, the proposed FL paradigm is unrelated to local features and model training. Thus, claiming it addresses the challenges (characteristics) is not convincing, as it bypasses them. Also, there are no experiments involving different local algorithms.\n7. There is no hyperparameter study regarding the important predefined alignment threshold, $\\sigma$.\n8. The paper lacks discussion on efficiency and privacy aspects.\n9.

How does coalition partition relate to the set of public knowledge {U}? It\u2019s unclear how coalition partition is derived from the {U}. From the authors' sentence \u201ccomputing graph connected components in the global graph G0\u201d, the partition of $\\Pi$ can differ from the partition of {U}, then how can the contribution be calculated?\nQ5. Why is federated learning needed in a scenario where graph structures, local algorithms, and tasks differ significantly?\nQ6. How is the received relevant public knowledge used locally while the local clients still train models using the original local features and structures?\nQ7. If the focus is on graph anomaly detection, using the same algorithms seems feasible. What is the motivation behind not sharing models in FL and using structures to bridge the \u201cmodel gap\u201d?\nQ8. Why not use common anomaly detection benchmark datasets?\nQ9. In Table 1, why does accuracy for the same setting vary so widely across methods (e.g., from 9.82 to 90.48)?"
