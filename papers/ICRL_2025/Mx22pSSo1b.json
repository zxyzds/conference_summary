    "title": "Learning Rotation-Invariant Representation using Rotation-Equivariant CNNs",
    "abstract": "Conventional self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as SimCLR and SimSiam, have demonstrated significant effectiveness. However, their feature representation is not robust to image rotations, as rotational augmentation may negatively impact the framework. In this paper, we address this limitation by applying SSL to group-equivariant CNNs, specifically rotation-equivariant CNNs, to develop robust features. To learn expressive, rotation-invariant features, we introduce our training method, Guiding Invariance with Equivariance (GIE), which simultaneously trains both invariant features and the equivariance score for images. The equivariance score guides the rotation-equivariant features through an attention-weighted sum mechanism, enabling the development of rotation-invariant features. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our GIE method not only extracts high-performing features under four discrete rotations but also achieves robustness to random-degree rotations through rotation augmentation training. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving robust rotation-invariance.",

                "value": "The main weakness of this work is that, after reading the paper multiple times, it is still unclear to me what the contribution of the paper is over existing work. I will outline this in detail as follows:\n\n- **positioning relative to existing work.** As mentioned in the related work section, there already exists multiple works that learn robust equivariant and invariant representations in an unsupervised manner. However, the authors do not outline what the differences are between this work and existing works. The objective of the related work section should be to position your work relative to others. Not to list what exists.\n\n  To complement my previous statement, papers such as [1], which propose a very similar method to learn invariant and equivariant representations, are not cited, let alone discussed. In fact, the formulation of [1] is more general, and considered wider, more complex groups than this paper. The contribution of the paper over existing work remains uncertain.\n\n\n-  **Components and analyses already done in previous work.** One of the core components of the method is the *group attentioning* operation the authors introduce. However, this has been proposed previously over 4 years ago in [2, 3]. See, for example, how Fig. 3 in [2] summarizes Eqs. (1-8).\n\n   Note in addition that [3] explicitly mentions the problem with squared images (Appx. C). \n\n- **repeated analyses and conclusions.** I consider many of the statements included / derived in this paper to be well-known from literature. For example:\nLine 316 - \u2026 we evaluate the linear class. acc. on both the NR and R datasets, which included images rotated in four directions. As shown GIE achieves highest accuracy on the R dataset. (Similar in lines 360 and 367). Results in Figure 4. \n-> Please note that this is a direct effect of using G-CNNs. This has been known and proved for many years. For example, note how Fig 4 clearly resembles analyses done over 5 years ago by [4] (see Fig 4 in [4] ). It is unclear what the new insights are.\nAnalyses similar to those in Fig 5 were done in [1] as well. In fact, similar analyses have been done previously based on class-dependent statistics (not only dataset level statistics) in [5].\n\nAn additional concern relates to how the method is not comparing its results with previous related works, e.g., [1]."

                "value": "### Questions and additional comments\n\n- At the end of Sec 4.4, the authors have a paragraph depicting an extension to p8. But this paragraph does not summarize the findings of the result. It only states that it has been done. \n\n- Why did the authors only restrained themselves to networks equivariant to discrete groups instead of continuous? Note that, it is even possible to define continuous equivariant networks that work with regular representations, e.g., [6]. \n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDue to the points outlined before, it is very difficult to gauge what the contribution and significance of this work is. I encourage the authors to spend time doing a thorough literature review, and outlining the differences of their method with existing approaches. Also, comparisons to more relevant methods should be considered in the experimental section. \n\nBased on the previous analysis, I am unable to recommend acceptance at this point.\n\n### References \n\n[1] Winter, R., Bertolini, M., Le, T., No\u00e9, F. and Clevert, D.A., 2022.

It would be better validate the method on the applications with rotation variance issues, such as object detection and key point matching. \n- Following the last point, the image level global rotation is not very common in real-world scenarios.

This approach raises an intriguing question: is the proposed GIE method superior to simply combining rotation-equivariant CNNs with rotation-based data augmentation? Given the discrete nature of digital images, achieving exact rotation equivariance is challenging. Previous work on rotation-equivariant networks has shown that adding rotation augmentation can still improve accuracy, despite the inherent rotation equivariance of these networks. Interestingly, this paper demonstrates that E2CNN with GIE outperforms E2CNN with rotation augmentation in rotation-invariant classification tasks, suggesting that SSL+GIE achieves a level of robustness that data augmentation alone cannot. Depending on further evidence, this could be viewed as either a strength or a potential weakness."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Effectiveness of SSL and GIE with E2CNN: A primary concern is that an E2CNN can potentially be trained without SSL or GIE and still achieve robust rotation invariance. If this is the case, the need for incorporating SSL and GIE to improve E2CNN becomes unclear. While Tables 1 and 2 show that SSL+GIE+E2CNN outperforms SSL+E2CNN, it\u2019s worth noting that E2CNN is inherently equivariant to the p4-group, which may indicate a limitation in the number of orientation samples. The experiment in the appendix, comparing the p4-group and p8-group, raises questions, as the authors have matched GPU memory usage instead of parameter count\u2014an approach that deviates from common practice in equivariant network studies, which typically prioritize matching parameter counts. Since matched parameter counts are more relevant for fair comparisons, this paper should provide evidence that SSL+GIE+E2CNN is superior to SSL+E2CNN, and to E2CNN alone, with matched parameter counts for p16- and even p32-groups. I think that matched parameter count is more important than matched GPU memory consumption in the long run as GPU hardware is evolving fast.\n\nI tend to change score based on the answer to this question.\n\n\n2. Motivation and Benchmark Choices: Some motivations in Figure 1 are debatable. While humans may struggle with reading rotated text, recognizing rotated objects generally relies more on shape than orientation, so rotation is less problematic for object recognition without canonicalization. Furthermore, E2CNN has achieved over 99% accuracy on rotated handwritten digits in MNIST, effectively distinguishing between rotated 6 and 9, likely due to shape differences inherent in handwriting styles. Despite the relevance of rotated MNIST as a benchmark in rotation-equivariant literature, this dataset is absent from the paper\u2019s evaluations. MNIST offers a zero-background advantage, which is ideal for testing rotation without cropping, so including it could strengthen the results and make us easy to compare the results in equivariant literature.\n\n\n3. Parameter Comparison in Results: The SSL+GIE+E2CNN models consistently have more parameters than SSL+E2CNN due to the additional equivariance predictor, which makes the results less convincing. For instance, in Table 1, SimSiam+GIE+E2CNN+EqvPred (76.54%) uses 12.83M parameters, while SimSiam+GIE+E2CNN+group pooling (73.26%) has 11.14M parameters. This additional 15% in parameters only yields a 4% accuracy increase, which is not particularly impressive. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could demonstrate that SSL+GIE+E2CNN performs better than SSL+E2CNN with fewer or equal parameters."

However, lines 315-316 state, \u201cAfter pretraining, we froze the pretrained backbone and attached a linear classifier to measure linear classification accuracy.\u201d Since E2CNN can serve as the backbone, does this mean that it is followed by linear layers without GIE during testing? This is somewhat unclear; could you please clarify?\n2. In Figure 4, the E2CNN-Gpool curves (brown) appear flatter than the GIE curves (pink), although they are lower overall. How is robustness quantified here? Can it be inferred that curves with lower variance are more robust than those with higher variance?"
