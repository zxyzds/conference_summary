    "title": "Dynamic Interference Modeling For Estimating Treatment Effects From Dynamic Graphs",
    "abstract": "Estimating treatment effects can assist decision-making in various areas, such as commerce and medicine. One application of the treatment effect estimation is to predict the effect of an advertisement on the purchase result of a customer, known as individual treatment effect (ITE).  In online websites, the outcome of an individual can be affected by treatments of other individuals, as people often propagate information with their friends,  a phenomenon referred to as interference. Prior studies have attempted to model interference for accurate ITE estimation under a static network among individuals. However, the network usually changes over time in real-world applications due to complex social activities among individuals. For instance,  an individual can follow another individual on one day and unfollow this individual afterward on an online social website. In this case, the outcomes of individuals can be interfered with not only by treatments for current neighbors but also by past information and treatments for past neighbors, which we refer to as \\emph{dynamic interference}. In this work, we model dynamic interference for the first time by developing an architecture to aggregate both the past information of individuals and their neighbors. Specifically, our proposed method contains a mechanism that summarizes historical information of individuals from previous time stamps,  graph neural networks that propagate information about individuals within every time stamp, and a weighting mechanism that estimates the importance of different time stamps. Moreover, the model parameters should gradually change rather than drastically because information of every individual gradually changes over time. To take it into account, we also propose a variant of our method to evolve the model parameters over time with long short-term memory. In our experiments on multiple datasets with dynamic interference, our methods outperform existing methods for ITE estimation because they are unable to capture dynamic interference. This result corroborates the importance of dynamic interference modeling.",

                "value": "This work is designed to learn a dynamic interference modeling for estimating treatment effects. Genearlly speaking, the proposed problem is interesting. Prior research has focused on static interference in fixed networks, but real-world networks often change over time, leading to dynamic interference. To tackle the issues in this field, this study introduces a model for dynamic interference, aggregating both past and current information of individuals. Specifically, the proposed model uses a mechanism for summarizing historical data, graph neural networks for time-stamped interactions, and an attention-based weighting system to learn the contribution of each timestamp. Additionally, it adjusts parameters gradually to reflect evolving information dynamics, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) to update them. Experiments show that this approach outperforms existing models, highlighting the significance of accounting for dynamic interference in ITE estimation."

The model design seems combine many existing approaches. Stacking dnn layer to capture dynamic information and using attention mechanism to automatically learn the contribution of each timestamp are quite general methods.\n2. More advanced gnn-based models should be considered such as lightgcn, gat. \n3. Some important references are missing such as Treatment Effect Estimation Amidst Dynamic Network Interference in Online Gaming Experiments.\n4. In a closer look at dynamic interference part, a larger t_max should be considered. It can be better to describe the effect of the historical information. More historical information, better performance. Also, showing the trade-off between the running time and the value of t_max may make the results more convincing."

While the mechanism diagrams for DITE and DIM are present, a comprehensive experimental framework diagram is missing. This oversight makes it difficult to quickly grasp the main contributions and optimization mechanisms of the article. I suggest including a clearer framework diagram to facilitate understanding for readers.\n3. In the results section, the main experimental results include only two comparison metrics. I recommend adding more widely used metrics to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the experimental results. Additionally, conducting further experiments to validate the model's performance\u2014beyond simple comparisons of standard deviation and mean\u2014would be beneficial. Presenting these comparisons in more intuitive charts would also help to better showcase the experimental outcomes."

The model, even with help of DITEev, introduces a large number of trainbale parameters. The authors should clarify the size of the training dataset used and provide experimental results on how model accuracy depends on the amount of training data.\n3. While the proposed algorithm is well-suited for the problem, its real-world applicability is limited. Accessing complete network dynamics and covariates for all individuals is often infeasible, and the algorithm\u2019s runtime on large networks may also pose practical challenges.\n4. The experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets, where the ITE aligns with the model assumptions. To validate the model's utility, evaluation on real-world data would be beneficial.\n5.

The HA mechanism utilizes a temporal attention mechanism (T-Attention) to estimate the importance of different timestamps and aggregates historical information with weighted importance. The WA mechanism aggregates information within each timestamp using a single-layer GNN. By stacking DIM layers, the model can capture multi-hop dynamic interference among neighbors.\n\nSpecifically, to address confounding factors, the approach reduces confounding bias by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the covariate representation distributions of the control and treatment groups.\n\nAdditionally, the authors design an outcome prediction module based on interference representation, covariate representation, and a treatment training predictor, optimized with a specific loss function.

Investigating how to use historical data and the current model state to predict future timestamp covariates, treatments, and graph structure could support future timestamp ITE estimation.
