    "title": "From Abstract Noise to Architectural Form: Designing Diffusion Models for Efficient Floor Plan Generation",
    "abstract": "In contemporary architectural design, the generation of innovative and efficient floor plans remains a critical challenge. This research introduces a novel application of diffusion models, specifically adapted for the generation of architectural floor plans. Unlike traditional generative models that broadly target image generation, our approach harnesses the state-of-the-art in diffusion technology to produce detailed, functional, and visually appealing architectural designs. We demonstrate that diffusion models, when finely tuned and conditioned, not only embrace 'implicit, human-learned' architectural semantics but also enhance design efficiency and creativity. The paper details our methodology from adapting the U-Net architecture within diffusion frameworks to incorporating advanced upscaling techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high-resolution outputs. Our results show a promising direction for integrating AI in architectural design, opening new avenues for automated, creative design processes that could revolutionize the industry.",

Moreover, there is no comparison to prior work that performs architectural floor plan generation [1]. \n\n- **Lack of objective, expert evaluation for qualitative analysis**: Even with the evaluation criteria listed by the author(s) in Section 8.1, some of these evaluations would be significantly strengthened if conducted by real architects, or practitioner(s) with significant architectural experience. It is unclear if the research team has such expertise.\n\n- **Limited Novelty of Application or use of Diffusion Models**: There are ample prior work for using Diffusion Models for Architectural Floor plan generation [1] or other kinds of layout generation [2], which reduces the novelty of this work. The author(s) also did not cite these other related work and/or discuss the relationship/difference between the presented work and prior work.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model With Discrete and Continuous Denoising.

The current dataset is still quite limited (Residential floor plan only ).\n\n**Insufficient evaluation:** The paper lacks quantitative metrics and comparisons of related methods, including how to assess the rationality of generated floor plans. For design tasks, more professional architectural designers' user evaluations may be needed.\n\nI consider this to be an inspiring report on the interdisciplinary area. I encourage the authors to conduct more detailed technical innovation and experimental evaluation. For ICLR, this paper clearly lacks innovation and systematic methodology. Therefore, I believe this paper would be more suitable for submission to architectural design-related conferences, as it does not quite meet the threshold for current AI conferences."
