    "abstract": "The interaction of a protein with its environment can be understood and controlled via its 3D structure. Experimental methods for protein structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy, shed light on biological processes but introduce challenging inverse problems. Learning-based approaches have emerged as accurate and efficient methods to solve these inverse problems for 3D structure determination, but are specialized for a predefined type of measurement. Here, we introduce a versatile framework to turn raw biophysical measurements, such as cryo-EM density maps, into 3D atomic models. Our method combines a physics-based forward model of the measurement process with a pretrained generative model providing a task-agnostic, data-driven prior. Our method outperforms posterior sampling baselines on linear and non-linear inverse problems. In particular, it is the first diffusion-based method for refining atomic models from simulated cryo-EM maps.",

                "value": "The paper introduced a framework, ADP-3D, which uses a diffusion model as a prior to solve the inverse problem in structural biology. The authors leverage the pretrained diffusion models in the atomic model space like Chroma and RFDiffusion as their prior. The downstream tasks include structure completion (as a toy problem), atomic model refinement (model completion given a simulated density map, an incomplete atomic model, and the sequence), and solving structure from given pairwise distances."

Since the paper uses pretrained diffusion models from Chroma and RFDiffusion, and the measurement models for the tasks are apparent, from a methodological standpoint, my understanding is that the main contribution of this paper is the MAP estimation method given a diffusion prior. As ADP-3D seems like a generic algorithm that is not heavily tailored for structural biology, there are many similar methods in the field of diffusion posterior sampling for inverse problems, e.g. DPS, $\\Pi$GDM, as surveyed in [1] and also mentioned in the related work section by the authors. The authors should compare the similarities and differences between the propose ADP-3D method and other similar algorithms. The authors should also use at least one of these methods as the baseline and compare the results to show the advantage of the proposed ADP-3D method.\n\n2. I understand that real data is not considered in the scope of this paper, but this makes the downstream tasks a bit far from the real world implementation. For example, the model refinement task uses a small, simulated density as a given condition, while ModelAngelo itself was trained on real experimental density maps. In reality, it is possible that ModelAngelo does not even output a severely incomplete model, making the whole setting of this task futile.\n\n3. The model refinement task seems to only contain one example (7pzt).\n\n\n[1] Daras, Giannis, et al. \"A survey on diffusion models for inverse problems.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2410.00083 (2024)."

                "value": "The paper introduces ADP-3D (Atomic Denoising Prior for 3D reconstruction), an algorithm to combine a pretrained protein diffusion model with additional data. The method uses a plug-n-play approach that splits the log posterior into a prior and likelihood term, duplicates the variables and couples them via a quadratic term. This allows the authors to avoid incorporating the likelihood directly into the diffusion process. Instead only a simple quadratic term needs to be added to the likelihood, and a diffusion step is used to incorporate the prior. No retraining of the diffusion model is necessary. The authors focus on the Chroma model (Ingraham et al., 2023) for protein structures and combine the model with various likelihoods (structure completion from sub-sampled backbone positions, model refinement based on a density map, sequence information, incomplete distance matrix). Using specific examples, the authors find that the incorporation of the diffusion process improves the quality of the reconstructed structures."

ADP-3D is a straight forward application of the plug-n-play framework to protein diffusion models. The idea of using a variable splitting approach to combine diffusion models with additional data has already been proposed by Zhu et al. (2023) in the context of image restoration. So the major novelty is in the application of the method to protein structure modeling. However, the authors only use simulated data in their numerical experiments."

            "questions": {
                "value": "* The abstract states that this is \"the first diffusion-based method for refining atomic models from simulated cryo-EM maps.\" Why did you not apply the method to real cryo-EM maps? The paper would be much stronger, if you showed applications to real data. Likewise, you could use NMR distance bounds as experimental distance information rather than simulated distances. \n* How do you choose the parameter $\\rho$? Are the results sensitive to the choice of $\\rho$? \n* How do you define __completeness__? You state that completeness is the \"RMSD of the predicted structure for the X% most well-resolved alpha carbons (compared to the deposited structure).\" How do you assess if an alpha carbon is well-resolved? Please note that the resolution of your model (in my understanding something like its precision) and its accuracy are not the same thing. \n* Figures 3, 4, 5 report the resolution of the deposited structure. What is the purpose of showing this number? The resolution of the PDB structure does not tell us anything about the difficulty of the structure calculation task.\n* Figure 5, right panel: Why does the RMSD increase with increasing number of distances (#pd > 4k) when not using a diffusion model? It should go down and should also approach zero for as many distances as 8 k pairwise distances for a protein of length 127 residues.\n\n__Additional feedback__\n\n* The selection of distances is unrealistic in the sense that, for example, NMR experiments such as NOESY only probe short distances up to 6 \\AA. Since there are many more long-range distances, your way of selecting distances randomly will tend to pick distances that are not experimentally accessible, which makes the selection process unrealistic. \n* The abstract states that \"raw biophysical measurements such as cryo-EM density maps\" can be used by your method. To categorize cryo-EM maps as raw data is misleading. A density map is the result of a complex sequence of processing steps starting with motion correction, particle picking, etc. The raw measurements in cryo-EM are the micrographs. \n* Figure 1 does not add much information beyond what is already said in the text. You could remove the figure and use the space to show more details about your numerical experiments such as your tests with RFdiffusion (Watson et al., 2023). \n* Likewise, figure 2 is a specific result for the correlation matrix used by Chroma. It could be moved to the supplementary information. \n* On page 8 you state that you avoid testing on structures that were part of the Chroma training set by using only structures that were published after the release of Chroma. However, this does not guarantee that the Chroma training set and your test structure do not overlap. First, many examples of structures of one and the same protein (or a protein with a highly similar sequence) can be found in the PDB. Second, protein structures are much more persistent than sequences. So even proteins with a low sequence similarity can have similar structures. \n* In the captions of figure 3 and 5, you report the lowest RMSD obtained with 8 runs. Please also report the maximum RMSD (you could also report the mean and the standard deviation) to give an indication of how much your models vary. \n* There is a slight inconsistency in your whole approach: You claim to do MAP estimation, but then you use diffusion-based sampling."

Has it been used for the other two inverse problems? It would be great if the authors can be more precise here. (I assume that Cryo-EM is mentioned as it is potentially the most high-impact application, but it would be good to be clear about the other problems as well)\n\nAdditional feedback\n- p.1, l.28: I would not start this paragraph with this sentence. The second sentence starting with \u201cExperimental methods in structural biology\u2026\u201d would be a better choice to give the reader a better idea of what you are actually addressing in this paragraph. The first sentence can still be used later on in the paragraph to motivate the experiments.\n- p.1. l.37: I would be reluctant to use the sentence \u201cThese approaches can estimate the uncertainty of their answers and provide theoretical guarantees of correctness, \u2026\u201d as there is little underlying theory that even guarantees that the iterates converge (the loss might converge at best, for which there is some theory in the case of RELION)\n- In section 2, the authors mainly focus on ModelAngelo. I would recommend to discuss the broader problem so that the reader gets a better feeling for the broader picture\n- p.2 l.90: In the second bullet of the contributions the authors claim to compare to sampling methods. In the experiment only one method is discussed. Please change this to singular (method)\n- Section 4.3: It feels a bit odd that there is a whole section for the model building part from Cryo-EM maps, but that the other inverse problems are defined in the experiments. I would suggest to create a new section in between what is now section 4 and 5 and discuss all three inverse problems there. This will be useful and more straightforward for the reader who is interested in just one of the applications.\n- p.7 l.360: I understand that in equation 13 several terms that are being conditioned on can be removed (\\bar{x} in the last term), but for the reader this might be a big step. I would suggest to write out the steps explicitly to get from the left hand side to the right hand side\n- p.8 l.409. typo: evalute -> evaluate\n- p.9 l.458. What do you mean with the sentence \u201cNote that we do not chose a structure that was resolved with cryo-EM because most cryo-EM-resolved models are incomplete.\u201d\n    - Also typo: chose -> choose"
