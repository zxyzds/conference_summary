    "title": "Warm Diffusion: Recipe for Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.",

There are currently many papers in this area, and everyone is focused on slightly improving FID and IS, but the visual quality is still much worse than the current FLUX. This leaves me with no motivation to decide whether to accept any of these papers."

The exact necessity of introducing blurring into the diffusion model should be given, which is the most important motivation of this work. Figure 5 shows that a lower BNR brings better FID results, which somehow seems to say that \u201cblur\u201d does not help to improve the quality of the generated image.\n\n2. For the sampling process presented in algorithm 2, the sampling starts from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. How can this be revealed from Eq. 4 (at time T)?\n\n3. As shown in Table 5, there exist large deviations among the results produced by different parameterizations. More explanation need to be provided."

I can't clearly understand what exactly the \u201cstrong correlation\u201d between high-frequency and low-frequency structures is. In Figure 3, why \u201cshifting more responsibility to the deblurring task\u201d means \u201ceffectively utilizing the spectral dependency of images\u201d?\n\nQ2. In regard to blur-to-noise-ratio (BNR) defined by this work, it seems that the noise level and the blur level do not change for all time t. I want to further confirm that mentioning the effects of BNR, does the proposed diffusion model actually have a sequence of (a_1,\u2026,a_T) and (b_1,\u2026,b_T) or just one a and b for all timesteps?"

This two training target operation enforces the network to simultaneously modeling the distribution of the blur and the residual. Besides, the blur also has various levels. These may make the distribution modeling task harder than just predicting the noise/data, especially when the data scale is large.\n3. The experimental results on large-scale datasets are missing, eg ImageNet.  Since the recent sota diffusion models usually conduct experiments on ImageNet and even larger-scale datasets, the results absence on these datasets make the actual performance and the superiority of this method ambiguous."
