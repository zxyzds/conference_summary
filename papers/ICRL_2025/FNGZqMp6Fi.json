    "abstract": "Micro Crack detection using deep neural networks(DNNs) through an automated pipeline using wave fields interacting with the damaged areas is highly sought after. However, these high dimensional spatio-temporal crack data are limited and, moreover these dataset have large dimension in the temporal domain. The dataset presents a substantial class imbalance, with crack pixels constituting an average of only 5% of the total pixels per sample, this extreme class imbalance poses a challenge for deep learning models with the different micro scale cracks, as the network can be biased toward predicting the majority class, generally lead- ing to poor detection accuracy. This study builds upon the previous benchmark SpAsE-Net, an asymmetric encoder\u2013decoder network for micro-crack detection. The impact of various activation and loss functions were examined through feature space visualisation using manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) algorithm. The optimized architecture and training methodology achieved an accuracy of 86.85%.",

                "value": "The paper introduces MicroCrackAttentionNeXt, an advanced deep learning model designed to enhance microcrack detection in structural materials using wave field analysis. Traditional CNNs struggle with the complex spatio-temporal patterns and severe class imbalance (cracks constitute only 5% of data). The model uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms, inspired by existing structures such as SpASe-Net, but optimized for micro-scale feature detection. The authors also explore the impact of various activation functions and loss strategies through Manifold Discovery and Analysis (MDA), aiming to improve feature separability and reduce overfitting. The proposed model achieves a significant accuracy of 86.85%, outperforming benchmark models in microcrack segmentation."

Minor Issues\n\n1. **Insufficient Hyperparameter Justification:**\n   - The choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and pooling sizes, is not well-justified, which could impact reproducibility.\n2. **Limited Discussion on Training Dynamics:**\n   - The paper does not discuss the model's convergence behavior or challenges faced during training, such as instability or overfitting.\n3. **Visual Representation Limitations:**\n   - Figures and visualizations of the MDA analysis could be clearer, especially in distinguishing the representations of trained versus untrained models.\n\n---\n\n### C. Recommendations\n\n1. Improve the analysis by incorporating real-world datasets to validate the model's performance and robustness.\n2. Provide a more extensive ablation study to clarify the importance of each architectural component and hyperparameter setting.\n3. Clarify visual representations and ensure the figures clearly depict the model's feature separability improvements."

How can the authors justify the model\u2019s generalizability in detecting microcracks under different material compositions or wave propagation scenarios, especially given the narrow dataset? Could this limit the model's application in real-world, diverse settings?\n\n2. **Comparative Baselines**: Although the paper positions MicroCrackAttentionNeXt as an improvement over SpAsE-Net, it lacks direct quantitative comparison with a broader range of state-of-the-art models in microcrack detection. Without such comparisons, how can the authors substantiate claims of improved accuracy or efficiency?\n\n3.  **Low-Resolution Segmentation**: The paper concedes that the segmentation output\u2019s low resolution could lead to loss of detail in crack localization. Given this limitation, how does the model ensure precise identification of microcracks, particularly those close to the resolution limit? Could this restriction render the model ineffective for critical applications requiring high localization accuracy?\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper predominantly relies on the accuracy and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), but these may not fully capture the model\u2019s capability in highly imbalanced, nuanced detection tasks. Why were more detailed metrics, such as precision-recall curves or area under the ROC curve (AUC), not included to provide a more comprehensive evaluation? Furthermore, was any statistical validation (e.g., confidence intervals) performed to ensure the robustness of the reported performance metrics?"

The authors are encouraged to evaluate/consider recent segmentation techniques or, at the very least, explain why recent architectures, such as those based on transformers, are excluded from the comparison. Recent segmentation techniques may have a much greater performance impact compared to the improvements derived from investigating different activation/loss functions.\nFor example, will an adaptation of SAM2 (or any other recent alternative) for your kind of data, might work?\n\n1.5) It is stated in the related work that this study extends 1D-DenseNet and is heavily influenced by it, but it is unclear what the specific similarities are and what the extensions consist of.

The work employs well-known components, such as convolutional layers and self-attention layers, in an architecture that is largely based on a previous work. It suggests using established loss functions and activation functions.\n\n3) The use of MDA is not well explained. I don\u2019t understand what contribution the MDA visualizations make.

Additionally, MDA evaluates the model based on another \"black-box\" DNN algorithm. Instead, a more concise approach would be to base the explanation on well-established metrics (such as DSC or accuracy) or straightforward visualizations from the model, such as attention maps, to demonstrate semantic understanding. From my perspective, simply demonstrating improved DSC or accuracy is more convincing for evaluating a segmentation model.
