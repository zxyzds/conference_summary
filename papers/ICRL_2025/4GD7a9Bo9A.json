    "title": "Bias Learning: Quantifying and Mitigating Position Sensitivity in Text Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Embedding models are crucial for tasks in Information Retrieval (IR) and semantic similarity measurement, yet their handling of longer texts and associated positional biases remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, particularly APE- and RoPE-based models, disproportionately prioritize the initial portion of the input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3\\% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity. We hypothesize that this effect arises from pre-processing strategies and chosen positional encoding techniques.  To address this, we introduce a novel data augmentation scheme called Position-Aware Data Sampling (PADS), which mitigates positional bias and improves embedding robustness across varying input lengths. These findings quantify the sensitivity of retrieval systems and suggest a new lens towards long-context embedding models.",

                "value": "This paper studies the phenomenon of positional bias in text embeddings. It observed that perturbations at the beginning of the texts affect the embeddings more than the changes at other parts of the texts. To reduce the positional discrepancy, a position-aware data sampling technique is proposed, where parts of the training data are sampled from later parts of the texts. Experiments show that after post-training with the technique, the resulted embeddings show reduced sensitivity to positions."

Many easy-to-run pipelines exist to evaluate on benchmarks such as MTEB, and there is no excuse to leave it to future work. It is important to evaluate on real retrieval task because it is unproven whether positional bias is harmful or not since such bias might naturally exists in real data. \n2. For section 4.3, the writing bias exists in the training data. To argue that the cause of the position bias is not human writing, it is better to shuffle the training data, train another embedding model and to see if the resulted embeddings still exists in the newly trained model."

Questions\n\n- I am confused by this claim \u201cEmbedding models, in contrast, are theoretically position-invariant, due to their lack of the causal attention mask\u201d. To the best of my knowledge, there are some LLM-based text embeddings like [1] with causal attention mask, although the causal attention mask may limit the performance of the embedding on STS tasks [2]. \n- I wonder if inserting irrelevant text or removing text will affect the coherence or change the semantics of the original text.\n- Long-context embeddings tend to capture topic-level semantics. it is more coarse-grained than short-context. Perturbation may not show significant changes in the results. Since two of the Alibi models are longer-context (>512 tokens), that might be the reason why it is more robust than RoPE. Could you separate the reported performance between long-context and short-context models for Table 2?\n- The selected embedding models are BERT-based and contain the special token CLS at the initial. Is it a possible reason why it prioritizes at the beginning? I guess the priority depends on the selected backbone. It would be appreciated if you could experiment with autoregressive LLM-based embeddings to see whether they will be prioritized in the last part of the text. This will make this work more comprehensive.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Lee, J., Dai, Z., Ren, X., Chen, B., Cer, D., Cole, J. R., ... & Naim, I. (2024).
