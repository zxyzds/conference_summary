    "abstract": "This paper investigates test-time adaptation (TTA) for regression, where a regression model pre-trained in a source domain is adapted to an unknown target distribution with unlabeled target data.\nAlthough regression is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning, most of the existing TTA methods have classification-specific designs, which assume that models output class-categorical predictions, whereas regression models typically output only single scalar values.\nTo enable TTA for regression, we adopt a feature alignment approach, which aligns the feature distributions between the source and target domains to mitigate the domain gap.\nHowever, we found that naive feature alignment employed in existing TTA methods for classification is ineffective or even worse for regression because the features are distributed in a small subspace and many of the raw feature dimensions have little significance to the output.\nFor an effective feature alignment in TTA for regression, we propose Significant-subspace Alignment (SSA).\nSSA consists of two components: subspace detection and dimension weighting.\nSubspace detection finds the feature subspace that is representative and significant to the output.\nThen, the feature alignment is performed in the subspace during TTA.\nMeanwhile, dimension weighting raises the importance of the dimensions of the feature subspace that have greater significance to the output.\nWe experimentally show that SSA outperforms various baselines on real-world datasets.",

In Section 3.1 of the article, the use of \"two diagonal Gaussian distributions\" is not adequately justified, and the advantages and limitations of employing such distributions are not discussed.\n2. The proposed method in this paper exhibits limited originality, as its various components are commonly found in existing models.\n3. The dataset utilized in this study has a relatively small sample size, which weakens the persuasiveness of the findings. Additionally, there is a lack of comparative algorithms from the past three years, resulting in insufficient theoretical validation. Furthermore, the measurement standard is solely based on R\u00b2; incorporating additional metrics such as RMSE and RMAE would enhance the evaluation."
