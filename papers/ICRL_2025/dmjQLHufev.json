    "title": "Learning Structured Universe Graph with Outlier OOD Detection for Partial Matching",
    "abstract": "Partial matching is a kind of graph matching where only part of two graphs can be aligned. This problem is particularly important in computer vision applications, where challenges like point occlusion or annotation errors often occur when labeling key points.  Previous work has often conflated point occlusion and annotation errors, despite their distinct underlying causes. We propose two components to address these challenges: (1) a structured universe graph is learned to connect two input graphs $X_{ij} = X_{iu} X_{ju}^\\top$, effectively resolving the issue of point occlusion; (2) an energy-based out-of-distribution detection is designed to remove annotation errors from the input graphs before matching. We evaluated our method on the Pascal VOC and Willow Object datasets, focusing on scenarios involving point occlusion and random outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all tested scenarios, highlighting the accuracy and robustness of our method.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Clarity of the approach is poor. The most important weakness is the presentation of the proposed approach in Section 3.1. This lowers the chances of the proposed approach to reproduce the results. First, there is no high-level description of the proposed approach, and as a reader we have to figure out from the mathematical description and non-informative narrative. For instance, in line 197, the term \u201cground truth universe matching\u201d and symbol X^gt_iu is never properly defined, and ultimately the paragraph says that it uses ground truth pairwise matching X^gt_ij. Second, lines 224-227 states that \u201ckeypoints from different categories are mapped to the same universe node\u201d. I don\u2019t think this makes sense, because this will make the network confuse categories. Right? Lastly, it is also unclear why an attention-based approach could not be used. Attention can be useful also in rejecting outliers. In fact there are previous approaches derived for feature matching (e.g., LoFTR [C]).\n\n2. The proposed formulation requires the use of class information. This prevents the generalization to other matching problems (e.g., feature matching for geometric problems such as in 3D reconstruction or stereo matching).\n\n3. Outlier detection mechanism is weak. This is because it is based on thresholding the similarity information which can cause it to reject correct matches; consider the case where a wheel from a bike gets confused with a wheel from a car. This mechanism seems to be ad-hoc. Why not learn a function to detect these? I can imagine learning a function that turns off the similarity entry in the affinity matrix. The ground-truth could be easily generated by assigning a node of class A to class B, and perhaps more fruitful if A and B share visual similarities.\n\n4. Experiments are incomplete. First, the experiments are missing recent benchmarks: IMC-PT-SparseGM benchmark [A] and only showing two benchmarks in my opinion falls short of truly showing convincing evidence of the proposed method performance. Second, some of the baselines on the presented benchmarks do not contain the SOTA methods (e.g., [B]) and report different metrics from those reported in [B], where the COMMON method achieves a high accuracy rating on the Willow dataset. Lastly, the ablation studies are quite small. They are missing threshold value performance, m_in, and m_out, as well as temperature T. What values were used for the ablation and experiments?\n\nReferences:\nA.

The results are then combined to obtain the final matching (A \u2192 B). This approach effectively decomposes the ambiguous partial matching problem into two well-defined subgraph matching tasks. For the second problem, a margin loss is applied to increase the energy distribution difference between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data."
