    "title": "RGB-Event ISP: The Dataset and Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Event-guided imaging has received significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize instant imaging systems. However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with $2248\\times 3264$ resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a convential ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This convential ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g., demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community.",

                "value": "This paper, as a work primarily contributing a dataset, provides insufficient information about the dataset itself and focuses heavily on performance comparisons with existing methods, but the proposed method fails to outperform the current ones across all metrics. The overall logic and structure of the paper need improvement and refinement.\n1. As a dataset-centric paper, it presents too few sample images, making it difficult for readers to intuitively grasp the specific content of the dataset and the differences in the scenes, camera shots, and exposure modes mentioned.\n2. The introduction to the specific content of the dataset is insufficient. It is recommended to list statistical information about the dataset regarding the mentioned types and present them in tables.\n3. The ISP presented in the paper is used to handle demosaicing, white balance, denoising, and color space transformations, but its capabilities in handling these tasks are not reflected in the performance analysis results.\n4. Figures 6 and 7 have identical legends and can be combined into one figure, or one could be replaced with the visualization results of indoor data samples.\n5. The experimental section only presents quantitative analysis results for outdoor and indoor data separately, failing to reflect the overall performance of the dataset.\n6. The presented integrated improvement method does not enhance processing performance, and the paper does not provide sufficient explanation or analysis of this issue.\n7. The experimental visual results are too few, and the layout is too compact, making it difficult for readers to intuitively appreciate the value of the dataset.\n8. It is recommended to analyze the performance of different types of samples within the dataset using the same method in future work, rather than focusing primarily on comparing the performance of multiple ISP methods."

Additionally, the authors could include suggestions in the future work section on strategies for scaling up the dataset.\n2.\tReproducibility and Usage of the dataset: Given that this is a dataset/benchmark paper, I strongly encourage the authors to release the data as soon as possible, even during the review stage. Early access is crucial for the community to begin evaluating and utilizing the dataset.\n3.\tBenchmark Task: This dataset is tailored for RAW-Event ISP tasks. So, I wonder if we should focus more on designing various Event-guided ISP baselines. In the current setup, most baselines do not utilize the event data, raising concerns about whether these limited event-guided baselines effectively demonstrate the dataset\u2019s potential. I believe increasing the variety of event-driven baselines could better validate the usefulness of this dataset and highlight its unique contributions to event-guided ISP research."

For instance, could you explore a wider variety of event-guided architectures or fusion methods to better showcase the potential of the event data in ISP?"

However, the dataset's scale is quite limited, with only 3,373 samples, which may not be sufficient to support data-driven learning methods. This raises concerns about the dataset's ability to serve as a professional, standardized, and challenging benchmark. If this is primarily a workload issue, could the authors consider generating some simulated datasets? I would appreciate an explanation regarding this.\n\n2. The authors use images generated from a controllable ISP framework based on MATLAB as ground truth. While they provide extensive explanations for this approach, it is difficult to trust software-generated images as ground truth, especially for a professional dataset. This practice differs significantly from the ground truth methods used by existing sensor or smartphone manufacturers for their ISPs.\n\n3. The integration of events into traditional ISP theoretically brings certain advantages, and the authors should elaborate on these benefits. Additionally, to demonstrate the advantages of event cameras, the authors should showcase scenes, particularly under high-speed motion or extreme lighting conditions, that highlight the potential benefits of using event-based approaches."

In Section 3.1, it would be helpful to elaborate on the role of event data in each ISP stage (e.g., how it improves demosaicing or color correction compared to using RAW data alone).\n2. There are some spelling errors in the paper. For instance, both \"convential ISP pipeline\" and \"conventional ISP pipeline\" appear, where \"convential\" is incorrect; it should be \"conventional ISP pipeline.\" Additionally, in Figure 5c, the y-axis should be labeled as \"probability density,\" but the word \"density\" seems to have been omitted. \n3. My concern is that some comparative algorithms have very low PSNR scores. From the varying performance of PyNET and UNet under different hyperparameters, I believe it would also be beneficial to test CameraNet with different hyperparameters. This would allow us to select a high-performance configuration as a baseline, ensuring a fairer and more comprehensive comparison.\n4. I have a question regarding the alignment between APS (Active Pixel Sensor) and EVS (Event-based Vision Sensor) data. As mentioned in the paper, there is a significant difference in their frame rates. How is the event data aligned with the RAW data given this disparity in FPS?"
