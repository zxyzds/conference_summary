    "title": "Learn out of the box: optimizing both diversity and performance in Offline Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "In offline reinforcement learning, most existing methods have focused primarily on optimizing performance, often neglecting the promotion of diverse behaviors. While some approaches generate diverse behaviors from well-constructed, heterogeneous datasets, their effectiveness is significantly reduced when applied to less diverse data. To address this, we introduce a novel intrinsic reward mechanism that encourages behavioral diversity, irrespective of the dataset's heterogeneity. By maximizing the mutual information between actions and policies under each state, our approach enables agents to learn a variety of behaviors, including those not explicitly represented in the data. Although performing out-of-distribution actions can lead to risky outcomes, we mitigate this risk by incorporating the ensemble-diversified actor-critic (EDAC) method to estimate Q-value uncertainty, preventing agents from adopting suboptimal behaviors. Through experiments using the D4RL benchmarks on MuJoCo tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves behavioral diversity while maintaining performance across environments constructed from both heterogeneous and homogeneous datasets.",

If I understand correctly, In Line205-208, $p^t(s_t|pi)$ is $p(s_t|s_{t-1},a_{t-1})$ and is nothing to do with $\\pi$ (since you have specified \\tau in $p(\\tau|\\pi)$, it can decompose to transition probability $p(s_t| s_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$ and $p(a_t|s_t, \\pi)$ for t=0,1,...). Based on this, I think there may be some mistakes in the following analysis.\n\nQ3. In practice, how to estimate $p(a_t|s_t)$ in Equation 8?\n\n\nQ4. Can the experimental results be generalized to tasks with discrete action spaces, such as Atari, representing more complex environments? It would be advantageous if the methods could be validated more broadly.\n\nQ5. The authors employ ensemble training in the experiments. Could we consider incorporating information between the policies to achieve final diversity, as done in [1]? \n\n[1] Wu S et al.

                "value": "1. The phrase 'out of the box' in the title is not clearly connected to specific concepts or points within the paper. The authors should clarify what 'box' refers to in the context of their method. \n2. Regarding the abstract, after reviewing the full paper, I found that the comparison between heterogeneous and less diverse datasets is not explicitly addressed in the methodology or experiments. The claimed effectiveness of the approach across different data types has not been adequately substantiated. Could the authors specify which datasets are considered heterogeneous and which are less diverse, and clarify this distinction in the methodology or experiment sections?\n3. How important is diversity for reinforcement learning, particularly in offline RL? What are the main benefits of promoting diversity in this context? The authors should elaborate more on the significance and implications of this aspect in their research.\n4. What distinguishes the current mutual information-based approach from other methods, including the baseline approaches like DIVEOFF, CLUE, and SORL? The authors mention that DIVEOFF also maximizes mutual information, so why does their method achieve better diversity while balancing performance? What is the underlying reason for this difference?\n5. Regarding Figure 1, the comparison between the proposed method and SORL does not show a significant difference. In my view, their diversity levels appear quite similar. Could the authors provide another example where the distinction between the methods is more pronounced?\n6. Why does the approach adopt an ensemble method (EDAC) to avoid over-estimation? How does this compare to other techniques like conservative Q-learning or conservative policy gradient methods? What are the advantages of using EDAC over these alternatives?\n7. The paper states, \"However, a challenge arises when the dataset is homogeneous, or when distant latent vectors are decoded into similar actions.\" What exactly does it mean for distant vectors to be decoded into similar actions? Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation of this concept?\n8. The paper states, \"Agents are rewarded for behaving differently from each other during training, providing direct guidance that allows policies to learn behaviors even beyond the dataset distribution.\" Why does the proposed method enable learning behaviors beyond the dataset distribution? How does this approach differ from importance sampling-based methods, and why did the authors choose not to use importance sampling?\n9. The estimation formula $p\\left(a_t \\mid s_t\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^M p\\left(a_t \\mid s_t, \\pi^i\\right) p\\left(\\pi^i\\right)$ on page 5 is intriguing, but can it truly provide an accurate estimate of $p\\left(a_t \\mid s_t\\right)$? Are there any potential issues with bias or high variance in this approach? The same concern applies to the formula $p^t\\left(s_t\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^M p^t\\left(s_t \\mid \\pi^i\\right) p\\left(\\pi^i\\right)$. Could the authors explain the rationale behind using these estimations? If this method is derived from existing research, it would be helpful to cite those sources and provide further clarification.\n10. In Inequation (8), is the second term of $U_{\\text{Path}}^{\\pi_{\\theta}^i}(\\tau) = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\log \\left( \\frac{p(a_t \\mid s_t, \\pi^i)}{p(a_t \\mid s_t)} \\right) + \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\log \\left( \\frac{p^t(s_t \\mid \\pi^i)}{p^t(s_t)} \\right)$ always positive? It is not clear to me why this inequation holds. Could the authors provide further explanation?\n11. To which part of the paper does Figure 2 correspond? The authors did not clearly indicate this connection.\n12. In Algorithm 1, how is the policy update in line 8 implemented? Did you use the policy gradient theorem? The authors should provide more details on how the policies are updated.\n13. The notation $\\phi(\\pi_i) = E_{s \\sim \\pi_i, P}[s]$ is used to evaluate state diversity, while $\\phi(\\pi_i) = E_{s \\sim \\pi_i, P}[a]$ is used to assess action diversity. However, it appears that the same notation $\\phi(\\pi_i)$ is being used for two different values. Could the authors clarify this?\n14. In Table 4, the performance of the EDAC method appears to be better than that of the proposed approach. Under what conditions should we choose the proposed method for its diversity benefits, despite the lower performance compared to EDAC? Is there a standard metric or conventional score to evaluate this trade-off between diversity and performance?\n15. I noticed that the proposed method appears to outperform DIVEOFF, SORL, and CLUE in both performance and diversity. Could the authors also evaluate the diversity of other high-performance algorithms, such as EDAC, CQL, and IQL? Furthermore, are the observed differences in actions genuinely due to enhanced diversity, or could they be attributed to insufficient training of the policies (e.g., SORL), which may have been limited to a single, suboptimal policy?\n16. Is this method applicable only to offline learning? If not, please consider discussing its potential for online scenarios in the future work section."
