    "title": "GroupCoOp: Group-robust Fine-tuning via Group Prompt Learning",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs) excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs without group labels. Its key idea is to employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in the embedding space. Moreover, we propose a simple yet fairly effective pseudo group labeling algorithm, which allows GroupCoOp to fine-tune VLMs without manual group labels. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures and even outperformed prior methods that train the entire network, despite training only 0.016\\% of the network's parameters. GroupCoOp demonstrates robust performance even with extremely limited training samples, where the minority group sample is limited to a single instance.",

                "value": "This paper combines the strategies of group prompts and pseudo-label generation to achieve debiased optimization, speciafically without explicit group labels, thereby improving group robustness. The proposed method significantly reduces computational requirements by fine-tuning a very small number of parameters (only 0.016%), but shows results close to or even exceeding those of the full model fine-tuning method on multiple datasets, showing extremely high parameter efficiency. The experimental results verify the robustness performance on minority groups on multiple datasets, which is better than some existing debias-based  algorithms, showing its effectiveness in solving group imbalance and bias problems."

                "value": "1. The paper fails to fully explore the motivation, especially why existing VLMs are susceptible to group bias during the fine-tuning stage. Although the paper mentions that existing methods have bias problems, there is no specific analysis of the causes of the bias, nor is there a discussion of the differences in performance across tasks. In addition, the difference between this paper's method and previous methods is not clearly stated, and there is a lack of theoretical or practical evidence to support the proposed debiasing strategy.\n2. The writing of the method section is quite inadequate. The paper should ensure that all the audience can clearly understand its content, but the questions raised in this paper require readers to consult a large number of references to understand, resulting in unclear expression. It is recommended to provide more detailed explanations of key concepts and methods to improve readability.\n3. The subscript of Fig. 1 seems inconsistent with the meaning expressed in lines 186-187 and 215. It is recommended to check the chart and text description to ensure consistency and accuracy to avoid confusion for readers.\n4. The experimental section lacks qualitative analysis of the results, and does not provide visualization or in-depth explanation of the specific role of group prompts and pseudo-label generation in reducing bias. Specifically, it is unclear where the proposed text prompt plays a role. Although the visualization results of the category classification are provided in the supplementary materials, this is not enough to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results may have errors in parameter settings or code implementation. It is recommended to further verify the reliability of the experimental results.\n5. The proposed method is relatively naive, although it seems effective, while the author did not show the good analysis of the problems and results. As far as I know, leveraging the extra learnable components is very conventional and also popular direction[1,2,3]. So the author could refer to more top-tier papers to learn how to well present and support a good idea. For example, considering the group problems, I would suggest you to mathematically visualise some key points to show the problem and analysis, which could enhance the contributions and significance of the method.\n\n[1] Liu, S., Zeng, Z., Ren, T., Li, F., Zhang, H., Yang, J., Li, C., Yang, J., Su, H., Zhu, J. and Zhang, L., 2023.

Numerous existing studies tackle distribution shift or domain gap challenges for VLMs, so it would be valuable to clarify how this work stands out.\n\n- GroupCoOp leverages CoOp's prompt-tuning framework but extends it to incorporate group-specific prompts aimed at subgroup-level classification. However, while this approach is indeed unique in how it applies prompt-based tuning to groups, its novelty could be perceived as limited without specific comparisons. It would be beneficial to discuss aspects of GroupCoOp that differentiate it from existing subgroup classification strategies within prompt learning frameworks, such as CoOp-CSC or even ERM-based methods that employ subgroup recognition. Including these comparisons would help clarify the novel contributions of the method, particularly how GroupCoOp advances beyond traditional class-based prompts.\n\n- The structure of the 'Proposed Method' section could be enhanced by providing a clearer breakdown of the GroupCoOp pipeline, specifically the inference process. For instance, it would be useful to clarify how group-specific prompts are generated and matched against test images, particularly highlighting steps such as calculating cosine similarity with group vectors and selecting the final prediction. \n\n- Overall, GroupCoOp doesn\u2019t seem to introduce a fundamentally new idea to address major limitations of VLMs."

Additionally, it would be beneficial to ensure consistency regarding the benchmarks used. Specifically, clarifying whether four or five datasets were used in the final evaluation would address any ambiguity and make the experimental setup clearer.\n\n- GroupCoOp currently distinguishes only two groups per class. Could it be extended to capture finer intra-class variations by further subdividing each class?\n\n- The benchmarks used in the experiments involve two classes, resulting in four possible combinations of class and spurious attribute. How would GroupCoOp's performance vary when tested with a greater number of classes and attributes?"

I wonder whether group-wise Adapter/LoRA (i.e., use group label as the text input and train a set of Adapter/LoRA on the text encoder for each group) leads to similar results as GroupCoOp, since Adapter/LoRA are proved to be more effective than prompt tuning in transformer-based models.\n2.

Nevertheless the experimental result is opposite. However, the explanation in line 517 cannot convince me, since class imbalance can be adjusted by sampling or logit adjustment technique. I recommend the authors to provide more empirical analysis (e.g., extend Fig. 4 by comparison between group result from GroupCoOp and that from k-means, or classical failure cases) to prove the effectiveness of GroupCoOp pseudo labeling strategy. Moreover, theoretical proof of why GroupCoOp is better than k-means is also preferred (optional)."
