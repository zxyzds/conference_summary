    "abstract": "Handling missing data is a major challenge in machine learning where missing values are common in datasets. This work introduces a hypergraph representation constructed from datasets containing missing values. The method does not rely on traditional techniques like deletion or data imputations. The approach constructs hypergraphs directly from the dataset, preserving the relationships between variables and modeling multi-variable interactions. This enables the model to capture the dataset structure in ways other methods may overlook. The proposed hypergraph learning method can be applied to classification and regression tasks. For real-world evaluation, we use the MIMIC-III and Adult datasets focusing on classification performance. Additionally, synthetic datasets with controlled missingness are used to evaluate the method's effectiveness across varying degrees of missingness. When compared with imputation and prediction techniques, the hypergraph approach achieves competitive or superior performance. Specifically, our method maintains high performance in scenarios with significant levels of missing data. We demonstrate that the hypergraph representation not only offers a more resilient framework for learning from datasets with missing data. But also scales effectively across diverse datasets and prediction tasks. The method maintains stable performance under various degrees of missingness, demonstrating its potential as a valuable machine learning tool with high data reliability and prediction quality.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Lack of logical structure in the introduction: The introduction fails to effectively highlight the goal of the research. While the motivations for the study are present, they are scattered throughout the section\n\n- Insufficient comparison with recent studies: The paper lacks a dedicated related work section. While a related work section is not always necessary if it was already integrated into the introduction, I don't think that is the case here. Also, the studies mentioned are outdated. The authors should include more recent and sophisticated methods for missing data imputation in both the literature review and experiments.\n\n- Unclear description of the proposed method: I am sorry. I am not particularly familiar with hypergraphs, but I think the explanation of hypergraph construction and inference is insufficient. Without a clear understanding of the methodology, it was challenging to assess the paper's true contribution. Moreover, I think there might be a discrepancy between the motivation and the proposed method. The authors argue that previous research is limited in the use of pairwise connectivity, but the proposed method also seems to use pairwise connections in its hypergraph structure. The only difference I noted is that the proposed method excludes irrelevant features, but I don't think this is an inherent property of hypergraphs.\n\n- Limited experiments: Although the authors attempted to demonstrate practicality by using realistic datasets like MIMIC-III, the evaluation lacks diversity. The authors should include more benchmark datasets, as is typical in missing data imputation research, to demonstrate the method's superiority. Additionally, authors can simulate missing data in realistic datasets by intentionally removing values to test the method's robustness. I think the generated synthetic data is somewhat ideal in that features are too relevant so it is not appropriate to assess true robustness, particularly for higher missing rates."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Could you provide more details on how the hypergraph is constructed and how it helps capture higher-order relationships beyond pairwise interactions? This would help highlight the method's strengths more effectively.\n\n2. Why did you choose simple prediction methods with hypergraphs? I think this simplicity can be a bottleneck for the proposed method. I would like to understand why you concluded that these simple prediction methods are enough.\n\n3. As I know, MIMIC-III is not highly structured. If so, it may contain natural missingness, and imputing these missing values is undesirable. With other imputation-based methods, distinguishing between natural and unintended missingness is challenging. Is your hypergraph-based method particularly helpful in such situation?"

The paper defines hyperedges as collections of samples with the same missing patterns, but it lacks sufficient explanation and examples of these patterns. In the hypergraph inference section, the calculations for single-neighbor nodes and multi-neighbor nodes are expressed through two formulas, which essentially represent the same algorithm, making it overly redundant.\n\n3. The paper uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure relationships between nodes but lacks an explanation of this metric and the rationale for its selection."

Each distinct missingness pattern forms a unique hyperedge $e_i$, and the weight of each hyperedge is assigned according to the number of samples contributing to its construction.\" Maybe the authors could take an example. \n- I also do not understand how the regression coefficients $\\beta$ are computed. Only on observed samples ? \n\nExperimental study: \n- The authors introduce the missing-data mechanisms but do not mention it in the experimental study. How have missing data been simulated ? \n- The authors compare their method with the mean imputation, KNN imputation and MICE. Line 307 some references are not given. The method should be compared with other imputation methods, like missForest which is widely used. \nStekhoven, Daniel J., and Peter B\u00fchlmann. \"MissForest\u2014non-parametric missing value imputation for mixed-type data.\" Bioinformatics 28.1 (2012): 112-118.\n\nPresentation:  \nAs it is, it's difficult to read the article.\n- Some sentences are unfinished: for example line 66: When large portions of the dataset are missing.\n- The authors can use \\citep and \\citet with the natbib package in LaTex to cite the works in a sentence.
