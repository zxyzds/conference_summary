    "title": "Leveraging metapaths for learning from knowledge graphs in the context of vision-based classification of object states",
    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Object State Classification (ZS-OSC) aims to recognize unseen object states without any visual training examples. Existing methods typically rely on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide semantic information about states, but they often treat KGs as homogeneous, overlooking the rich relational knowledge encoded in their structure. We propose a novel approach to ZS-OSC that leverages meta-paths to capture complex relationships between object states in a KG. Our method learns to project semantic information from the KG into the visual space via meta-path learning, generating discriminative visual embeddings for unseen state classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize meta-paths for ZS-OSC. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach compared to SoTA zero-shot learning methods and a graph-based baseline. Our ablation study further provides insights into the impact of key design choices on the effectiveness of our method.",

Therefore, the motivation of this paper is quite weak, which will significantly impact my final evaluation.\n\n2. While an ablation study is presented, it only explores a narrow set of hyperparameters related to meta-path length, the number of softmax channels, and learning rates. Other critical factors such as embedding dimensions, network depth, and the impact of different types of meta-paths are not examined. Additionally, the study does not provide insights into the underlying reasons for the observed performance changes, limiting its usefulness in understanding the model's behavior.\n\n3. The comparison is limited to a baseline graph-based method and a few large pre-trained models, without including other relevant state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot learning or knowledge graph utilization. The analysis of the results is superficial, lacking in-depth discussion on why the proposed method performs better and under what conditions it might fail."

Improving the accessibility and clarity of the manuscript is crucial before considering it for publication. Here are some key areas for improvement:\n1. The authors should dedicate space to formally define the zero-shot Object State Classification problem within the paper. Given its relevance in the current landscape, a comprehensive definition in the methodology section is essential. Additionally, providing detailed explanations about Object State Classification, including its inputs and outputs, would enhance understanding.\n2. Although the paper elaborates on learning a meta-path-based graph network, it falls short in clearly articulating how this network is applied in object state classification and zero-shot object state classification.\n3. While heterogeneous modeling is deemed critical for object state classification, the paper lacks substantial evidence to support the assertion that meta-path learning effectively introduces heterogeneous information. The motivation behind choosing meta-path learning over other techniques remains insufficiently justified. Including experimental comparisons with alternative methods could strengthen the argument.\n4. The authors should address why meta-path learning specifically benefits zero-shot Object State Classification. While heterogeneous modeling is crucial for object state classification, the connection between meta-path learning and the zero-shot context needs clarification."

We are curious about the detailed analysis of the current state of research and key challenges in state classification, otherwise, this would not justify the author's statement \u201cThis highlights a need for dedicated methods tailored to the unique challenges of state recognition\u201d.\n\n- As the authors note, existing ZSC methods primarily address a CZSL variant of the problem, which generalizes to unseen combinations of object and state primitives by learning the compositionality of object and state primitives from the training set. This approach is clearly more reasonable than focusing only on state classification, since isn't state classification ultimately in the service of object classification? Could the authors please clarify what is the point of focusing only on state categorization? Alternatively, are the authors trying to show that state categorization can be achieved without relying on prior knowledge of object categories? Could the authors please focus on the uniqueness of this study that distinguishes it from existing studies on ZSC, other than the introduction of meta-path learning?\n\n- The authors are advised to elaborate on the meta-path selection process, including how meta-paths are identified based on the structure of the knowledge graph and task requirements, and how the effectiveness of different meta-paths is evaluated. The authors mention in the conclusion that the approach in this paper utilizes the structure of KGs and visual embedding to guide the learning of meta-paths, but this is not clearly reflected in the methods section.\n\n- The authors' key rationale for introducing meta-path learning into zero-shot object state classification is that meta-path learning can effectively capture and utilize specific semantic relationships in KGs, but there is no analysis of the rationale and a lack of corresponding visual representation. In addition, I can't see the changes in the features of the GTN trained based on meta-path learning when it is used in object state classification. Case studies demonstrating how meta-path learning helps in classifying challenging examples.\n\n- Figures are less readable. For example, the font in Figure 1 is too small to read."
