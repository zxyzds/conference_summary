    "title": "Simple yet Effective Incomplete Multi-view Clustering: Similarity-level Imputation and Intra-view Hybrid-group Prototype Construction",
    "abstract": "Most of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) methods typically choose to ignore the missing samples and only utilize observed unpaired samples to construct  bipartite similarity. Moreover, they employ a single quantity of prototypes to extract the information of $\\textbf{all}$ views.   To eliminate these drawbacks, we present a simple yet effective IMVC approach, SIIHPC, in this work. It firstly transforms partial bipartition learning into original sample form by virtue of   reconstruction concept to split out of observed similarity, and then loosens traditional non-negative constraints via regularizing samples to more freely characterize the similarity.  Subsequently, it learns to recover the incomplete parts by utilizing the connection built between the similarity exclusive on respective view and the consensus graph shared for all views. On this foundation,  it further introduces a group of hybrid prototype quantities for each individual view to flexibly extract the data features   belonging to each view itself.  Accordingly, the resulting graphs are with various scales and  describe the overall similarity more comprehensively. It is worth mentioning that these all are optimized in one unified learning framework, \nwhich makes it possible for them to  reciprocally promote. Then, to effectively solve the formulated optimization problem, we design an ingenious auxiliary function that is with theoretically proven monotonic-increasing properties.  Finally, the clustering results are obtained by implementing spectral grouping action on the eigenvectors  of stacked multi-scale consensus similarity.  Numerous experimental results demonstrate that even under diverse missing proportions, the proposed SIIHPC  is still able to provide a preferable clustering performance compared to multiple prominent IMVC methods.",

                "value": "The paper presents a novel approach SIIHPC to incomplete multi-view clustering through similarity-level imputation, which diverges from conventional methods that focus on reconstructing missing samples or features. This approach serves as an efficient alternative to traditional recovery-based techniques. By addressing incomplete multi-view clustering without explicit missing view imputation, SIIHPC reduces computational overhead and allows clustering methods to function effectively without relying on fully complete data structures.\n\nA key innovation of the paper is the introduction of hybrid-group prototype construction, which replaces single prototypes with a more flexible model that enables each view to capture unique features. This enhances the model\u2019s adaptability to heterogeneous data views, improving clustering performance across diverse datasets and scenarios.\n\nExtensive experimental evaluations on multiple datasets with varying missing ratios highlight the robustness and effectiveness of SIIHPC. The inclusion of ablation studies further enriches the assessment, providing valuable insights into the contribution of each component to the model's overall performance and validating the framework\u2019s design choices."

Specifically, the final steps for obtaining clustering results and the initialization settings for relevant parameters should be clearly defined to improve the reader's understanding of the algorithm\u2019s workflow.\n\nWhile the paper provides strong experimental results, the interpretability of the clustering outputs and the practical implications of hybrid-group prototypes could be explored further.

They propose a method that employs a hybrid approach to extract data representations, utilizing multiple quantities of prototypes for each individual view rather than relying on a single quantity across all views. This approach effectively resolves the misalignment of observed samples and incorporates potentially useful information from the missing samples into the bipartition similarity. Additionally, the authors balance contributions from different views while defining overall similarity based on the intrinsic characteristics of each view. These goals are effectively realized within a cohesive learning framework. The proposed method's effectiveness is convincingly demonstrated through experimental results on six public datasets with varying missing ratios."
