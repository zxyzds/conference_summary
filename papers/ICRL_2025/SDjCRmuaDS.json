    "title": "MolMiner: Transformer architecture for fragment-based autoregressive generation of molecular stories",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models for molecular discovery have become a very popular choice in new high-throughput screening paradigms. These models have been developed inheriting from the advances in natural language processing and computer vision, achieving ever greater results. However, generative molecular modelling has unique challenges that are often overlooked. Chemical validity, interpretability of the generation process and flexibility to variable molecular sizes are among some of the remaining challenges for generative models in computational materials design. In this work, we propose an autoregressive approach that decomposes molecular generation into a sequence of discrete and interpretable steps using molecular fragments as units, a 'molecular story'. Enforcing chemical rules in the stories guarantees the chemical validity of the generated molecules, the discrete sequential steps of a molecular story makes the process transparent improving interpretability, and the autoregressive nature of the approach allows the size of the molecule to be a decision of the model. We demonstrate the validity of the approach in a multi-target inverse design of electroactive organic compounds, focusing on the target properties of solubility, redox potential, and synthetic accessibility. Our results show that the model can effectively bias the generation distribution according to the prompted multi-target objective.",

The key technical contribution is not clear. I suggest the authors carefully rephrase the scoop and technical contribution of the proposed method. Specifically, I agree that the fragmentization of large molecules could be the key to enabling flexible generation.  In contrast, the five points of the introduction are not convincing to me.  For example, the paper states that the Molminer differs from the diffusion-based approach, e.g. HierDiff [1], in the fact that it could enable flexible node numbers during generation; I would consider this more as a different feature instead of the benefits. For example, HierDiff[1] also states the motivation of non-autoregressive generation over autoregressive generation in the sense of global modeling, etc. Unfortunately, I do not see any empirical evidence to compare and justify any of the proposed advantages. \n\n\n2. The evaluation parts are not comprehensive enough. Specifically, there is no baseline to compare in the experiment section which makes it very hard for me to assess the model from a systemic work perspective. From a method-oriented perspective, I am quite confused over the novelty of several important components of the proposed framework. What is the exact difference between the introduced Fragmentization procedure in Algorithm 1 and the corresponding fragmentization of previous work such as JT-VAE/HierDiff? And the training objective is a widely applied approximation for graph modeling, then I would like to consider the key novelty that originates from the network structure parts. The key components of the networks is the geometry parts which differ from previous graph transformers, however, after carefully checking the ablation in Table 1. I find that with no-geometry, the model could still perform very well, then what is the point of involving such information and increasing the complexity? \n\n3. Some important related works for 2D fragment-based autoregressive generation of molecules are missing [2] \n\n[1] Coarse-to-Fine: a Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Molecule Generation in 3D \n[2] MARS: Markov Molecular Sampling for Multi-objective Drug Discovery"

Experiments do not demonstrate the approach's advantages compared to existing methods or explain design choices made (hence why low \"soundness\" score).\nThe experiments do not consider any baselines, such as the alternative fragment-based approaches discussed (such as Jin et al., 2019, 2020) or non-fragment-based approaches (such as G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli et al., 2018). It is therefore hard to gauge how useful MolMiner would be and what advantages it offers over existing, already established approaches.\nMoreover, I also have a hard time distinguishing the importance of the design choices made, e.g., the incorporation of 3D information  (lines 256-258) or the semi-order agnostic serialization method proposed (line 263). (Information on 3D information is shown in Table 2 of the appendix, but it seems to only be in terms of accuracy, rather than the effect on optimization, and the effect seems fairly minor).\n\n# W2. The method for optimizing molecules (based on picking an initial fragment according to how well it is modeled to affect a particular property score) seems like it is unlikely to scale to more interesting optimization tasks.\nMy current understanding of the optimization method (lines 380-386) is that it involves learning a feed forward neural network to pick the initial fragment, but that the rest of the fragment generation process happens as usual. For harder optimization tasks, I worry that other parts of the molecule will also be important and so this method is unlikely to scale.\n\n# W3. Novelty of method (modeling molecules via generating fragments) seems low and I would have liked to have seen the differences to these approaches better studied or discussed. (hence why low \"contribution\"/\"presentation\" score).\nThere are several existing approaches to generating molecules that take a fragment based approach. Examples include the cited Jin et al. (2019, 2020) as well as others such as:\n- Marco Podda, Davide Bacciu, Alessio Micheli (2020) 'A Deep Generative Model for Fragment-Based Molecule Generation' AISTATS 2020.\n- Bengio, E., Jain, M., Korablyov, M., Precup, D. and Bengio, Y.

(Is this the fragment-level reconstruction accuracy?)\n2. What is the \"GetSSSR\" function on line 110?\n3. I'm a little confused as to the remapping procedure described in section 2.2. Why not just use atom map numbers in the SMILES to define the attachment points? (I think my main confusion is around how the symmetries are dealt with. Are all points that are symmetrically the same maintained as attachment points or is just one chosen?)\n4. I just wanted to check if I understood the notation $\\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{M}))$ in Equation 1 correctly. Is this a uniform distribution over all possible stories? How important is this sampling for performance (compared to e.g. using a fixed ordering across all epochs, or restricting the number of possible orders by using a depth first search).\n5. The datasets used seem quite small (~8500 molecules used for training). Does this limit the number of fragments observed and how big was the resultant fragment vocabulary?"

The integration of chemical rules during generation to enforce validity is another well-executed innovation that strengthens the quality of the model. These aspects collectively offer a comprehensive and robust approach, improving upon limitations seen in previous one-shot or black-box generative models.\n\nThe empirical results are also well-supported, with extensive experiments that validate the model's ability to generate novel molecules aligned with desired properties.
