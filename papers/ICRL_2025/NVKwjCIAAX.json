    "title": "Adaptive Constraint Integration for Simultaneously Optimizing Crystal Structures with Multiple Targeted Properties",
    "abstract": "In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a new method for multi-property optimization of materials called Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS). SMOACS uses the gradients from neural network based property prediction to optimize materials structures within preset constraints. The paper first introduces the motivation for multi-property materials design that can be constrained for certain types of materials, such as perovskites. The paper also details the important of charge neutrality in materials design, which later becomes a consideration for the proposed design formulation. The introduction also describes past advances in related materials generation methods, such as generative models and bayesian optimization. In Section 2, the paper describes related works focusing on property prediction models, deep generative models and bayesian optimization providing further context for the introduction.\n\nSection 3 of the paper describes the relevant details for SMOACS, including the concrete details of the how the crystal design is constructed along lattice constants and angles, oxidation state, atomic sites and elements. To maintain charge neutrality, the paper proposes a masking method to restrict the actions related to the oxidation state which is described in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 outlines the details of multi-property optimization using training signals from neural network based property prediction models and Section 3.3 describes how SMOACS maintains predefined crystal structures by limiting the range of certain design variables.\n\nSection 4 details the experiments of the paper, including the property prediction models used for the SMOACS algorithm (ALIGNN and Crystalformer). Section 4.2 outlines an experiments without constraints on the crystal structure and Section 4.3 details an experiment with crystal structures constrained to perovskites. In both cases, SMOACS shows general outperformance compared to the Bayesian optimization-based baselines. In addition to the design experiments described in the paper, the authors perform DFT verification of the band gaps of two of the materials designed by SMOACS which showed some agreements and discrepancy. Section 5 consists of a conclusion that summarizes the main findings of the paper"

A key feature of the method is that, for any given oxidation pattern, the atoms populating the N sites are restricted to adhere to that particular pattern in order to ensure electrical neutrality. With this constraint in place, the method is essentially a first-order gradient-based optimization algorithm with gradients obtained by auto-differentiating the predictive ML models w.r.t. their inputs."

                "value": "* In the numerical evaluation the authors show a high \u201csuccess rate\u201d for SMOACS, which is a metric tailored to the specific properties that are optimized and/or hard-coded into the proposed methods. However, it was not clear to me from the description to which extent the alternative methods (optimization-based TPE and generative FTCP) explicitly target the same properties. It\u2019s mentioned in section 4.4 that TPE includes a term in the objective function for optimizing electric neutrality (except for the results in sec 4.4) but it\u2019s not clear how this is implemented. Nor is it clear how the different terms in the objective function for the different methods are weighed against each other. Since the alternative methods seem to outperform SMOACS on some metrics (e.g. TPE shows good results on BG and FTCP on E_f in Table 2), I wonder how much a better tuning of the these methods could improve the \u201csuccess rate\u201d. All in all, the numerical evaluation leaves me wondering if this is really a fair comparison.\n\n* Compared with the generative approach (FTCP), SMOACS seems to struggle to find (meta-)stable, and thus synthesizeable, materials as measured by formation energy and inter-atomic distances. Furthermore, stability of a material is a relative property not directly computable from formation energy\u2014for a material to be stable it needs to be in a more favorable energy state than competing phases---making it even harder to say that the materials found by SMOACS are potentially synthesizable. I would say that this is a limitation of the purely optimization-based approach (which only cares about optimizing the target properties of interest) compared with the generative approach (which also tries to generate structures that are \u201cin distribution\u201d, i.e. similar in some sense to the training data samples). I would have liked to see a more in-depth discussion about this limitation (??) of the proposed method.\n\n* The authors deliberately use worse property prediction models for the generative approach (FTCP). Although I appreciate the point that the authors want to make, that SMOACS easily can make use of any (differentiable!) SOTA predictive model which is not always the case for alternative approaches, I would have liked to see comparison with a generative model based on SOTA prediction networks. In particular considering that there are many training-free methods available for conditional generation (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17775 and the references therein). I am not aware of any such methods specifically for crystal generation (although I would be surprised if no such methods exists), this line of research should at least be acknowledged.\n\n* SMOACS is based on differentiating through the property prediction model w.r.t. its input. It is not clear how this handled non-differentiability of the used model. For instance, GNN-based methods typically construct a graph based on atomic distances, which means that the graph itself might change during the optimization phase of SMOACS (since you \u201cmove the atoms around\u201d).\n\n* SMOACS ensures electric neutrality by restricting the search to structures that have the same oxidation pattern as one of a given number of D templates. This seems to restrict the optimization quite a bit, and the choice of D is not discussed in the paper.\n\n* In general I found the paper quite hard to read. Specifically, it lacks a clear and concise formulation of the problem and description of the proposed method early in the paper."
