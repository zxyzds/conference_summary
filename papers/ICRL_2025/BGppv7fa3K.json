    "title": "Principal-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Orchestrating AI Agents with Contracts",
    "abstract": "The increasing deployment of AI is shaping the future landscape of the internet, which is set to become an integrated ecosystem of AI agents. Orchestrating the interaction among AI agents necessitates decentralized, self-sustaining mechanisms that harmonize the tension between individual interests and social welfare. In this paper we tackle this challenge by synergizing reinforcement learning with principal-agent theory from economics. Taken separately, the former allows unrealistic freedom of intervention, while the latter struggles to scale in sequential settings. Combining them achieves the best of both worlds. We propose a framework where a principal guides an agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using a series of contracts, which specify payments by the principal based on observable outcomes of the agent's actions. We present and analyze a meta-algorithm that iteratively optimizes the policies of the principal and agent, showing its equivalence to a contraction operator on the principal\u2019s Q-function, and its convergence to subgame-perfect equilibrium. We then scale our algorithm with deep Q-learning and analyze its convergence in the presence of approximation error, both theoretically and through experiments with randomly generated binary game-trees. Extending our framework to multiple agents, we apply our methodology to the combinatorial Coin Game. Addressing this multi-agent sequential social dilemma is a promising first step toward scaling our approach to more complex, real-world instances.",

                "value": "The paper proposes to apply principal--agent theory to multi-agent RL with the goal of applying their methods to resolve social dilemma-like situations between AI agents, allowing different AI agents to collaborate more effectively. They define principal--agent MDP as a stochastic game with turns, where at each time-step principal observes the state and chooses its action (a contract), the agent observes state and principal's action and then chooses its action. As a solution concept, they choose the subgame-perfect equilibrium. They present a meta-algorithm that is essentially a bilevel optimization problem, which when solved, proven to find the SPE in their setting. Then they propose a Q-learning based approach to instead learn the SPE rather than computing it exactly. They present an early theoretical result connecting the approximation error in Q functions to a bound on principal's utility. They test their approach in the Coin Game environment in terms of both social welfare and convergence."

                "value": "- I struggle with identifying the technical novelty and the significance of the contributions:  \n\t- From a technical standpoint, it appears that by considering SPE the problem becomes fairly simple and boils down to performing backwards induction (using standard RL techniques). In particular, as far as I can tell, the results of Theorem 3.3 and 3.4 follow straightforwardly from SPE+ well-known RL results. Could you highlight any specific novel technical challenges under the proposed problem setup? \n\t- Conceptually, the idea of a principal orchestrating agents in social dilemma to resolve miscoordination and maximize social welfare has been considered before (this is also essentially what much of mechanism design is about). In Appendix A.3, you argue that your work differs in perspective from prior work on \"solving\" social dilemmas by modifying the agents' rewards. In particular, to distinguish your work from the others you write \"While the principal effectively modifies agents\u2019 reward functions, the payments are costly.\" Are not the payments also costly in the models studied in prior work? For instance, in Yang et al. (2020), the agents transfer the rewards to other agents which is of course costly to the paying agent. Maybe the work of [Jackson and Wilkie (2002)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3700662) is also relevant / of interest here.  \n- From my undestanding, principal-agent theory is broader than just contract design, and it would be helpful to the reader to discuss this (i.e., principal-agent theory) related work as well. For instance, [Myerson (1982)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304406882900064), [Zhang and Conitzer (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06008), [Gan et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01146). There is also work on Bayesian persuasion which is part of the principal-agent problem family. Appendix A.2 does make it sound like principal-agent problems are just contract design problems."

For example, you write that \"This utility can be achieved through small(?) additional payments that counteract the agent's deviations, ...\". I'm aware that more details are provided in the appendix, but the proposition should be stated rigorously or, alternatively, be made an informal remark.  \n- In your opinion, why would the centralized orchestrating of agents (i.e., the principal-agent perspective) be more appealing to resolve incentive issues than the large-scale decentralized individual bargaining perspective many other works take?

Although a value-based method is used and is model-free, it is a primitive algorithm. Some analyses are straightforward to the community. The main contribution lies in introducing the contract mechanism and reformulating the game. \n\n- Is the contract in this work a mechanism, or is it a problem to be solved?\n    - As a problem: The contract reformulates a new game, and the logic of the experimental design is to verify that their proposed algorithm can solve this problem. So, could some other existing algorithms potentially solve this problem?\n    - As a mechanism: For instance, with this contract mechanism, the prisoner\u2019s dilemma can be effectively resolved, and the coin game can achieve high scores. In this sense, this work should compare with other algorithms to demonstrate the advantages of the contract. The experiments in Figure 2 are clearly insufficient.\n\n- The contract has a very specific meaning here, where after an agent takes an action and a result is achieved, the principal pays the agent based on the result. This setting is a variant of incentivizing agents.\n    - In this way, this setting is closely related to LIO (\"learning to incentivize other learning agents\"). The authors cited LIO but did not discuss the differences or conduct comparative experiments.\n    - In LIO, players are symmetric and do not need to wait for an optimization problem to converge at one level (in the spirit of online cross-validation). And the incentivization occurs during the training phase without changing the game\u2019s structure. So, could similar methods be directly applied?\n\n- Coin Game might not highlight the advantages of the contract. A more suitable scenario would be a task with division of labor, such as the cleanup task. There is already work on MARL contracts in this scenario, \"Formal Contracts Mitigate Social Dilemmas in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\" And LIO also uses this scenario.\n\nMinors\n- There is a large margin below Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n- Some single quotation marks in the text should be changed to double quotation marks."

This paper is well-written and well-structured. It builds up a framework with many complicated notions, but the paper managed to consider one component at a time: first it is the game itself, then an idealized solution, then function approximator (RL), and finally multi-agent. Generally, the paper is easy to follow.\n\n3.

                "value": "1. The hyperparameter, $\\alpha$ in line 406, could be tricky. As stated by the authors, $\\alpha$ is set as a heuristic approach to downweight the importance of payment minimization compared to social welfare (payment minimization cannot hurt social welfare), and thus $\\alpha$ should be set very small. However, if $\\alpha$ is indeed very close to $0$, the principal agent can simply use its reward to overwhelm all selfish intentions (e.g. sent 1% of its own reward to each individual agent, which is a very large amount for them) and the algorithm would degenerate to independent RL with cooperative objective. Thus, there exists some balance of $\\alpha$ that may require tuning. It would be better if the authors can conduct an ablation study on $\\alpha$ to show how it impacts the balance between social welfare and payment minimization.\n\n2. There is essentially only one gridworld experiment for the proposed algorithm in multi-agent RL (tree MDP in the appendix is for single-agent). It would be better if more and harder environments could also be tested, such as particle world ones (environments like SMAC-like ones would be even better for camera ready (if accepted) / next submission (if rejected)).\n\n**Minor issues**\n\n1. The notations in the beginning of Sec. 2.2 are unclear. For example, $o$ is an outcome, but is then used as a number (\"o-th coordinate of a contract\"); expressions like \"contract corresponds to the outcome $o$\" would be better.\n\n2.
