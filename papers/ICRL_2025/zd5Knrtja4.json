    "title": "TimeRAF: Retrieval-Augmented Foundation model for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in data mining, driving rapid advancements across numerous industries. \nWith the emergence of large models, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, such as zero-shot learning, through large-scale pre-training. \nMeanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods are widely employed to enhance the performance of foundation models on unseen data, allowing models to access to external knowledge. \nIn this paper, we introduce **TimeRAF**, a **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **F**orecasting model that enhance zero-shot time series forecasting through retrieval-augmented techniques.\nWe develop customized time series knowledge bases that are tailored to the specific forecasting tasks.\nTimeRAF employs an end-to-end learnable retriever to extract valuable information from the knowledge base.\nAdditionally, we propose Channel Prompting for knowledge integration, which effectively extracts relevant information from the retrieved knowledge along the channel dimension.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing significant improvement across various domains and datasets.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Channel Prompting Efficiency Concern**:  \n   If I understand correctly, **Channel Prompting** requires each channel to process and fuse information from **k retrieved time series**. This may introduce significant computational overhead, especially for datasets with many channels (e.g., **traffic data**). The paper lacks an analysis of the efficiency and scalability of this mechanism in such scenarios.  \n\n2. **Lack of Pre-training Details for TSFM**:  \n   The paper omits essential information about the **pre-training process** of the time series foundation model (TSFM), such as the **datasets used, training procedure, and loss functions**. This raises concerns about the reproducibility and transparency of the method.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation of Zero-Shot Learning**:  \n   I disagree with the zero-shot setup in the paper. True zero-shot learning implies that the model is tested on datasets it has **never seen during training**. For example, training on **ETTh1** and testing on **ETTh2** would align with this standard. However, as depicted in **Figure 2**, TimeRAF appears to fine-tune both the retriever and forecaster on parts of the test data, which **violates the principles of zero-shot forecasting**. The authors could refer to **GPT4TS or TimeLLM's zero-forecasting setup** for a more rigorous zero-shot methodology.\n\n4. **Unfair Comparison in Experiments (Table 2)**:  \n   The experiments reported in **Table 2** are not entirely fair. According to **Section 4.1**, TimeRAF uses an input length of **512**. For fair comparison, **all baselines** should have the same input length. However, the reported metrics for baselines like **iTransformer, PatchTST, and DLinear** do not correspond to **input length = 512**. I have run these models with input lengths of **512**, and the results (e.g., PatchTST on **ETTm1** with 96-step forecast: 0.292, and **ETTm2**: 0.165) differ significantly from those reported in the paper.\n\n5. **Incomplete Experimental Results**:  \n   The paper only reports results for a single forecast length (**96**). To comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeRAF, it is essential to present results for **multiple forecast horizons** (e.g., **96, 192, 336, and 720**). This would provide a more complete evaluation of the model\u2019s performance.\n\n6. **Typos and Grammar Issues**:  \n   There are several typos and grammatical errors in the paper. For example:\n     - **Lines 53-70**: \u201cour exploration of Retrieval-Augmented for time series Forecasting (RAF)\u201d is awkwardly phrased.  \n     - **Line 301**: \u201c...updating the retriever,, the whole...\u201d has an extra comma.  \n   The authors should carefully proofread the paper to improve its clarity and polish.\n\n7. **Missing Axis Labels in Figure 5**:  \n   **Figure 5** lacks a **y-axis label**, which makes it difficult to interpret the results. Proper labeling is essential for readers to understand the figures accurately.\n\n8. **Scaling Issue in Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting**:  \n   One important concern is how TimeRAF handles cases where the **retrieved time series data** are in **different magnitudes** than the input data. It would be useful if the authors could elaborate on any **normalization or scaling techniques** employed to address this issue.\n\n9. **Implementation Details for Database Usage (Section 3.3)**:  \n   The paper mentions that **non-similar data** are used during training, while **similar data** are used during inference (Section 3.3, lines 187-193). However, the specific **implementation details** of how this is done for different datasets are unclear. Providing more insights here would enhance the paper's reproducibility and understanding.\n\n10. **Lack of Code Availability**:  \n   The authors do not provide **code** for their experiments. Releasing code is crucial for **reproducibility** and would allow the community to verify the results and build upon the work."

How does TimeRAF ensure consistent scaling between retrieved external time series data and input data to avoid magnitude mismatches?\n3. Why do the authors claim a zero-shot setup if the model fine-tunes on test data? How does this setup align with the standard definition of zero-shot forecasting?\n4. What datasets and loss functions were used to pre-train the TSFM? How does the pre-training contribute to the model\u2019s performance? \n5. Can the authors provide results for other forecast lengths (e.g., 192, 336, and 720) to validate TimeRAF's generalization capability across multiple horizons?"
