    "title": "Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in causal discovery tasks by utilizing their vast expert knowledge from extensive text corpora. However, the multi-agent capabilities of LLMs in causal discovery remain underexplored. This paper introduces a general framework to investigate this potential. The first is the Meta Agents Model, which relies exclusively on reasoning and discussions among LLM agents to conduct causal discovery. The second is the Coding Agents Model, which leverages the agents\u2019 ability to plan, write, and execute code, utilizing advanced statistical libraries for causal discovery. The third is the Hybrid Model, which integrates both the Meta Agents Model and Coding Agents Model approaches, combining the statistical analysis and reasoning skills of multiple agents. Our proposed framework shows promising results by effectively utilizing LLMs\u2019 expert knowledge, reasoning capabilities, multi-agent cooperation, and statistical causal methods. By exploring the multi-agent potential of LLMs, we aim to establish a foundation for further research in utilizing LLMs multi-agent for solving causal-related problems.",

The constant stylish and grammatical imperfections also seem to suggest this paper was written in a rush. I would also recommended the authors proofread the paper and make the writing clearer. Furthermore, mechanically, I do not see how using a multi-agent setup is fundemantally better. I acknowledge that the SHD/NHD metrics were better on some models in authors' experiments, but I am not sure if (1) those improvements were large enough to be significnat; and (2) the inference cost of having more LLMs in the pipeline. I am hoping to see more supporting eveidence that the proposed framework compares favorably to existing methods.\n\n\n\n\n### Writing issues (excerpt)\n\n1. Citation missing at line 150.\n2.

MAC includes three distinct models\u2014Meta Agents Model, Coding Agents Model, and Hybrid Model\u2014each designed to leverage multi-agent interactions to enhance causal inference. The framework addresses several key challenges in causal discovery, such as harnessing agents for debate (Meta Agents Model), employing coding agents for data-driven causal graph construction (Coding Agents Model), and combining both approaches to optimize performance (Hybrid Model). The study assesses the efficacy of MAC across three datasets (Auto MPG, DWD Climate, and Sachs Protein) using metrics like Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) and Normalized Hamming Distance (NHD). Results suggest that MAC\u2019s multi-agent collaboration effectively improves LLM-based causal discovery by integrating structured debates and coding execution, with varying performance based on dataset complexity."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of Formal Framework for Agentic Workflow Convergence: Although MAC leverages multi-agent interactions for causal discovery, it lacks a formal mathematical model that defines or ensures convergence of the agents' outputs to a stable causal graph. In high-dimensional causal graphs, where causal inference is combinatorially complex, the absence of convergence guarantees can lead to oscillating or suboptimal solutions.\n\n2. Inadequate Quantification of Noise Propagation in Causal Inference: While the study qualitatively discusses errors in causal relationships and agentic noise, it lacks a quantitative model of error propagation, particularly in the Coding Agents and Hybrid Models. In causal discovery, noise in initial data or agentic decision-making can propagate through the inference process, leading to accumulated inaccuracies.\n\n3. Limited Theoretical Justification for Agent Roles and Workflow Sequencing: The paper introduces different agent roles (debate agents, coding agents) and workflows (Meta, Coding, and Hybrid Models) but lacks a theoretical basis for why certain roles or workflows are expected to perform better in specific causal inference tasks. For example, why should debates be prioritized in certain instances over coding, or vice versa? Without a rigorous framework, the choice of agent configurations appears ad hoc.\n\n4. Scalability Constraints in Token and Computational Costs: The MAC framework requires significant token and computational resources, especially in complex datasets or with high-dimensional graphs. Although the paper provides empirical token usage data, it does not propose concrete solutions for reducing token or computational overhead, limiting MAC's practical applicability to smaller datasets or high-resource settings.\n\nSummary: While MAC offers a novel multi-agent approach for LLM-based causal discovery, its theoretical framework and practical scalability are limited. The lack of formal convergence guarantees, quantification of noise propagation, and rigorous justification for agent workflows restrict its contribution to the field. Future work that addresses these theoretical gaps and practical constraints could make MAC a more impactful framework for causal discovery with LLMs."

Would integrating domain-specific statistical models or causal priors into the MAC framework improve its adaptability?\n\n2. Impact of Noise Reduction Techniques: Since causal discovery is sensitive to noise, could pre-processing techniques (e.g., noise reduction or causal regularization) improve MAC\u2019s stability in identifying causal graphs? How would the SHD and NHD scores change under varying noise levels?\n\n3. Effectiveness of Hybrid Model Configurations: Given that the Hybrid Model combines Meta-Debate and Coding Agents, what is the optimal sequencing or balance between these agents for tasks with different complexities? Would tasks benefit from a dynamic hybrid approach that adjusts the agent workflow based on intermediate inference outcomes?\n\n4. Convergence Criteria and Agentic Redundancy: Does the MAC framework have a convergence criterion to stop debate or coding cycles, especially when agents are unlikely to yield new information? What role could redundancy elimination techniques play in enhancing efficiency, and are there scenarios where additional agents create diminishing returns?"

Model selection can be challenging, even for domain experts, as algorithms often rely on different assumptions about the data, which are difficult to verify. Does the proposed method account for this when recommending an algorithm?\n- In the debate-coding module, the prompts enumerate all causal discovery methods under consideration, detailing their functions and parameters as sourced from a Python library. Will there be any potential scalability challenges, if more methods are to be included? Additionally, might the accuracy of method recommendations be impacted by the growing number of methods included in the prompts?\n- In the debate-coding module visualization in Appendix A2.2, several additional steps are included in the final suggested plan beyond implementing a causal discovery algorithm, such as interpretation, model evaluation, .etc. How are these other steps executed?\n- In the experimental results, the coding agent outperforms traditional causal discovery methods on the Sachs dataset. Could you explain the rationale behind this improvement? From my understanding, the key difference introduced by the coding agent, compared to traditional causal discovery algorithms, is the debating phase for method selection and planning. Intuitively, shouldn't the performance of the coding agent align with the direct implementation of the algorithm chosen during the debating phase?\n- In the ablation analysis section, 'Single-Agent vs. Causal Agent Debate,' what prompt is used for the single agent? If we instruct a single LLM to handle both the debating and judging processes during reasoning, would its performance be comparable to that of the multi-agent framework?\n- In the ablation analysis section, 'Eliminating the Judge,' why not include a comparison with GPT-4o mini?"

However, the hybrid approach does not consistently outperform other methods significantly.\n\nWhile multi-agent systems can enhance model performance, their effectiveness largely depends on the complexity and structure of the dataset. For example, Coding Agents perform well on moderately complex datasets, but their performance may fall short for simpler or highly complex cases. This suggests that models may require tuning or selection based on the dataset, which increases the usage barrier.\n\nDue to the iterative debugging needed in Coding Agents models during code execution, handling longer or more complex code may lead to errors or debugging loops. Furthermore, coordinating multiple agents can, in some cases, produce unexpected outputs, requiring additional debugging and testing to ensure stability.\n\nWhen processing larger datasets, multi-agent models\u2014particularly the Coding-Debating Hybrid and Debating-Coding Hybrid models\u2014consume a significant amount of tokens. Although the framework incorporates methods to reduce token consumption (such as limiting debate rounds), token usage remains a critical constraint for applications with limited resources.\n\nThe paper also has numerous issues in expression.
