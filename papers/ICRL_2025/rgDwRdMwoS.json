    "title": "A Unified Approach to Routing and Cascading for LLMs",
    "abstract": "The widespread applicability of large language models (LLMs) has increased the availability of many fine-tuned models of various sizes targeting specific tasks. Given a set of such specialized models, to maximize overall performance, it is important to figure out the optimal strategy for selecting the right model for a given user query. An effective strategy could drastically increase overall performance and even offer improvements over a single large monolithic model. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: routing, where a single model is selected for each query, and cascading, which runs a sequence of increasingly larger models until a satisfactory answer is obtained. However, both have notable limitations: routing commits to an initial model without flexibility, while cascading requires executing every model in sequence, which can be inefficient. Additionally, the conditions under which these strategies are provably optimal remain unclear. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for both routing and cascading. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel approach called *cascade routing*, which combines the adaptability of routing with the cost-efficiency of cascading. Our experiments demonstrate that cascade routing consistently outperforms both routing and cascading across a variety of settings, improving both output quality and lowering computational cost, thus offering a unified and efficient solution to the model selection problem.",

The theoretical framing allows for provable optimality under certain conditions.\n\n2. Experimental evaluations on RouterBench consistently demonstrate improved performance, yielding a 1-4% increase in AUC across various noise levels and model set sizes, for both routing and cascading tasks.\n\n3.

The paper acknowledges the limitations of current quality estimation methods. Could you elaborate on potential future directions for improving these estimations? Are there specific features or model architectures that you find promising? Additionally, how does the choice of quality metric, such as accuracy versus user preference, impact the performance of cascade routing?\n\n3. I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed error analysis of the results across different benchmarks. This analysis could offer insights into the types of queries where cascade routing excels or underperforms, guiding future improvements."

Their approach allows dynamic model selection and sequencing based on both query difficulty and model specialization.

The strength of this paper's approach lies in achieving higher accuracy at the same computational cost, though it comes at the expense of longer runtime. Given that the accuracy improvement ranges are only between 1% to 4%, the authors need to demonstrate that the additional runtime is sufficiently minimal to justify the practicality of this approach.\nSpecifically, the authors should clearly state the runtime of different methods in the experiments presented in Figure 2 and Table 2 and include the runtime and AUC for the three methods: Linear Interpolation, Routing, and Cascade (Baseline) in Table 3.\n \n3. The method proposed in this paper does not change the model order compared to the existing cascade approach, nor does it alter the methods for estimating cost and output quality.
