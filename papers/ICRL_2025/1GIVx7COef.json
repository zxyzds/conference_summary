    "abstract": "Recent point tracking methods have made great strides in recovering the trajectories of any point (especially key points) in long video sequences associated with large motions. \nHowever, the spatial and temporal granularity of point trajectories remains constrained by limited motion estimation accuracy and video frame rate. \nLeveraging the high temporal resolution motion sensitivity of event cameras, we introduce event data for the first time to recover spatially dense and temporally continuous trajectories of any point at any time. \nSpecifically, we define the dense and continuous point trajectory representation as estimating multiple control points of curves for each pixel and model the movement of sparse events triggered along continuous point trajectories. \nBuilding on this, we propose a novel multi-frame iterative streaming framework that first estimates local inter-frame motion representations from two consecutive frames and inter-frame events, then aggregates them into a global long-term motion representation to utilize input video and event data with an arbitrary number of frames. \nExtensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the significant improvement of our framework over state-of-the-art methods and the crucial role of introducing events for modeling continuous point trajectories.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a model for dense point tracking from a multimodal input consisting of RGB frames captured by a standard shutter camera and events coming from an event camera.\n\nIn order to represent the motion, the method proposes to parametrize point trajectories with B-Splines, predicting therefore the control points {P_i}_i=1...Nc to recover the curves {T_t}.\n\nTheir proposed \"local motion etimation\" model operates on pairs of adjacent frames I_t and I_{t+1} as well as the events happening between these adjacent frames E_{t->t+1}; and predicts local trajectories {T_{t->t+1}} between these adjacent frames. Then, these trajectories are sequentially combined to obtain {T_{1->t}}, a process which is sometimes aided by the current global motion representation M^{global} in case of occlusions (eq. 1). This global motion representation M^{global} is iteratively updated using the local motion representations M^{local} extracted by the \"local motion estimation\" module.\n\nThe model is trained on the synthetic MOVI-F dataset with 10k 7-frame videos during 500k steps, and evaluated on CVO-test and TAPVid-DAVIS. For the evaluation datasets, events are simulated using vid2e.\n\nQuantitative results show the proposed model can obtain SOTA performance on TAPVid-DAVIS and CVO point-tracking benchmarks, as well as in the DSEC optical flow leaderboard.\n\nThe authors also present ablation experiments for their global motion aggregation, curve representation and input data."

There are errors that show it was not carefully proofread, there are organization issues, and there are notation issues. For example, sec 3.1 speaks about the global motion representation without having introduced it. The notation in sec. 3.1 is also difficult to follow. For instance, it's not clear what the \"initial current global trajectory\" T^init_{1->t+1} means and how it is used, as it doesn't appear in any equation. There are also no details about that the Warp and Fusion operations in eq (1) are."

For instance, while the multi-frame aggregation is shown to improve performance, there is limited analysis of its specific contribution compared to simpler aggregation techniques.\n- The framework\u2019s computational cost, especially given the use of multi-frame input and dense tracking, could make it challenging for use in real-time applications, which is not fully addressed in the paper.\n- The EDCPT framework is computationally demanding, limiting its real-time applicability in scenarios where immediate results are required. Additionally, its reliance on event cameras restricts its use to specific hardware configurations, reducing its flexibility. While the proposed method is validated on benchmark datasets, further testing in a broader range of real-world applications would strengthen the claims of generalizability. Finally, the integration of event data introduces complexity in the framework, which may pose challenges in deployment and necessitate robust calibration and setup procedures for optimal performance."

For example, the paper mentions an occlusion handling strategy but lacks quantitative evidence of its effectiveness. Could the authors provide more information on how occlusions are managed and evaluated?"

Specifically, the approach of estimating local motion and then accumulating it is an old technique, commonly used in optical flow and dense tracking.\n\n- Another drawback is the lack of an inference time comparison, which is a common benchmark in prior protocols (e.g., in the FlowTrack paper). While comparing all methods on both synthetic and real datasets may be impractical, comparison with some representative studies is essential.\n\n- Since there\u2019s no dedicated event-based dense tracking dataset, the authors rely on synthetic datasets and evaluate event-based optical flow in real-world settings.
