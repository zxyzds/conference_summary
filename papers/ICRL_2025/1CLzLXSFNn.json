    "title": "TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis",
    "abstract": "Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce \\method, a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. TimeMixer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.",

The proposed model captures both short- and long-term dependencies by transforming time series data into multi-resolution images, enabling the analysis of complex temporal and frequency-domain patterns that challenge traditional models. The authors validate this with experimental results showing the new architecture outperforms SOTA models on most standard benchmarks. The ablation study helps validate the importance of the individual parts of the architecture \u2013 the channel mixing, image decomposition, and multi-scale and multi-resolution mixing. This approach continues to validate the benefits of integrating image analysis techniques with time series tasks.\n\nS2. The architecture is flexible for supporting different kinds of time-series tasks. The hierarchical multi-scale and multi-resolution mixing modules enable the model to flexibly adapt across various time series tasks, from forecasting to anomaly detection, promoting robust and accurate performance across applications.\n\nS3. Empirical Validation: the testing in this paper on eight benchmark time series tasks, including the hyperparameter ablation results, shows TIMEMIXER++ consistently surpasses both general-purpose and task-specific models, affirming its potential as a high-performance, general-purpose solution for time series analysis. The experiments were very thorough."

                "value": "Q1. The proposed architecture adds significant computational cost to the internal representation of the model compared to vanilla transformers and some of the previously proposed models. It seems this does not have a significant effect on the training time compute and memory complexity of the model. Have the authors conducted any studies to compare the inference-time cost of TM++ compared to other methods? \n\nQ2. As mentioned by authors, some time series tasks (imputation, anomaly detection) benefit more from diverse representations while others like forecasting and classification benefit from consistent representation. Given this, is there any way to leverage a routing model dependent on the proposed task type, which could lower the inference-time cost of this model?\n\nQ3. MTS-Mixer (Li et. al., 2023) presents another approach to channel decomposition which similarly outperformed competing models, but they found the approach worked best with MLPs rather than attention-based models. Have the authors explored this technique for separating from attention mechanisms which could lead to further efficiency and model performance?"

The theoretical understanding of the improvement as well as its time imaging and multi-resolution mixing is lacking, mostly based on intuition and simply blending the models. \n\nThere are some papers that already discussed the use of frequency analysis and the frequency components extraction for model deployment (e.g., [1][2][3]) to capture the periodic patterns, and they all claim it can capture the global interaction and patterns among time series, so what is the benefits of introducing multi-resolution time imaging, and it is worthwhile to compare them in ablation study? In addition, it is encouraged to cite the papers [1][2][3] if not yet in the references. \n\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] Koopa: Learning Non-stationary Time Series Dynamics with Koopman Predictors https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18803\n[2] TFDNet: Time-Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Network for Long-term Time Series Forecasting https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13386\n[3] FEDNET: FREQUENCY ENHANCED DECOMPOSED NETWORK FOR OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION TIME SERIES CLASSIFICATION https://openreview.net/forum?id=OVu9DsOjgH"
