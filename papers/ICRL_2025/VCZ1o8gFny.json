    "abstract": "The ever-expanding landscape of products, surfaces, policies, and regulations poses\nsignificant challenges for recommendation systems, leading to data fragmentation\nand prohibitive hikes in infrastructure costs. To address these challenges, we\npropose M3C, a holistic co-design of model, data and efficiency strategies. M3C\n(1) partitions the recommendation space to allow better representation learning\nand encourage knowledge sharing within a subspace; (2) covers each partition\nusing a hierarchy of foundational and vertical networks tailored to handle multi-\ndomain, multi-objective tasks with mixed-modal inputs; (3) forms a unified data\nrepresentation that utilizes heterogeneous signals across domains, objectives and\noptimization goals to alleviate data fragmentation, label sparsity, and to enhance\nknowledge sharing; (4) improves execution efficiency and lowers costs with a suite\nof stability and throughput optimizations. We show that across a diverse set of tasks\non public and industry datasets, M3C delivers up to 1% lower LogLoss compared\nto 10 state-of-the-art baselines, while improving system efficiency by up to 20%.\nFurthermore, in a large-scale industry setting our deployment of M3C has resulted\nin 7% top-line metrics improvement in online tests with 10% capacity savings.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a systematic framework for multi-domain, multi-objective, and multi-modal recommendation. The framework encompasses several key components, including domain-objective pair partitioning, external context storage, a Transformer and DWFB-based model architecture, a zipper and filter mechanism, and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. While the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of Logloss compared to the baseline Wukong model on an internal dataset, there are several areas that require further attention."

For instance, the domain-objective pairs partitioner and the mechanism for grouping these pairs are not clearly articulated. This omission makes it challenging to assess the flexibility of the proposed method and to understand how it balances commonalities and distinctions among pairs. The same problem applies to ECS. It is highly recommended that the authors provide detailed mathematical formulations or pseudo-code for this section.\n\n-\tThere seems to be an omission regarding the multi-domain setting. It would be helpful to know on which domains the proposed method learns and effectively transfers knowledge.\n\n-\tThe choice of baselines, except for Wukong, are somewhat outdated. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art multi-domain and multi-task baselines to position the proposed method.\n\n-\tConsidering that Wukong is utilized as component of the model, there seems trivial performance gap between the proposed method and Wukong in Table 1, even the proposed method is tuned by M3C Sketch. It deserves further ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component."

This work appears more appropriate for submission to the industrial track of a data mining conference such as SIGIR or KDD.\n2. The novel aspects of this framework primarily reside in the design of the Zipper, Filter, and Sketch modules. However, the explanations and illustrations regarding these components are sometimes unclear. I found it challenging to grasp certain details of the Zipper algorithm, such as the role of \"workers\" and the rationale behind extracting the set of features Fe. Figure 3 was also confusing to me. Similarly, understanding the pseudocode in Algorithm 1 was difficult. Furthermore, Section 3.3.2 glosses over many details of the M3R Sketch, while Appendix A2.2 remains difficult to comprehend and follow. The authors don\u2019t disclose plans to release the code and data, making it more difficult to understand the details and reproduce the model.\n3. A recent published work, \u201cM3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of Experts Recommendation Framework\u201d, shares quite similar theme and technical approach. While it is acknowledged in the related works, further detailed discussion and comparison appear necessary."
