    "title": "Learn hybrid prototypes for multivariate time series anomaly detection",
    "abstract": "In multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD), reconstruction-based models reconstruct testing series with learned knowledge of only normal series and identify anomalies with higher reconstruction errors. In practice, over-generalization often occurs with unexpectedly well reconstruction of anomalies. Although memory banks are employed by reconstruction-based models to fight against over-generalization, these models are only efficient to detect point anomalies since they learn normal prototypes from time points, leaving contextual anomalies and periodical anomalies to be discovered. To settle this problem, this paper propose a hybrid prototypes learning model for MTSAD based on reconstruction, named as H-PAD. First, normal prototypes are learned from different sizes of patches for time series to discover short-term anomalies. These prototypes in different sizes are integrated together to reconstruct query series so that any anomalies would be smoothed off and high reconstruction errors are produced. Furthermore, period prototypes are learned to discover periodical anomalies. One period prototype is memorized for one variable of query series. Finally, extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of H-PAD with state-of-the-art performance.",

The authors use several non-standard terms such as \u201cdifferent local sizes\u201d which should be corrected. \n2. The authors should provide additional implementation details on data processing and model training to help other researchers reproduce and extend their results. For example, how are the patch sizes {z1, z2, \u2026, zm} and k (as in top-k amplitudes of FFT) selected?\n3. The authors should discuss the limitations of their work and outline the directions for future research.\n4. There are numerous typos and grammatical errors that need to be proofread and corrected. For example, \u201creference phase\u201d should be \u201cinference phase\u201d (page 1) and \u201clearn and memory prototypes\u201d should be \u201clearn memory prototypes\u201d (page 2).\n5. The authors should provide rigorous mathematical definitions of affiliation precision/recall and RAP/RAR since they may not be familiar to most readers. The authors should also clearly explain why these metrics are used instead of the ordinary precision/recall/AUC.\n6. It\u2019d be helpful to have more detailed review of the mechanism of memory networks and memory prototypes (either in Related Work or in Supplementary Materials) since these concepts may not be very familiar to most readers.  \n7. In addition to real-world datasets, it\u2019d be ideal to evaluate the model on simulated time series data to verify that the patch and period prototypes indeed capture multi-scale and multi-period information and effectively detect the corresponding anomalies."

If we only look at Fig. 5, it seems that they are all point anomalies. It is recommended that the authors further add more types of anomalies to the visualization analysis to demonstrate the benefits of H-PAD."
