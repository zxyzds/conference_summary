    "abstract": "Radiation parameterization schemes are crucial components of weather and climate models, however, they are known to be computationally intensive. Alternatively, they can be emulated with machine learning (ML) regression models. Mainly vertical energy propagation motivates the usage of ML models featuring sequential data processing. We investigate these and related models for radiation parameterization using atmospheric data modeled within an Arctic region. We observe that NeuralODE performs best in predicting both the long- and short-wave heating rates. Furthermore, we substitute the architecture with its discrete form to boost its efficiency while preserving competitive performance. The practical applicability of the models was studied for different model sizes. Finally, We linked the trained neural network to the operational weather forecast model and assessed its performance versus the conventional radiation parametrization. We received a speedup of four times of the radiation steps without significant loss of accuracy. The proposed parametrization substitute can strongly reduce the computational burden and the carbon footprint of the weather forecasting.",

                "value": "This study presents the application of neural networks, particularly Neural ODEs, for surrogate radiation parameterization. It aims to reduce the runtime of radiation parameterization in numerical weather forecasting and enhance overall forecasting efficiency by leveraging the rapid inference capabilities of neural networks. To achieve this, the study approximates the heat transfer process using an ODE with an unknown right-hand side, which is estimated by a neural network. The experiments evaluated the practicality of 25 models across three types, integrating the machine learning model with the real WRF numerical model. Compared to traditional parameterization schemes, the module's runtime improved fourfold, while maintaining consistent prediction accuracy."

It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the specific advantages of Neural ODE in its application for this radiation parameterization task compared to other ML methods. Additionally, I encourage them to clarify how the parameterization substitution task differs from standard regression and ODE fitting tasks in terms of unique challenges or requirements. It might also be worth considering why well-known and high-performing architectures like neural operators and ResNet were not included as baselines in this study. I encourage the authors to explain their rationale for selecting the baseline models they used and to clarify whether they considered including these popular architectures.\n\n2. **Experimental Analysis**: The experimental analysis would benefit from further clarity and depth. Although the study evaluates 11 architectures across three categories and compares their accuracy, further exploration of the results is necessary for a complete understanding. I encourage the authors to provide a more detailed analysis of the performance differences between architectures, particularly for the RNN and Neural ODE models in shortwave and longwave predictions. Additionally, a discussion of potential reasons for these differences based on the characteristics of each architecture and the nature of the prediction tasks would greatly enhance the overall analysis.\n\n3. **Significance**: In the final WRF joint experiment, the choice to use a profile-wise convolutional RNN instead of Neural ODE raises an important question about the significance of the findings. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify their reasoning for selecting the RNN model for this experiment, particularly given that Neural ODE is discussed as a key focus of the paper. If the choice of RNN, is primarily to demonstrate that profile-wise machine learning parameterization schemes (like Neural ODE and RNN) are superior, this seems less novel, as prior work[1-3] has already established similar conclusions without framing them as profile-wise methods.\n\n[1] Wang, Jiali, Prasanna Balaprakash, and Rao Kotamarthi. \"Fast domain-aware neural network emulation of a planetary boundary layer parameterization in a numerical weather forecast model.\" _Geoscientific Model Development_ 12.10 (2019): 4261-4274. \n\n[2] Jakhar, Karan, et al. \"Learning closed\u2010form equations for subgrid\u2010scale closures from high\u2010fidelity data: Promises and challenges.\" _Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems_ 16.7 (2024): e2023MS003874. \n\n[3] Eyring, Veronika, et al. \"Pushing the frontiers in climate modelling and analysis with machine learning.\" _Nature Climate Change_ (2024): 1-13."

                "value": "1. The loss in accuracy relative to the gained speed up seems too high. Fig. 5 and 6 give a first indication of this. The emulated parametrization can differ significantly from the original one, which would render the speed up not useful.\n2. Robustness of the models is not assessed. If the proposed emulator is to be used in WRF, it need to be applicable under a wide variety of input combinations. However, this study only considers a very limited study region in high northern latitudes during only a small time period (2015-2016). Moreover, this limitation is not meaningfully discussed. As is, I suspect the parametrization would have significantly decreased skill in most real-world applications and could potentially even be catastrophically wrong (e.g. unphysical).\n3. There is limited technical novelty in the contribution which makes the work less interesting to the broad readership of ICLR. More specifically, all neural network architectures studied in this work have been previously used, the dataset has been introduced in a different study (Yavich et al. 2024), the concept of emulating radiative transfer has been widely studied and the empirical results are not ground breaking.\n4. Many figures could be improved: reduce white space on the sides, use consistent fonts and font sizes, think about what you want to convey with a figure and then think about how to make this message most easily accessible for the reader.\n5. Many abbreviations not introduced, e.g. SW, LW\n6. The tables are difficult to grasp and do not seem to have a clear message, but instead are conveying that many models have been compared and one of them turned out to be best in some cases. Also, what does bold face mean in the tables?\n7. Section 2 contains lengthy descriptions of different methods, however it remains unclear how they contribute to the overall story of the paper.\n8. While the study compares many baselines, it does not compare to any previously published emulators of radiative transfer schemes, which makes it difficult to assess how good the reported metrics are.\n9. While reporting RMSE is important, it would be good to also evaluate additional metrics, especially those that give an indication about absolute skill levels, e.g. R^2 or relative RMSE (normalized by variability of targets)."

However, since you only achieve a speed up at a loss in accuracy it would be important to understand this trade-off in detail. In other words, can you draw a pareto frontier showcasing the loss in accuracy vs. the gain in speed up of multiple models? Ideally with a metric that also allows to assess the accuracy of the original parametrization scheme in WRF?"

Radiative codes are one of the biggest bottlenecks in climate models. Often, radiative schemes reply on large lookup table which are hard coded into climate model fortran code. Even the most modern radiative transfer schemes do not take the full absorption band into consideration and at best rely on idealized absorption in a handful of discrete absorption bands.\n\nThe study uses a broad range of ML models, including CatBoost, Neural ODEs, CNNs, GRUs and their polynomial activation counterpart to (1) assess the performance of different architectures in emulating radiation, and (2) plug the best scheme into a regional climate model and assess speedups offered by an ML scheme as opposed to a traditional parameterization\n\nThe authors use observations in and over the Pechora Sea region for two years. One year is used for training and one year is used for testing.\n\nMore importatly, the architectures are chosen in a physics-inspired way and are categorized into three categories: point-wise (one level input used to prdict one level output), profile-wise (full vertical profile used to predict the full vertical profile) and sequential (using a sequential model like RNN to iterate and solve the radiative flux forcing at each vertical level starting from the boundaries).\n\nThe scheme with the least error is embedded into the WRF regional model and if found to provide a 4x speedup in model runtime. This testifies to the effectiveness/potential of ML models to improve traditional physical parameterizations."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The study appears to fall short on multiple fronts:\n\n1) Novelty: Apart from speedup in radiation emulation, the novelty of the work is not clear to me, since the central idea behind the work has been present by past papers and the paper pretty much uses established neural networks in their out-of-box configuration to emulate radiaton. Moreover, the authors have exhaustively used 19-20 different models of 10-11 different types. These models have not been explained in much detail (which is fine), and also the physical intuition behind simply using these many models is not clearly evident to me. If the focus is just Neural ODEs (as is the title of the submission), why not just compare it to one or two optimal baselines from past studies? I don't see any point in mixing it all up with 20 different types of models? This point is more so relevant as (to my understanding) the Neural ODE model wasn't even eventually coupled with WRF.\n\n2) Clarity: The paper is big on breadth but not on depth. Due to this, reading this paper was a bit of a struggle as the focus has been on introducing the different architectures, and not on why they would work and others would not. Such an interpretation is likewise lacking from the results and discussion section as well. This goes back to my first point that the focus on breadth than depth makes me wonder about the novelty of the work and how it adds value to being accepted at ICLR. Most strikingly, the authors finally choose RNN 64,3 to couple to WRF, but the errors for that model have not been discussed in Table 3.\n\n3) Lacking schematics: It would have been great if the authors would have provided detailed schematics of the main architectures used. for instance, I found figure 1 to be quite nice and I am sure I would not have been able to understand the distinction between the categories without it. For instance, what merits are obtained by choosing both ODEGRU and Liquid Neural networks, and is there solid evidence that polynomial networks might outperform relu activation based models? Or have they been used merely for intellectual curiosity?\n\nThis is nice work, but because I find the ML novelty lacking and because the ideas have already been proposed in past studies, in my opinion, the paper might better fit in a physical science journal which would allow the authors to focus on the scientific merits of their particulat analysis (which I believe may be plenty)."
