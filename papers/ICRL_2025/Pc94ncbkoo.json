    "title": "$A^2$-DP: Annotation-aware Data Pruning for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "As the size of datasets for training deep neural networks expands, data pruning has become an intriguing area of research due to its ability to achieve lossless performance with a reduced overall data volume. However, traditional data pruning usually demands complete dataset annotations, incurring high costs. To tackle this, we propose an innovative Annotation-Aware Data Pruning paradigm tailored for object detection, dubbed\nas $A^2$-DP, which aims to reduce the burdens of both annotation and storage. Our approach, consisting of two phases, integrates a hard sample mining module to extract crucial hidden objects, a class balance module to identify important objects in rare or challenging classes and a global similarity removal module that enhances the elimination of redundant information through object-level similarity assessments.\nExtensive experiments on 2D and 3D detection tasks validate the effectiveness of the $A^2$-DP, consistently achieving a minimum pruning rate of 20\\% across various datasets, showcasing the practical value and efficiency of our methods.",

                "value": "This paper introduces A2-DP, an Annotation-Aware Data Pruning paradigm for object detection, which aims to reduce the annotation and storage burdens associated with large datasets. A2-DP employs a two-phase framework that includes hard sample mining to extract critical hidden objects, a class balance module to identify important objects in rare or challenging classes, and a global similarity removal module to eliminate redundant information through object-level similarity assessments. The method has been extensively tested on 2D and 3D detection tasks, consistently achieving a minimum pruning rate of 20% across various datasets without compromising performance, demonstrating its practical value and efficiency."

This paper focuses on data efficiency for object detection, which is very important for current data-scarce computer vision tasks because the annotations and storage for object detection are both costly and burdensome. \n2. The proposed method seems to be effective under different pruning rate, and has been deomistreted on both 2D and 3D object detection benchmarks.\n3. To evaluate the similarity in object level is reasonable because the object detection model typically focuses more on objects instead of scenes."

Although the authors attempt to use the concepts of data pruning, the problem is an active learning problem. The only difference between them is that the portion of labeled samples in active learning is smaller than that in the proposed method. Therefore, there is no essence difference between them. Moreover, the problem statement in section 3.1 is also incomplete in describing the problem of this paper.\n2. Lack of novelty. The proposed method leverages the uncertainty and class-balanced weights are very common in the data selection for object detection.\n3. The presentation needs to be improved. It would be better to switch the order for Figure 2b and Figure 2a according to their reference in the main text. Some math definitions are also not well defined, e.g., the $O$, $o$, and $O_i$.\n4. As the paper states, the proportion of data is calculated based on the number of annotated boxes rather than images. The authors may provide specific descriptions of the procedure. The images usually contain different numbers of objects, how to give an exact 20% data according to the number of objects?"

Does it mean the redundancy data in COCO would have a negative impact on the model?"
