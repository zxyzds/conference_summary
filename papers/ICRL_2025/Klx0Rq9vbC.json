    "title": "Navigating Concept Drift and Temporal Shift: Distribution Shift Generalized Time-Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is crucial for time-series forecasting models to produce robust predictions under potential distribution shifts. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series, designing proper concept drift methods for time series data received comparatively less attention.\n\nMotivated by the need to mitigate potential concept drift issues in time-series forecasting, this work proposes a novel soft attention mechanism that effectively leverages and ensemble information from the horizon time series. Furthermore, recognizing that both concept drift and temporal shift could occur concurrently in time-series forecasting scenarios while an integrated solution remains missing, this paper introduces ShifTS, a model-agnostic framework seamlessly addressing both concept drift and temporal shift issues in time-series forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and consistently outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.",

The authors propose a model-agnostic framework called ShifTS, which integrates a soft attention mechanism (SAM) to handle concept drift and existing temporal shift mitigation techniques. The framework aims to enhance the generalization and forecasting accuracy of time-series models by addressing both types of distribution shifts simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShifTS outperforms existing methods across various datasets and models. However, the methods used to address concept drift lack sufficient persuasiveness, and the techniques for handling temporal shifts do not introduce significant innovation."

However, it is not clear why this equality holds. A detailed derivation or explanation of the probabilistic relationships involved would enhance the clarity and understanding of the formula.\n\n- Figure 2 is very difficult to understand. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed caption or a step-by-step explanation of the components and their interactions. Additionally, the term \"Agg\" appears in both Algorithm 1 and Figure 2 but is not defined or explained in the main text. Including a clear definition and explanation of \"Agg\" would improve the readability and coherence of the paper.\n\n- The soft attention mask  $M$ is introduced, but it is not clear how the attention mechanism is implemented. Meanwhile, it is mentioned that $M$ is independent of $\\mathbf{X}^L$ and $\\mathbf{Y}^L$ during testing. This raises the question of how $M$ can effectively address concept drift in test data. Please explain how $M$, which is independent of the lookback data, can still mitigate concept drift in the test data.\n\n- The paper aims to solve the problem of simultaneous temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting. It is important to explain how the model handles the joint changes in both marginal and conditional distributions. Specifically, it should be clarified what distribution remains invariant and how the model learns to adapt to these changes. Given that handling both types of drifts is challenging even in traditional classification tasks, a detailed explanation of why and how the proposed method is effective in the time-series context would strengthen the paper.\n- Besides performance metrics, additional evidence is needed to demonstrate how the soft attention mask \n$M$  specifically mitigates concept drift."

SAM leverages exogenous information from the horizon window to weigh and ensemble time series at multiple horizon time steps, enhancing the model's generalization ability.

It should be significantly condensed or moved to background/preliminaries, as currently, it merely applies the existing RevIN method.\n    3. It takes space that could be better used to explain novel contributions\n2. Practical feasibility concerns with exogenous feature forecasting:\n    1. The paper proposes forecasting X\u0302_SUR to support target series prediction\n    2. This assumes we can accurately forecast exogenous features, which may be as hard as the original problem. No clear justification for why forecasting exogenous features would be more reliable than direct target forecasting. The surrogate loss (equation 3) doesn't guarantee accurate exogenous forecasts.\n    3. The method likely works on the benchmark datasets primarily because X itself has limited concept drift in chosen long-term benchmarking datasets (Limited dataset diversity (ILI, Exchange, ETT share similar characteristics). Success may not generalize to scenarios with significant concept drift in exogenous features themselves. \n    4. Consider synthetic experiments with controlled concept drift in X.\n3. The performance gains of ShifTS over baseline methods lack convincing statistical validation:\n    1. Performance differences between ShifTS and baseline methods in Table 2 are inconsistent and often marginal (e.g., on ETTh1: ShifTS MSE 0.076 vs FOIL 0.081 vs RevIN 0.085, and on ETTh2: ShifTS 0.194 vs SAN 0.199 vs N-S Trans 0.203), with no statistical significance testing or variance reporting across seeds to validate these small improvements. \n    2. ShifTS's gains over strong baselines like SAN and FOIL appear dataset-dependent, and the margins are small enough to question statistical significance\u2014especially noticeable on Exchange, where temporal shift methods perform comparably (ShifTS 0.470 vs SAN 0.415) and ShifTS+SAN (0.407) perform better than ShifTS alone. \n    3. Without proper variance reporting across different model seeds, it's difficult to conclude if ShifTS truly outperforms existing methods or if the improvements (often 2-5% range) fall within standard deviation ranges of multiple training runs\n4. The choice of sparsity regularization in equation (2) needs better motivation\n5. The mutual information analysis (Figure 3a) could benefit from more rigorous statistical validation beyond the p-value.\n\nMinor comments\n1. While the approach is model-agnostic, all evaluations use transformer-based models. Testing with other architectures (e.g., RNNs) would strengthen the claims."
