    "title": "LDINet:  Latent Decomposition-Interpolation for Single Image Fast-moving Objects Deblatting",
    "abstract": "The image of fast-moving objects (FMOs) usually contains a blur stripe indicating the blurred object that is mixed with the background. To deblur the stripe and separate the object from the background in the single image, in this work we propose a novel Latent Decomposition-Interpolation Network (LDINet) to generate the appearances and shapes of the objects. In particular, under the assumption that motion blur is an accumulation of the appearance of the object over exposure time and the long blur can be decomposed into several shorter blur parts, the blurry input is first encoded into latent feature maps and then an efficient Decomposition-Interpolation Module (DIM) is introduced to break down the feature maps into discrete time indexed parts corresponding to different small blurs. And the target latent frames are further interpolated according to the provided time indexes with affine transformations, where the feature maps are categorized into the scalar-like and gradient-like parts to effectively capture the intrinsic properties of features warping in the interpolation. Finally, the sharp and clear images are rendered with a decoder. In addition, based on the generated images by LDINet, a Refining Conditional Deblatting (RCD) approach is presented to use post-image-to-image techniques to further enhance the fidelity of the textures and the accuracy of the masks. Extensive experiments are conducted and have shown that the proposed methods achieve superior performances compared to the existing competing methods.",

This work improves up on the previous attempt in the domain by changing the way the latent embedding is decoded into multiple sharp frames. To this end, authors propose to bring in the possibility to assume linear motion over small time interval and then modeling the changes from one part of the time frame to another using affine motion. Such additional constraints and regulations helps to recover better mask as well as sharp objects as highlighted through various examples."

Since such two parts can be readily integrated, more detailed support is expected for better understanding. \n\n3. The task of deblatting of FMOs is somewhat restricted. The problem setting of requiring the background image is not always practical, and complicated background environments are not tested.
