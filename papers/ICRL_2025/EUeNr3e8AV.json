    "title": "R2Det: Exploring Relaxed Rotation Equivariance in 2D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to capture equivariant features and explore underlying symmetries in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as symmetry breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly equivariant under limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotationa-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.",

The authors introduce a novel approach, Relaxed Rotation-Equivariance (RRE), which effectively addresses this limitation. The proposed R2Det model leverages RRE to achieve remarkable performance with a significantly reduced parameter count compared to other leading models. This showcases the model's efficiency and its ability to achieve high accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The paper further strengthens its arguments with a rigorous mathematical framework, providing theoretical underpinnings for RRE's effectiveness. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of the proposed ER2GConv layer allows for seamless integration into existing object detection models, making it a versatile and readily applicable technique. This combination of novelty, theoretical soundness, efficiency, and integration capabilities makes this research highly valuable for advancing the field of object detection.\nHowever, the paper lacks sufficient exploration of the key parameter b, which controls the perturbation factor \u0394. While the paper mentions that b=0.1 yields the best results, more extensive experiments with intermediate values of b would strengthen the argument for the necessity of this perturbation parameter and provide a deeper understanding of its influence on performance. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the performance of R2Det in larger configurations, such as \u201cR2Det-L\u201d, and compare its performance to the corresponding \u201cLarge\u201d versions of YOLO models. This would provide a more complete assessment of the model's scalability and potential limitations in handling more complex and computationally demanding tasks. The clarity and persuasiveness of the paper can be further enhanced by addressing these specific concerns, and by providing concise explanations for abbreviations like SO(2) (Special Orthogonal Group in 2D space) and ER2GCBA (Efficient Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Group Convolution plus -BA, where -BA likely refers to a specific architectural component or technique).\n\n* This work makes a valuable contribution to the field of object detection by addressing the limitations of traditional, strictly rotation-equivariant models and exploring the potential of RRE through ER2GConv.\n* The authors introduce a novel approach, Relaxed Rotation-Equivariance (RRE), which effectively addresses the limitation of handling real-world scenarios where strict rotational symmetries are rarely observed.\n* The proposed R2Det model leverages RRE to achieve remarkable performance with a significantly reduced parameter count compared to other leading models, showcasing the model's efficiency and ability to achieve high accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources.\n* The paper further strengthens its arguments with a rigorous mathematical framework, providing theoretical underpinnings for RRE's effectiveness.\n* The plug-and-play nature of the proposed ER2GConv layer allows for seamless integration into existing object detection models, making it a versatile and readily applicable technique."

                "value": "1. The provided background and naming of methods are misleading and partially incorrect. Indeed, **relaxed** equivariance is defined in (Kaba and Ravanbakhsh, 2023) as a relaxation that allows breaking the symmetry of inputs and mapping to arbitrary orbit types when necessary. Note that the output of the function is still predictable under the transformation of the input. While in R2Det, the relaxed equivariance is mistakenly defined (definition 1, line 161) using the definition of **$\\epsilon$-approximate** equivariance (despite referring to the definition from (Wang et al., 2022a) which correctly names it **$\\epsilon$-approximate** equivariance). \nFurthermore, the introduced filter is called a \"relaxed rotation-equivariant filter\" but is implemented by allowing for some learnable perturbation, which is therefore **NOT** a **relaxed** rotation-equivariance module. Figure 1a also incorrectly illustrates the problem being tackled in the paper. Notably, relaxed equivariance was introduced as an alternative to noise-injection methods: \"offering an alternative to the noise-injection methods\" (see the abstract from Kaba and Ravanbakhsh, 2023).\nThe above-mentioned problems make the paper's claims incorrect and could lead to important misunderstandings of already established concepts. \n2. The paper is not easy to read, mainly because of: the abundant use of abbreviations and acronyms (ENN, GConv, RRE, SRE, NRE, R2Filter, R2Lift, R2GConv, DR2GConv, PR2GConv, ER2GConv, ER2GCBA, ...), multiple typos  (\"Rotationa-Equivariant\" line 25, \"we further exploring\" line 62, \"More analysis can refer to\" line 167, \"converge when 66-epoch\" and  \"converges at about 198 in the epoch\" lines 401-402, ...) and over-loaded illustrations (e.g., Figure 2 and 3)."

The more detailed diagrams could then be moved to appendix.\n\nQuestions:\n- The performance gap between different $n$-norder cyclic rotation groups is substantial (Table 3). What is the reason for such a gap? Is it only due to the \"newer equivariant angles\"? How would the introduced architecture perform without equivariance? Also, is there an intuitive explanation for why it is beneficial for 2D object detection (with non-rotating bounding boxes, like on COCO) to use $C_8$ instead of $C_4$, despite the output (bounding boxes) only having symmetries in the $C_4$ group?\n- Experiments showed that on both PASCAL VOC and COCO, performance with strict equivariance is inferior to that with the approximate equivariance introduced in the paper. For intuition, could the authors provide specific (intuitive or experimental) examples of 2D object detection in which it is beneficial to break the strict rotation equivariance?\n\nI am willing to raise my rating if my concerns are addressed."
