    "title": "No Equations Needed: Learning System Dynamics Without Relying on Closed-Form ODEs",
    "abstract": "Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine learning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model\u2019s behavior becomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the behavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development, may allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug concentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero in the long term) and to design dosing guidelines (e.g., by looking at the peak concentration and its timing). Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation and then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use (in pharmacology and other domains) is currently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming, requiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the equation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not satisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to rectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and its behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling low-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step modeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then analyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic representation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior) directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This direct approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases into the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly, ensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only simplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and flexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of this method through extensive experiments, demonstrating its advantages in terms of both performance and practical usability.",

                "value": "This paper presents an approach to modeling the solutions (trajectories) of dynamical systems by bypassing the need to derive (discover) the closed-form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Instead of the conventional two-step approach (discovering an ODE and then analyzing it), the authors propose *direct semantic modeling*. \n\nThe promised contributions include:\n\n1. A shift from Syntactic to Semantic representations. The latter delivers a formal means to describing the behavior of trajectories and system dynamics. \n\n2. A direct Semantic Modeling framework, which essentially comprises a *trajectory predictor* that generates trajectories fitting the semantic description. This model alleviates the need for attaching a compact symbolic equation, and employs so-called \"motifs\" to describe trajectories, while remaining interpretable.\n\n3. Through a set of mostly 1D experiments, including a pharmacokinetic model, the authors demonstrate that the proposed semantic ODE offers improved performance, interpretability, and robustness to noise compared to traditional models like SINDy."

                "value": "The paper puts forth a scheme that moves away from the two-step modeling process of equation discovery and analysis, proposing instead that the semantic (behavioral) representation of a system can be derived directly from data, which in essence renders it closer to a solution discovery (as opposed to) equation discovery scheme. The concept of focusing on semantic rather than syntactic representation is original, as it allows modelers to interact with and interpret the behavior of systems without delving into complex symbolic mathematics. The originality here lies in both the reframing of the problem and the technical solution that bypasses the need for closed-form equations.\n\nThe paper demonstrates a clear and well presented theoretical development and practical implementation. Key symbols are defined in a notation table and important terms such as semantic representation, syntactic representation, and direct semantic modeling are well-defined, with illustrative examples and figures that clarify the difference between traditional ODE modeling and the proposed approach. The evaluation experiments are cover a range of dynamical systems (albeit low dimensional), including pharmacokinetic models, systems with delay differential equations, and integro-differential equations. The authors further validate the practical usability of Semantic ODE, with case studies and error analyses that underscore its flexibility, robustness, and potential for adaptation. \n\nThe potential significance of this paper is substantial. By removing the reliance on closed-form equations and focusing on the semantic representation of system behaviors, the proposed method has applications across multiple domains, where dynamical systems modeling is essential. Additionally, the demonstrated robustness to noise and the flexibility of Semantic ODE to adapt to various types of differential equations indicate that this method could be robust, at least for the type of low dimensional problems that are here treated."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the interesting idea, which draws some ties to a (flexible) curve fitting approach, certain weaknesses are identified as follows:\n\n1. **Limitations Due to Motif-Based Semantic Representation**: While the paper argues that semantic modeling offers flexibility over traditional ODE discovery methods, the reliance on a predefined set of motifs to construct semantic representations introduces notable constraints. The specific motifs used limit the types of trajectories that can be effectively modeled, potentially narrowing the applicability of the method to systems with well-defined, predictable patterns. This approach risks excluding complex or novel trajectory shapes that fall outside the pre-selected motif set, thereby introducing a form of inductive bias that contradicts the method\u2019s stated goal of flexibility.\n\n2. **Scalability and Extension to Higher Dimensions**: The current implementation focuses exclusively on one-dimensional systems, and while the authors mention potential future work on extending to higher-dimensional systems, they do not provide concrete strategies for achieving this. The direct semantic modeling approach, as presented, lacks a clear path for scaling motifs and trajectory predictions in multiple dimensions, which is crucial for broadening applicability in fields like biology, physics, and engineering where systems often involve multiple interacting variables.\n\n3. **Evaluation Against More Complex Baselines**: While the authors compare Semantic ODE to methods like SINDy, the experiments could be strengthened by benchmarking against more advanced and recent models in dynamical system solution discovery. Specifically, neural ODEs (e.g., Chen et al., 2018) and hybrid models that combine symbolic and neural approaches (like symbolic regression combined with neural networks) could serve as competitive baselines, as these methods have demonstrated flexibility and scalability, even in higher dimensions.  Do take note of the fact that such schemes as well, e.g. Neural ODEs, are linked to interpretability due to their ties to known dynamical system forms (e.g. state-state ODE formulation)\n\n4. **Conceptual Contribution**: At the end of the day, it is not so clear why using predefined motifs is really different to assumptions of classes of solutions (as SINDy does) that sever as a bases to define convexity or concavity (which is really what the motifs do). One should also keep in mind that equations discovery is not always a necessary step. It is, however, a very useful step for understanding the type of physics that is underlying the problem. How does the proposed scheme offer the same granularity of information?\n\n5. **Robustness to Unpredictable System Behaviors**: While the authors demonstrate that Semantic ODE is robust to noise, they do not address its performance in systems with unpredictable or highly chaotic behaviors. Since the semantic model relies on motif sequences, unpredictable behaviors could challenge the motif-based representation and disrupt accurate prediction or interpretation. Why not try this for example on nonlinear systems, such as the Duffing oscillator."

            "questions": {
                "value": "It would be helpful if the authors reply to the following questions, which are linked to the previously identified weaknesses.\n\n1. How flexible is the proposed motif-based representation in accommodating unforeseen trajectory shapes or behaviors? What kind of motifs would the authors suggest adding if new trajectory patterns arise that fall outside the current motif set?\n\n2. Extending to higher-dimensional systems appears non-trivial within the current approach. Do the authors have any specific strategies or theoretical insights on how they might define and handle multi-dimensional semantic representations and motifs?\n\n3. Why did the authors choose not to include comparisons with neural ODEs or hybrid methods that combine neural networks with symbolic regression, which have become prominent in modeling complex systems? Could these methods offer competitive advantages in interpretability or performance?\n\n4. Do the authors believe that the proposed scheme offers the same granularity of information as i) equation discovery scheme and ii) solution discovery schemes making use of specific analytical functions? If so, in what sense?\n\n4. Since the model relies on motifs for capturing trajectory shapes, how would it perform in the presence of chaotic or unpredictable system dynamics? Have the authors tested the model\u2019s performance on chaotic systems, and if so, what were the results?\nIf possible, testing on a few chaotic systems or adding a discussion on expected limitations in handling chaotic behaviors could clarify the approach\u2019s robustness and generalizability. If chaotic dynamics prove problematic, the authors could suggest potential modifications for better handling non-smooth or irregular trajectories.\n\n5. What specific adjustments or extensions do the authors envision to broaden the adoption of Semantic ODE? Are there plans for enhancing the method to accommodate periodic or oscillatory behaviors that cannot be fully captured within finite compositions?"

In the second representation, the authors introduce direct semantic modeling via predefined bounded, unbounded, and horizontal asymptote dynamic motifs. This data-driven method is demonstrated through a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation. A semantic predictor is trained via a classification-base composition predictor and a properties prediction via a set of univariate functions, and fed into a trajectory predictor, which outperforms the traditional two-step process of equation discovery and analysis in terms of prior knowledge injection, model editing, feedback mechanism, and noise resistance. The syntactic inductive bias due to the analytic and human-understandable nature of equations can be mitigated and the semantic inductive bias can be cured by editing the model."

The so-called direct semantic modeling approach allows more complexities beyond the analytical models and can integrate empirical knowledge via model editing. The definition of the problem and solution properties including the features of dynamic motifs are well formulated. Although the logic, workflow, and performance of the semantic predictor is demonstrated by using a one-dimensional model, the idea extends to higher dimensions."
