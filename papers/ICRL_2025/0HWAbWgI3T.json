    "title": "A Geometric Approach to Personalized Recommendation with Set-Theoretic Constraints Using Box Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Personalized item recommendation typically suffers from data sparsity, which is most often addressed by learning vector representations of users and items via low-rank matrix factorization. While this effectively densifies the matrix by assuming users and movies can be represented by linearly dependent latent features, it does not capture more complicated interactions. For example, vector representations struggle with set-theoretic relationships, such as negation and intersection, e.g. recommending a movie that is \u201ccomedy and action, but not romance\u201d. In this work, we formulate the problem of personalized item recommendation as matrix completion where rows are set-theoretically dependent. To capture this set-theoretic dependence we represent each user and attribute by a hyperrectangle or box (i.e. a Cartesian product of intervals). Box embeddings can intuitively be understood as trainable Venn diagrams, and thus not only inherently represent similarity (via the Jaccard index), but also naturally and faithfully support arbitrary set-theoretic relationships. Queries involving set-theoretic constraints can be efficiently computed directly on the embedding space by performing geometric operations on the representations. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of box embeddings over vector-based neural methods on both simple and complex item recommendation queries by up to 30% overall.",

                "value": "This paper proposes using box embeddings for matrix completion to improve personalized item recommendation with set-theoretic queries. Box embeddings are employed to bypass the limitation of commonly used vector embeddings, which might fail to recommend items for set-theoretic queries consisting of negotiation and intersection relationships. By representing users, items. and attributes as box embeddings, i.e., hyper rectangles in d-dimensional space, the proposed approach can jointly factorize user-item interaction matrix and item-attribute matrix. Then, users and attributes are regarded as boxes containing multiple items. As such, given a query containing set relationships between attributes, the model retrieves top items having the largest box volume shared with those of users as recommendation list. The whole model is trained to capture containing relationships, i.e., user and attribute boxes contain multiple item boxes. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed method."

The set nature of queries, which consists of set relationships such as negotiation and intersection, leads to an interesting research question: how to capture such relationships to make more accurate recommendations.\n\n2. The employment of box embeddings to represent users, items, and attributes is intuitive and sensible to capture set relationships between these three.\n\n3. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate good performance of the proposed box embedding method, outperforming vector embedding approaches.\n\n4. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow."

Despite showing promising recommendation results, the proposed method seems to be a direct application of box embeddings for personalized item recommendation with set theoretic queries, which is somehow a limited contribution.\n\n2. The paper relies heavily on the theory of box embeddings but some key concepts were not described sufficiently. For example, in line 191, how to guarantee $x^\\llcorner < x^\\urcorner$ for all dimensions $d$; what is the definition of $VolIntGB$ in Equation 3?; what are the parameters of the model to optimize?\n\n3. The baselines are somewhat limited. Although authors already mentioned in Section 2.1., representative baselines such as LightGCN [1] and MultiVAE [2] were not considered.

                "value": "### Questions\n  - (Q1) The authors used nDCG@K for model selection, but evaluated the final performance based on HR@K. Why did the authors use inconsistent metrics for validation and testing? In my opinion, HR@K with 100 negative items is a rather insensitive measure for ranking evaluation. I would like to recommend using Recall@K without negative sampling.\n  - (Q2) In the current manuscript, the authors do not mention/discuss the result on MovieLens-20M (Table 7 in Appendix B.3). Also, Table 7 is not self-contained. What is the definition of VEC-*? (probably MF or NeuMF?)\n \n### Comments.\n   - (C1) To my understanding, \"attribute-specific query recommendation\" is the task where (1) item attribute values are partially observed and often missing, and (2) in the prediction phase, the positive items are conditioned not only on a user but also on a boolean query. The problem of (1) has been addressed in existing studies (e.g., [b,c]). I am not familiar with (2) in the context of item recommendation, but there might be existing research on it.  A discussion/comparison of existing studies on these points would make it easier to understand the novelty of this work.\n   - (C2) In line 368, the authors report that they followed the standard sample scoring procedure described in Rendle et al. (2020). However, to my understanding, using this sampling technique is not recommended for a dataset with a small item catalog such as Last-FM, MovieLens-1M, NYC-R. It may just undermine the reliability of the reported results to reduce a small experimental cost.\n\n\n## References\n\n [b] Wu, Le, et al. \"Joint item recommendation and attribute inference: An adaptive graph convolutional network approach.\" Proceedings of the 43rd International ACM SIGIR conference on research and development in Information Retrieval. 2020.\n\n [c] Xian, Yikun, et al. \"Ex3: Explainable attribute-aware item-set recommendations.\" Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. 2021."
