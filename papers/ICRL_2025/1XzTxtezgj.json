    "title": "Intervention-based Causal Discrimination Discovery and Removal",
    "abstract": "Causal inference is a recent and widely adopted paradigm to deal with algorithmic discrimination. Building on Pearl's structure causal model, several causality-based fairness notions have been developed, which estimates the unfair causal effects from the sensitive attribute to the outcomes by incorporating the intervention or counterfactual operators. Among them, interventional fairness (i.e., $K$-Fair) stands out as the most fundamental and broadly applicable concept that is computable from observantional data. However, existing interventional fairness notions fail to accurately evaluate causal fairness, due to their following inherent limitations: (i) the causal effects evaluated by interventional fairness cannot be uniquely computed; (ii) the violation of interventional fairness being zero is not a sufficient condition for a causally fair model. To address these issues, we firstly propose a novel causality-based fairness notion called post-Intervention Cumulative Ratio Disparity (ICRD) to assess causal fairness of the decision models. Subsequently, we present a fairness framework (ICCFL) based on the proposed ICRD metric. ICCFL firstly generates interventional samples, and then computes the differentiable approximation of the ICRD to train a causally fair model. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ICRD effectively assesses causal fairness, and ICCFL can better balance accuracy and fairness.",

It follows previous work by Salimi et al (2019) and Ling et al (2023) on interventional fairness or K-fairness. An algorithm is K-fair if interventions on the sensitive attribute do not change the predictions, while also causally conditioning on a given context K. The current paper extends this definition by applying a 1-Wasserstein distance to the difference between the interventional distributions, with interventions on the sensitive attribute. The proposed training strategy is empirical risk minimization with a penalty term added using the aforementioned 1-W. distance. The paper includes a few basic theoretical results and experiments comparing the method with several alternate methods on several datasets."

For example, Example 1 used to discuss limitation 1 might be applied again after introducing ICRD to illustrate how ICRD applies here, such as, what are the possible contexts C in this example. On a related note, although the ICRD notion has clear advantages over the K-Fair notion, it is unclear whether these advantages alone justify adding ICRD to the already large number of causal fairness definitions. It would be helpful to discuss the benefits of ICRD as a causal fairness definition in general. \n\n2. The ICRD notion centers on disparity in the cumulative causal effects. This is not necessarily desirable for understanding discrimination, as we may be more interested in dissecting the causal effects associated with specific scenarios. It would be helpful to discuss potential insufficiencies of the ICRD notion, for example, when ICRD may not be identifiable, when enforcing ICRD to be 0 may be too restrictive for fairness."

Can the ICCFL method be compared with any benchmark methods using other causal fairness notions, such as, path-specific fairness? This might reveal interesting observations on the comparison between ICRD and other non-intervention based causal fairness measures."

The insufficiency aspect could benefit from greater elaboration.\n- Lines 313\u2013314 state that \u201cICRD encompasses K-Fair and represents the cumulative causal effect of K-Fair across all decision thresholds,\u201d but this claim is difficult to interpret without additional clarification. Similarly, it is unclear how Table 1 was generated or how the decision threshold impacts outcomes. Could the authors further clarify these aspects?\n- Finally, I am unconvinced that the decision threshold\u2019s impact constitutes a limitation of K-Fair. K-Fair requires two distributions to be equivalent; hence, it is unclear how the decision threshold would influence this requirement.
