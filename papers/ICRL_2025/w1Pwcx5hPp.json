    "title": "Geometrically Constrained Gaussian Splatting SLAM",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique in SLAM due to its rapid and high-quality rendering capabilities. However, its reliance on discrete Gaussian ellipsoid primitives limits its effectiveness in capturing essential geometric features crucial for accurate pose estimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel dense RGB-D SLAM system that integrates an implicit Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) hash grid to constrain the distribution of Gaussian ellipsoids. This innovative approach enables precise estimation of the scene's geometric structure by smoothing the discrete Gaussian ellipsoids and anchoring them to the scene's surface. Acting as a low-pass filter, the implicit TSDF hash grid mitigates the inductive biases inherent in traditional 3DGS methods while preserving rendering quality. Our geometrically constrained map also significantly enhances generalization capabilities for depth estimation in novel views. Extensive experiments on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art tracking and mapping accuracy at speeds up to 30 times faster than existing 3DGS-based systems.",

                "value": "The authors introduce a novel SLAM approach that leverages a hybrid 3D representation by integrating an implicit, multi-resolution TSDF hash grid with explicit Gaussian primitives. This combination enriches the traditional Gaussian-based SLAM pipeline by enhancing mapping performance, which, in turn, improves pose accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in advancing SLAM performance."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The authors lack a deep understanding of basic concepts such as Gaussian representations, mapping, and localization, which results in superficial and imprecise descriptions throughout the manuscript, particularly in the Introduction. This lack of rigor affects the overall clarity and logical flow of the paper.\n\n1. The authors consistently use the term \u201cGaussian ellipsoid\u201d throughout the manuscript, which lacks rigor and accuracy. A Gaussian function represents a probabilistic distribution, characterizing the influence or effectiveness of a primitive within its surrounding region through a soft representation anchored at the primitive center. Using the term \"ellipsoid\" to describe a Gaussian primitive is misleading and stems from a simplification of Gaussian visualizations. I recommend revising this terminology to more precisely reflect the Gaussian function's role in soft spatial representation, rather than suggesting a fixed, ellipsoidal form.\n2. In lines 37\u201339, the authors suggest that Gaussian Splatting (GS) is suboptimal for representing 3D geometric structures, an assertion that is intuitively understandable. However, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer explanation of how this limitation affects pose estimation. Specifically, the impact of GS on pose accuracy seems more indirect compared to its effect on mapping. I recommend that the authors conduct an in-depth analysis, supported by experiments, to examine how the hybrid map representation directly enhances mapping accuracy and, by extension, indirectly improves localization performance. A comparison of mapping and localization outcomes with and without the hybrid representation would offer valuable insights.\n3. The authors currently assess mapping performance using depth error alone, which provides only a limited perspective on mapping improvements. Given the hybrid 3D representation proposed in this work, depth error alone does not sufficiently capture the contribution of the TSDF representation to mapping accuracy. A more comprehensive evaluation metric, such as mesh accuracy or 3D reconstruction quality, would more effectively demonstrate the mapping enhancements introduced by the TSDF component. Including these metrics would provide a clearer validation of the hybrid approach\u2019s impact on spatial fidelity and mapping robustness. \n4. In lines 46\u201347, using submaps is one approach to address the large number of Gaussian splats, but not the only one; the statement should be revised for accuracy.\n5. The ablation study should include mapping performance and present additional 3D visualizations to better illustrate the effects of the proposed method.\n6. The manuscript lacks the visualization for the proposed TSDF representation."

                "value": "1. It would be valuable for the authors to discuss how the proposed method compares to existing works that transfer 3D Gaussian representations directly into mesh or other representations better suited to capturing surface characteristics. Many state-of-the-art approaches (such as SuGaR) can transform Gaussian splats into mesh or similarly structured representations, which often enhances geometric detail and surface fidelity. The manuscript would benefit from clarifying the unique advantages or improvements this hybrid representation offers compared to these transformation-based approaches. Specifically, it would be helpful to see a comparison in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, or other aspects that highlight this method\u2019s distinct contributions.\n2. In Figure 1, why is it difficult to ascertain the correctness or improvement in the Gaussian representation within the highlighted red box regions, as the ellipsoid visualizations appear similar between the baseline and the proposed method? Additionally, what accounts for the significant black hole in the GSSLAM representation in the second example?"

Point-based representations, for example, allow flexible, on-demand resource allocation without the need for predefined scene boundaries or resolutions. However, introducing a neural field can reduce this flexibility.\n- Despite these limitations in novelty, the method offers only a marginal insight\u2014namely, that smoothed geometry provides better initialization of Gaussian locations.

However, this approach feels somewhat incremental, given that TSDF has already been employed in NeRF-based SLAM. It would be valuable to include an analysis comparing the advantages of this method against modified 3DGS techniques [1].\n\n2) A notable limitation of 3DGS-based SLAM methods is the efficient detection of loop closures, which remains unaddressed in this paper. While the paper emphasizes improvements in tracking, it does not provide visual results demonstrating loop closure. Although I do not expect this method to surpass established techniques such as photo-SLAM or other traditional SLAM-based modules, omitting loop closure limits the scope of innovation and reduces the paper's overall impact.\n\n3) Regarding Figures 4 and 6, it would be beneficial to include emphasized or highlighted areas, as shown in Figure 1. The current figures do not demonstrate advantages in rendering quality or geometric accuracy over other 3DGS-based methods.\n\n[1] Lu, Tao, et al. \"Scaffold-gs: Structured 3d Gaussians for view-adaptive rendering.\" CVPR. 2024."
