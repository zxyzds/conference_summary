    "title": "A Trajectory Probability Network for City-Scale Road Volume Prediction",
    "abstract": "City-scale road volume prediction is a fundamental task in traffic management. However, the observation data are often incomplete and biased, posting a challenge for accurate prediction. Existing methods address this issue through interpolation techniques or manual priors, but they typically provide only a deterministic restoration, overlooking the influence of other potential scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based probabilistic model, the Trajectory Probability Network (TraPNet), which predicts traffic volume through the aggregation of the joint distribution of potential trajectories. TraPNet makes full use of current observations, historical data, and road network information to offer a comprehensive inference of road volumes. Unlike autoregressive methods, TraPNet makes predictions in a single step, substantially reducing computational time while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experiments on real-world road networks demonstrate that TraPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and can keep the advantage with only 20\\% observation ratio. The code will be made publicly available.",

Reducing this duplication could improve readability.\n2. The  descriptions of trajectory interpolation/generation and traffic volume prediction are somewhat unclear. When the authors talk about predicting in a single step, they seem to be talking about autoregressive trajectory generation, while the task they focus on is traffic volume prediction.\n3. Following 2, the relevance of the baselines, Cam-Traj-Rec and Traj2Traj, to the traffic volume prediction task is unclear, as these primarily address trajectory interpolation/generation. In addition, when considering trajectory generation, more advanced baselines need to be compared, e.g., MobilityGPT[1], and TS-TrajGen[2], which also show similar trajectory maps like Figure 5 in the paper.\n4. The experimental dataset is insufficient. The data on Boston are all generated shortest path data, which may not fully capture real-world conditions. Given TraPNet\u2019s use of cross-attention in the node dimension, I am concerned about the performance and efficiency of the model on larger road networks (10k, or 100k+ nodes).\n\n[1] Haydari, Ammar, et al. \"Mobilitygpt: Enhanced human mobility modeling with a gpt model.\"\n[2] Jiang, Wenjun, et al. \"Continuous trajectory generation based on two-stage GAN.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence."

In Section 3.2, it is also unclear whether T for Y represents past or future time steps. Additionally, the baselines address trajectory recovery, while the related works in Section 2.1 focus on future prediction.\n\nW2: The descriptions of deep learning methods and checkpoint-based methods are confusing. Checkpoint-based methods appear to be a subset of deep learning methods, with the main difference from existing works lying in the data collection approach. However, it is unclear why checkpoint-based methods are considered \u201cmore applicable to real-world scenarios.\u201d\n\nW3: The trajectory representation may involve a high level of repetition. For example, repeating node 2 four times to indicate that the car spends four time steps on (2, 3) could result in substantial computational overhead and memory usage.\n\nW4: Only MAE is reported as a performance metric. Additional metrics like RMSE and MAPE would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\nW5: The transition from Equation 6 to Equation 7 in the loss function is not clearly explained, especially regarding how the simplification occurs.\n\nW6: The ablation study shows that using multi-head attention (8) yields an MAE of 0.538, significantly outperforming multi-query attention with an MAE of 0.667. Similarly, configuration (6) with the BVLC embedding shape achieves an MAE of 0.451, notably better than the default setting (0.667), contradicting the paper\u2019s claim that the default setting \u201chas little effect on performance.\u201d"

The framing of the problem\u2014traffic volume prediction\u2014appears very similar to traffic flow prediction, which is a prominent topic in spatiotemporal data mining and intelligent transportation systems. Given this context, it seems unusual that the proposed method is not compared with any of the numerous existing traffic flow prediction methods.\n2. The presentation of challenges could be improved. The paper states that \"the majority of these methods provide only deterministic reconstructions of missing data, overlooking inherent uncertainty in other potential scenarios.\" The term \"inherent uncertainty\" is somewhat vague and lacks further elaboration. Additionally, since MAE is used as the main evaluation metric in experiments, the probabilistic prediction capability of the proposed method isn't thoroughly assessed. This raises questions about whether the method can truly account for uncertainty in traffic comprehensively.\n3. Another challenge mentioned is that \"in some underdeveloped areas, observational data can be extremely sparse.\" However, it remains unclear how this challenge is addressed by the proposed method.\n4. It seems that predicting future traffic volumes requires first simulating each vehicle's appearance probability in the city, raising concerns about computational efficiency\u2014an aspect not assessed in experiments.\n5. Some implementation details are missing. For instance, the calculation of adjacency tables $A$ is not clearly defined, leaving ambiguity regarding how \"the other adjacency tables\" are calculated and aligned with $A_0$."
