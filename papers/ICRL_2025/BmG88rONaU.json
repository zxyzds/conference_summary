    "title": "Test-time Adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval with Query Shift",
    "abstract": "The success of most existing cross-modal retrieval methods heavily relies on the assumption that the given queries follow the same distribution of the source domain. \nHowever, such an assumption is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity and diversity of queries, thus leading to the query shift problem.\nSpecifically, query shift refers to the online query stream originating from the domain that follows a different distribution with the source one.\nIn this paper, we observe that query shift would not only diminish the uniformity (namely, within-modality scatter) of the query modality but also amplify the gap between query and gallery modalities. \nBased on the observations, we propose a novel method dubbed Test-time adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval (TCR). \nIn brief, TCR employs a novel module to refine the query predictions (namely, retrieval results of the query) and a joint objective to prevent query shift from disturbing the common space, thus achieving online adaptation for the cross-modal retrieval models with query shift.\nExpensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TCR against query shift. \nThe code will be released upon acceptance.",

                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of cross-modal retrieval in scenarios where the query data distribution deviates from the source domain, a phenomenon known as \"query shift.\" This deviation often leads to a performance decline in cross-modal retrieval systems. The authors propose a novel approach called TCR: Test-time adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval, which adapts cross-modal retrieval models during inference to account for query shift. The proposed method includes a query prediction refinement module and a joint objective function to prevent the disturbances caused by the query shift, enhancing the uniformity within the query modality and minimizing the gap between query and gallery modalities. The model is designed to operate effectively in real time by adapting to changing online queries. The approach was tested on six popular image-text datasets and demonstrated superior performance against existing test-time adaptation (TTA) techniques."

The method's unique combination of query prediction refinement and multiple loss functions sets it apart from traditional TTA approaches.\n2) The authors conducted extensive experiments across six datasets and compared their method against several state-of-the-art TTA models. The amount of experiments is fair and convincing. \n3) The paper proposes a joint objective consisting of three loss functions\u2014uniformity learning, gap minimization, and noise-robust adaptation\u2014that each address specific challenges introduced by query shift. This is a novel design for this problem."

                "value": "1)  The authors provide only limited discussion regarding the sensitivity of the various hyperparameters involved, such as the temperature and trade-off parameters. A more detailed analysis would improve understanding of the model's adaptability to different scenarios.\n2) The approach heavily relies on pre-trained models and assumes the existence of a well-aligned common space. In cases where the source domain model lacks robust representations, the effectiveness of TCR may be diminished. This could limit the generalizability of the approach to pre-trained models of different quality. More discussions and insights need to be given in order to make the paper more readable."

                "value": "1) The proposed TCR method aims to enhance retrieval robustness under query shift by manipulating modality uniformity and the modality gap. Given the variety of potential shifts in real-world data (e.g., subtle cultural variations, extreme distortions, rare domain-specific content), how does TCR perform across these different types of shifts? \n\n2) Could the model's performance degrade if it encounters shifts it was not explicitly evaluated against? A thorough breakdown of the model\u2019s robustness to a diverse set of query shifts would strengthen the understanding of its general applicability.\n\n3) This paper introduces several hyperparameters, such as the temperature parameter (\u03c4) for controlling the trade-off between smoothness and sharpness, and others for balancing the different loss terms. How sensitive is TCR to these hyperparameters, and how easy is it to tune them for new domains? Some more results from these ablations studies will be very beneficial."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. This research setting is limited by the assumption that each query batch contains i.i.d. samples. However, in real scenarios, query shift may occur unpredictably, introducing non-i.i.d. data within the same batch. This raises concerns about the method\u2019s applicability under such conditions.\n2. Regarding the emergence of query shift, I am curious whether temporal issues, such as temporal shifts or concept drift discussed in [1-3], are present in real-world scenarios. Could the authors provide relevant discussion on this aspect?   \n    [1] Evolving standardization for continual domain generalization over temporal drift.\u00a0*NIPS 2023*.\n    [2] Temporal domain generalization with drift-aware dynamic neural networks.\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.10664*\u00a0(2022)\n    [3]Online Boosting Adaptive Learning under Concept Drift for Multistream Classification, AAAI 2024\n3. In Section 3.2.1 on candidate selection, it would be valuable to address two points: first, whether gallery shift affects the outcomes of nearest neighbor selection; and second, how the number of selected candidates impacts the results. Additional experiments should be conducted to clarify these aspects.\n4. In Section 3.2.2, given the shift between the source and target domains, it is unclear why source-domain-like data can be directly selected based on centers. Could the authors provide further analysis and explanation on this approach?\n5. In section 3.5the definition of S(x_{i}^Q) in Equation (11) lacks corresponding theoretical analysis.\n6. In the experiments, the authors employed various methods to generate image or text query shifts. I believe the results may depend on the specific shift generation techniques used. Therefore, it is crucial to provide access to the data processing methods and code to ensure the reproducibility of the experimental results.\n7. I recommend that the authors discuss the limitations of the proposed method and outline specific future research directions. This would provide readers with additional insights and considerations for further exploration."
