    "abstract": "Current _volumetric_ biomedical foundation models struggle to generalize as public 3D datasets are small and do not cover the broad diversity of medical procedures, conditions, anatomical regions, and imaging protocols. We address this by creating a representation learning method that instead anticipates strong domain shifts at training time itself. We first propose a data engine that synthesizes highly variable training samples that enable generalization to new biomedical contexts. To then train a single 3D network for any voxel-level task, we develop a contrastive learning method that pretrains the network to be stable against nuisance imaging variation simulated by the data engine, a key inductive bias for generalization. This network's features can be used as robust representations of input images for downstream tasks and its weights provide a strong, dataset-agnostic initialization for finetuning on new datasets. As a result, we set new standards across _both_ multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation, a first for any 3D biomedical vision model, all without (pre-)training on any existing dataset of real images. Our code is attached.",

The method is based on generating realistic and varying synthetic data and training a generalist 3D segmentation and registration models on this data. The goal is to develop a method for generalizing to different imaging devices, medical procedures and conditions as well as different populations. \n\nThe data synthesis engine is capable to generate highly diverse samples and uses the totalsegmentattor dataset for shape templates. The \u201cfoundational\u201d model is then pretrained using contrastive pretraining and finetuned in multi-modality registration and few-shot segmentation. \n\nIn experiments the authors demonstrate excellent performance in both downstream tasks."

The data generation method consists of drawing samples from a semantically labelled repository of biomedical shape templates to randomly populate an empty 3D volume. The volume is then deformed. Empty space and organ 'envelopes' are also simulated. To simulate different modalities and protocols, random intensity transformation is applied to the deformed 3D volume to yield 2 images. Typical imaging artifacts such a sbias field and blurring are simulated through random augmentations.The two images are fed into a UNet, and contrastive pre-training is performed on features at each decoder layer. An anchor point is chosen in one of the images, and all voxels of that label in both images are considered positive, and everything else negative pairs. The network yields features that can be used to finetune on other modalities and tasks. Importantly, the representations are modality-agnostic and anatomy-agnostic."

Hoffmann et al.) and SynthSeg (GMM-like pixel value model for repainting brain structures. Billot et al.) Despite leveraging more anatomical shapes beyond brain structures and applied to a contrastive framework, the essence remains unchanged.  \n\nMany medical decisions are made not only on shape but also on subtle textures, for example, differentiating subtypes of tumors/lesions \u2013 toward which the proposed over-simplified appearance model by nature falls short. More sophisticated texture models need to be carefully studied beyond this manuscript.\n\nFor the same reason, high-level global semantic information such as relative locations between anatomical structures cannot be learned due to the nature of this approach. \n\nReal-world value: Given the increasing number of large-scale publicly accessible volumetric image datasets such as CT-RATE (Hamamci et al.), Totalsegmenter (Wasserthal et al.), and AbdomenAtlas (Li et al.), and the derived 3D foundation models, the real-world application of the proposed framework is unclear. Some of these large-scale public datasets come with fine-grain pixel-wise labels and associated radiological reports which provide additional supervision signals and text alignment potentials. The claimed generalization capability can be learned from multi-site large real-world datasets as well, through the intrinsic heterogeneity of big data and possibly through intense data augmentation."
