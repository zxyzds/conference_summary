    "title": "InstructRAG: Instructing Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Self-Synthesized Rationales",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential to enhance the accuracy and factuality of language models (LMs). However, imperfect retrievers or noisy corpora can introduce misleading or even erroneous information to the retrieved contents, posing a significant challenge to the generation quality. Existing RAG methods typically address this challenge by directly predicting final answers despite potentially noisy inputs, resulting in an implicit denoising process that is difficult to interpret and verify. On the other hand, the acquisition of explicit denoising supervision is often costly, involving significant human efforts. In this work, we propose InstructRAG, where LMs explicitly learn the denoising process through self-synthesized rationales --- First, we instruct the LM to explain how the ground-truth answer is derived from retrieved documents. Then, these rationales can be used either as demonstrations for in-context learning of explicit denoising or as supervised fine-tuning data to train the model. Compared to standard RAG approaches, InstructRAG requires no additional supervision, allows for easier verification of the predicted answers, and effectively improves generation accuracy. Experiments show InstructRAG consistently outperforms existing RAG methods in both training-free and trainable scenarios, achieving a relative improvement of 8.3% over the best baseline method on average across five knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Extensive analysis indicates that InstructRAG scales well with increased numbers of retrieved documents and consistently exhibits robust denoising ability even in out-of-domain datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability.",

Unlike traditional RAG methods that implicitly handle noisy inputs, INSTRUCTRAG leverages the instruction-following capabilities of LMs to generate synthetic rationales explaining how the correct answer is derived from the retrieved documents. These synthetic rationales serve as explicit denoising supervision, which can be used for in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning. This method not only improves the quality of in-domain RAG tasks but also enhances out-of-domain generalization. Finally, the paper demonstrates that by utilizing self-synthesized rationales, INSTRUCTRAG effectively addresses the challenges posed by noisy retrievals, making it a promising advancement in the field of RAG."

However, the extent and nature of this noise are not adequately discussed. A quantitative measurement of the noise and its impact on the model\u2019s performance would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the proposed method. Analyzing and quantifying the noise would also help clarify how much of the model\u2019s learning is genuinely informative versus potentially spurious.\n\n2. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the extracted knowledge, including illustrative examples and rationales. Conducting a human study to evaluate whether the extracted knowledge aligns with useful, meaningful content (or if it simply reinforces dataset biases) would add a layer of rigor. This evaluation could help establish whether the proposed method provides actionable insights or merely reflects the underlying biases in the dataset. \n\n3. The proposed method\u2019s restriction on accessing additional information sources (GPTs), relying primarily on self-regularization, may limit its practical utility in real-world applications where additional context and supervision are often available. Furthermore, the filtering and re-ranking mechanisms can be viewed as forms of self-regularization, and evaluating the effects of incorporating or comparing these elements would provide a more balanced assessment. Testing the method with and without these components could illustrate its practical utility in more realistic scenarios.\n\n4. The paper\u2019s approach, which employs instruction tuning, in-context learning, and knowledge extraction, aligns closely with established methodologies in related fields. As a result, the method may lack significant novelty, as it primarily adapts a classical pipeline to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) domain. Introducing new techniques or unique modifications tailored to RAG-specific challenges could significantly enhance the paper\u2019s contribution to the field.\n\n5. The paper would be strengthened by testing the proposed rationale learner across various models to assess its robustness. Demonstrating consistent performance improvements with different model architectures would reinforce the generalizability of the method and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness."

If the complete answer to a question is distributed across multiple documents, with each document containing only part of the answer, this approach might mistakenly filter out these useful documents, leading to hallucinations or an inability to correctly answer the question.

The authors conducted experiments using only LLaMA-3-Instruct as the backbone, with the quality of self-synthesized rationales largely influenced by the underlying model's capability. Low-quality rationales may impair model performance, suggesting that the success of this approach could be attributed to LLaMA-3-Instruct's strong capabilities.

Although the datasets used in this paper include a variety of question-answering formats, such as short-form, multi-hop, and long-form, they are all based on wiki-style content. To more convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness, the authors should further extend their evaluation to more realistic and domain-diverse RAG datasets, like FreshQA and BRIGHT. Could the author also discuss the potential challenges in applying their method to these datasets and propose specific experiments to show the performance?\n4.

Why do the authors adopt different retrievers for different datasets? What are the performance differences of the retrievers, such as Contriever, DPR, GTR, and BM25?

The approach is well-founded, as noise problems are prevalent in real-world RAG scenarios. InstructionRAG effectively addresses this problem.\n2. The design is sound. The first phase generates rationales, which mitigate potential noise issues. Furthermore, the authors note, \"The consistency ratio on training samples with at least one relevant document containing the ground-truth answer is 98% on average across five benchmarks, supporting the reliability of synthetic rationales as a sanity check.\" This aspect is crucial to the method's success.\n3. The experiments are comprehensive, with validation across five datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstructionRAG.\n\nHowever, one might question whether using such sampling methods to address noise issues is worthwhile. This approach incurs additional time costs, which I believe cannot be overlooked. Exploring whether enhancing retrieval models might more effectively resolve this problem is a worthwhile consideration.\n\nOverall, I am quite satisfied with the InstructionRAG method, which represents an influential contribution to the RAG field."
