    "title": "The Geometry of Phase Transitions in Diffusion Models: Tubular Neighbourhoods and Singularities",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models undergo phase transitions during the generative process where data features suddenly emerge in the final stages. The current study aims to elucidate this critical phenomenon from the geometrical perspective. We employ the concept of ``injectivity radius'', a quantity that characterises the structure of the data manifold. Through theoretical and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that phase transitions in the generative process of diffusion models are closely related to the injectivity radius. Our findings offer a novel perspective on phase transitions in diffusion models, with potential implications for improving performance and sampling efficiency.",

                "value": "There are a few of flaws in the paper's reasoning in my opinion.\n1. The paper doesn't define what a phase transition actually means or propose hypothesis on mechanism behind it. In particular, what makes the tubular neighborhood special among all neighborhoods? The message delivered by what is currently written is rather \"trajectories will eventually enter the tubular neighborhood\" and \"some kind of phase transition occurs when trajectories get closer to the data manifold\". However the same can also be said about neighborhoods of different radii. It would be helpful if there could be an argument supporting that transition starts once points enter the tubular neighborhood, or once they are sufficiently close by another unknown standard. For example, in Figure 5, it is not obvious whether the transition points match between the red and blue curves. \n2. The paper uses an oversimplified setting of a single injective radius for all points in the manifold. However, because: (i) the validity of manifold hypothesis in full generality is questionable see e.g. \"Verifying the union of manifolds hypothesis for image data\" (Brown et. al ICLR 2023) and intrinsic dimensions may vary among data points, (2) even assuming the manifold hypothesis, in practice the manifold is usually very wiggly, resulting in high variance in both R_1(M) and R_2(M). What \"entering the tubular neighborhood\" means might become ambiguous in such a setting. \n3. The experiments uses a simple setting of unit spheres with an intrinsic radius of 1. This setting is not very helpful because the intrinsic radius is critically determined at the origin, while in the actual diffusion model experiment, the majority (or at least a large percentage) of points approach the sphere from the outside, they don't really \"see\" the injective radius in the whole process. The emphasis on the injective radius in this case merits more explanation. Similar problem exists in the experiments on ellipses or tori. For instance, for ellipses, the injective radius is determined by the length of the short axis and the principal curvature at the end of long axis, and again the majority of trajectories will approach the manifold without out seeing these factors at all. For the experiments with MNIST and FMNIST, I think the method of embedding them into S^d  ignores their own intrinsic geometries and is inadequate, precisely by the authors's own analysis at the beginning of Section 5.4. Namely the datasets's intrinsic geometry is what matters here, a spherical embedding doesn't change the property that the intrinsic radius is small (and varying drastically among data points). Embedding it into S^d and pretending to have a fake injective radius of 1 completely disconnects the analysis from the reality for actual diffusion processes near the data distribution."

R_1(M) should be closely related to the reciprocal of the largest principal curvature at each point.

Subsequently, the paper computes the proportion of probability mass within the tubular neighborhood and the Wasserstein distance using the late initialization scheme. Through various experiments involving toy models and the MNIST dataset, the paper concludes that the phase transition corresponds to a rapid decrease in the proportion of particles outside the tubular neighborhood and a sharp increase in the Wasserstein distance. This study illuminates how geometrical structure interacts with the training and inference process of diffusion models, paving the way for further research to develop specific algorithms accordingly."

Consequently, for any chosen radius (which may or may not be the injectivity radius), a corresponding tubular neighborhood can be defined. Furthermore, based on my understanding, the red curves in all the figures exhibit a similar trend, given the characteristics of the forward process. So it is unclear if the injectivity radius defined in the paper is a pivotal factor for this phenomenon to appear.\n- In several experiments, the timing of the increase in the Wasserstein distance does not precisely align with the 0.99 threshold. This suggests that the conjecture may be attributed to a coincidental association with the exponential diffusion of singularities in the OU process.\n\nTo strengthen the conjecture, additional experiments are necessary to provide corroborating evidence. These experiments could include:\n- Statistical and quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the Wasserstein distance and the proportion within the tubular neighborhood.\n- Experiments conducted on a family of datasets with varying injectivity radii, where the corresponding curves are observed and their relationships with the injectivity radii are assessed.\n- Reparameterization of the inference process to extend the final portion, enabling a more precise observation of the phase transition."

To go beyond the very symmetric cases discussed in (Raya, 2023), the authors study the injectivity radius of the manifold, which is the supremum of possible radii of tubular neighborhoods of the manifold. The main idea is that, if at time t the probability mass of the forward kernel is mostly inside the maximal tubular neighborhood, then  all 'generative decisions' are already been made and the particles are projected by the score with high probability on a single well-defined target point. \nTherefore, at least locally, there will be a finite value of t at which the symmetries of the generative process break spontaneously, meaning that, around a given point of the manifold, the distributions of the generative paths collapse on deterministic targets. \nThe authors show that these local phase transitions depend on the curvature of the manifold, with higher curvature leading to later critical collapse times. This time corresponds to the disappearance of singularities (i.e. points of non-smoothness) on the epsilon-neighborhood of the manifold.\n\nThe paper contains both theoretical results and experimental analyses on real datasets. The main result of the theoretical analysis is the characterization of the critical times based on the local curvature. The experiments show the results of late initialization as a way of detecting the first symmetry breaking event as introduced in (Raya, 2023). The authors carefully control the geometry of the target data and the deviation of the distributions in order to control the phenomenon of mean and covariance shift prior to the symmetry breaking event."

These new tools offer an important stepping stone in our theoretical understanding of generative diffusion and its relations with fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics and differential geometry.\n\nThe theoretical analysis has the rare property of being both rather rigorous and beautifully intuitive.

                "value": "I think that the main missing link in the paper is a direct connection with the fixed-point method used in (Raya, 2023). In geometric settings, if the data distribution is uniform when restricted to the manifold, it is possible to define the latent manifold at time t as the set of stable fixed points of the vector field, i.e. the minima of the potential energy function. \nIntuitively, the appearance of a singularity in your framework should correspond to the 'collapse' of a portion of the data manifold into a single point in the latent manifold at time t, this is equivalent to the bifurcation of isolated fixed-points corresponding to Curie-Weiss type transitions. For example, it is easy to see that a hyper-sphere collapses into a single latent point when the injective radius is exceeded. \nIn the general case of unequal curvature, I would surmise that this phenomenon happens locally. \nIt would therefore be very insightful to study how these geometric singularities correspond to the geometry of the potential energy function, which will connect the theory more directly with the theory of critical phase transitions in physics.\n\n\nI see two further weak points in the analysis, which however could be addressed in future work.\n\n1) While it is interesting to study the first symmetry breaking event as the main phase transitions, it would be insightful to provide a more detailed analysis on the multiple critical times that arise in manifolds with non constant curvature. Under your model, the first critical time corresponds to the disappearance of the singularities around the points with the highest curvature. This is the first visible symmetry breaking event and it therefore demarcates the first main deviation from approximate Gaussianity in the marginal distribution, as visible from the late initialization curves.\nWhile this effect is very visible and very important in the generative process, it is not necessarily more conceptually important than the further critical times corresponding to regions with lower curvature. In fact, at least locally, these correspond to other genuine critical transitions where important 'generative decisions' are made to spontaneous symmetry breaking events.\n\nWhile the theory can be easily applied to the analysis of these subsequent transitions, I would have appreciated direct experimental verification of these events under controlled conditions. Note that this would required a different approach than that used in the late initialization experiments. \n\n2) It would have been very nice to have a characterization of the phase transitions in this geometric setting in the language of statistical physics, since the connection with (Raya, 2023) suggests a deep link.
