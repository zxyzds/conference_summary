    "title": "Data Augmentation via Genomic Foundation Models for Pseudoknot-Inclusive RNA Secondary Structure Prediction",
    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in genomic foundation models (GFMs) have delivered a series of breakthroughs across a diverse set of tasks for RNA, however RNA Secondary Structure Prediction (SSP) remains a pivotal task in computational biology. Despite achieving breakthroughs in pseudoknot-free SSP, where state-of-the-art models can achieve above 80% macro-F1, performance on the pseudoknot-inclusive problem remains stagnate, with previous methods achieving below 50% macro-F1 on all three of our test-sets. This is due to a variety of challenges: a ginormous search space that limits heuristic performance, the major class imbalance problem that limits the usual classification methods, and the inherent lack of data that limits deep learning methods. Further data acquisition is implausible due to requiring extensive biological resources and being associated with a high cost. \nIn this work, we propose a novel approach to enhance RNA secondary structure prediction by implementing a novel data augmentation technique, specifically designed for the pseudoknot-inclusive SSP problem. Our method leverages masked language modelling (MLM) with a surrogate model to produce accurate and useful data augmentations, and we further utilise uncertainty quantification strategies to identify areas within the dataset where augmentation is most effective - thereby helping to mitigate the class imbalance problem, and further improving on the generalisability of the models. We further extend three GFMs, and fine-tune them using the augmented datasets to demonstrate the efficacy and high performance of the models.\nNotably, the newly extended and augmented models achieve state-of-the-art performance, achieving over 89% F1 on RNAStrAlign, and over 66% F1 on bpRNA test sets respectively. We therefore highlight the effectiveness of data augmentation for genomic data, and release our code and datasets to assist future researchers.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major issues:\n\n- The authors claim state-of-the-art performance, however, while the RNAStrAlign and BpRNA-1m datasets have been widely used in previous work, the authors unnecessarily introduce a new training/validation/test split which makes the results incomparable to previous work. For example in [1], a PK-Test set, split from the BpRNA (and Rfam) set, is used with a proposed model showing strong performance (F1-score > 70). Furthermore, there are existing testsets, TS0-3 and TS-hard, introduced in [2] and [3], that are regularly used for benchmarking of RNA secondary structure prediction. Why do the authors have to introduce a new dataset? Why do the authors not simply use the PK-structures of the existing sets to be more comparable?\n- A comparison to sota methods is completely lacking. IPKnot and PKiss are currently *NOT* considered state-of-the-art. In addition PKiss can predict only a subset of PKs. This is not mentioned in the paper.\n- The timeliness of the work is questionable. Since the augmentation technique only considers secondary structures represented in dot-bracket notation, new state-of-the-art deep learning methods cannot benefit from the method. In addition, the representation of RNA secondary structures as adjacency matrices is one of the key advantages of recent deep learning based methods compared to more traditional, dynamic programming approaches. This limitation is not discussed at all in the paper.\n- The authors claim to introduce two new pseudoknot-inclusive datasets while preventing \u201cdata leakage from structurally similar sequences\u201d. However, the data is split using CD-Hit, which only considers sequence similarity. Several recent publications raised concerns about splitting RNA data based on sequence similarity only, which typically results in homologous training and test data (see e.g. [4, 5, 6]). Since RNA is often more conserved in structure, applying structural measures is crucial during data splitting.\n- The authors do not include deep learning based approaches in their experiments because \u201cthey utilise a differing data-format \u2026 (BPSEQ)\u201d. This is not generally true, for example [7] is based on string representations in dot-bracket format.\n- The proposed method only works for Single Nucleotide Tokenization Methods. This clearly is a limitation of the proposed method but it is sold as if k-mer or BPE tokenization is a limitation of other foundation models. While different tokenization methods are still discussed in the literature for genomic foundation models, this limitation of the proposed approach is not discussed in the paper. As a side note, [7] uses single nucleotide tokenization.\n- Generally, the work doesn\u2019t show much novelty, is very specific, and I don't think that it does align very much with the ICLR audience. \n\nMinor aspects:\n\n- [Line 055/056] \u201cYet these benchmarks do not consider the pseudoknot\u2026\u201d\nThis is not true. At least the cited RNABench contains tasks including pseudoknot predictions. Moreover, RNABench includes tasks that consider even base multiplets, which cannot be represented in dot-bracket notation.\n\n- [Lines 067-070] \u201c[...] NP-Hard, thus dynamic programming-based methods require polynomial time [...]\u201d\nThis sentence contains a contradiction unless P = NP.\n\n- [Line 079] \u201c[...] researchers have increasingly turned to data augmentation [...]\u201d\nThe cited work in [8] to support this claim does not use data augmentations.\n\n- The work ignores the fact that the BpRNA dataset reports pseudoknots up to a page number of 7 (although only a very small fraction of PKs falls into this category), while the authors only consider a page number of 4. However, rare PKs would be a very interesting example for the work, because of even stronger class imbalance.\n\n- I might have missed it but the abbreviation UQ (Line 268) is not introduced.\n\n\n[1] Gong, T., Ju, F., & Bu, D.
