    "abstract": "Curriculum learning aims to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) by generating curricula, i.e., sequences of tasks of increasing difficulty. \nAlthough existing curriculum generation approaches provide benefits in sample efficiency, they overlook safety-critical settings where an RL agent must adhere to safety constraints.\nThus, these approaches may generate tasks that cause RL agents to violate safety constraints during training and behave suboptimally after. \nWe develop a safe curriculum generation approach (SCG) that aligns the objectives of constrained RL and curriculum learning: improving safety during training and boosting sample efficiency.\nSCG generates sequences of tasks where the RL agent can be safe and performant by initially generating tasks with minimum safety violations over high-reward ones.\nWe empirically show that compared to the state-of-the-art curriculum learning approaches and their naively modified safe versions, SCG achieves optimal performance and the lowest amount of constraint violations during training.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The biggest weakness of this work is the lack of a demonstration of scalability. The 2-d navigation task with 2-d goals provides a very small space for curriculum design where all tasks can be approximately enumerated. It is unclear how this approach would scale to situations where the spaces of possible tasks is combinatorially large. However, as this is a concern that is shared with much of the prior work, I do not see this as a reason in itself to reject the paper.\n\nThe main limitation keeping me from raising my score is that it appears the impact of this work is currently somewhat limited. This is in-part because of the scale, in part because the gains on both safety and performance are not as dramatic as one would hope, and in part because it appears to be far from the point where it could be tested in concrete applications. My evaluation of this paper would be significantly higher if it were shown to be applicable to a robotics domain, where safety during training is a critical component. I am guessing this is not in the current draft because it is difficult to scale underlying methods like CURROT to those domains, but if that is the case, then it is not clear if this approach would still be applicable with whatever approach does eventually scale. These uncertainties make it less clear for the reader what to take away from this paper for their own future research. \n\nThe one point where the paper can be made significantly more clear is explaining the apparently constraint-violating tasks in Figure 5 c and Figure 3 (right). My sense is that these tasks are not as constraint-violating as they seem since they have a high-tolerance, but it cannot be confirmed from the diagram since there is no correspondence between color and radius of the tolerance. I think this could be resolved by adding a few circles to-scale to ones side of these figures which visually depicts what color would correspond to a given radius. This could then let me check that the tolerance of the radius is sufficient to let the agent avoid a constraint violation.\n\nMinor point: \n- 188 and 193 I think these sentences do not completely describe the objective, since they does not say what happens when \"finding the optimal policy\" and \"minimising the constrained violation regret\" are in tension."
