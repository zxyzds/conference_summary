    "title": "Procedural Fairness Through Addressing Social Determinants of Opportunity",
    "abstract": "_Social determinants of opportunity_ are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual, e.g., environmental pollution in an area affects individual's health condition, and educational resources in an neighborhood influence individual's academic preparedness. Previous algorithmic fairness literature often overlooks _social determinants of opportunity_, leading to implications for procedural fairness and structural justice that are incomplete and potentially even inaccurate. We propose a modeling framework that explicitly incorporates _social determinants of opportunity_ and their causal influences on individual-level attributes of interest. To demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability of our framework, we consider college admissions as a running example. Specifically, for three mainstream admission procedures that have historically been implemented or are still in use today, we distinguish and draw connections between the outcome of admission decision-making and the underlying distribution of academic preparedness in the applicant population. Our findings suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around protected features may introduce new procedural unfairness when addressing existing discrimination. Considering both individual-level attributes and _social determinants of opportunity_ facilitates a more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving procedural fairness effectively and transparently.",

                "value": "First of all, I am not sure if this conference is a good fit for this paper/topic since it is from my perspective hardly at all concerned with \"learning representation\". It is more a general societal consideration about how fairness could be achieved.\n\nWhile the claim of the paper is to discuss the \"social determinants of opportunity\" in general, the discussion focusses very much on a single use case, i.e., university admissions.\n\nThe paper is written in a very US-centric way, specifically considering the legal situation.\n\nThe case considerations in Section 4 often (e.g., Section 4.3.) come to conclusions that are quite trivial. E.g., that taking the top-x % per region increases the share of \"weaker\" regions was literally my first thought. The accompanying formulas appear to just make a trivial insight more sophisticated.\n\nThe authors should more critically reflect on their approach. For example,\n(i) even if \"academic preparedness\" is caused by certain external factors, isn't academic preparedness still a key factor to a succesful university curriculum? If someone is not well prepared for university, they should not be admitted - that should be at the core of all admission procedures\n(ii) the legal implications of adjusting for \"social determinants of opportunity\" should be considered, specifically if this correlates with sensitive attributes such as race. \n(iii) trying to form groups again beyond sensitive attributes - again - introduces new sources of unfairness. For example \"poor\" students growing up in \"rich\" regions. Also, if this kind of admission procedure would gain traction, it would also be possible to trick procedures, e.g. for \"rich\" people renting temporarily to appear to be from a \"poor\" region.\n\nThe assumptions in the paper appear to be somewhat arbitrary. E.g., why assume the gamma parameterization in 4.3., and how is this justified?\n\nThe writing of the paper should also be improved. For example, what is the purpose of Section 2.1. For the contents of the paper?"

                "value": "Ultimately, the theoretical results in this paper do not provide novel insight, and the empirical results aren't very interesting or plausible. The model is used to show that:\n\n1. Quota-based affirmative action harms disadvantaged members of majority groups.\n2. \"Plus factors\" for being from an underrepresented group benefit advantaged members of that group more than disadvantaged members.\n3. \"Top-percent\" policies that are blind to ethnicity reallocate opportunity to regions with less of it.\n\nAll three of these findings are well-known, and have been part of the debate around these policies for decades. The model doesn't provide extra insights into these policies. \n\nWhen the model is deployed on real data, it also doesn't provide insights. It seems as though the admissions data from Berkeley is too censored to study the impacts of social determinants of opportunity, since it doesn't include anything about an applicant's geography beyond whether they are in-state. The regions inferred by the model don\u2019t make a lot of sense given what we know about California\u2019s ethnic geography (eg they don't show any signs of the racial segregation induced by California's restrictive housing policies)."

Since these graphs typically only use a handful of features, I don\u2019t think this edge is an endorsement of racial essentialism - it just summarizes dozens of effects that the model is too coarse to model explicitly.\n\n>\u201cIf a certain edge or path in the causal model does not reflect an actual real-world causal process, subsequent causal fairness analyses based on causal effects may not provide informative conclusions.\u201d\n\nThis is certainly true, but to my knowledge not a single causal graph in history has ever actually described a real-world causal process where humans were involved. It\u2019s extremely difficult to establish single treatment effects, let alone a network of them."

Then, framing academic preparedness as an optimization problem, the authors find a correlation between race and social determinants of opportunity, using GPA as an estimation of academic preparedness and analyzing data from the University of California's admissions data. As an analysis of existing data, this work proposes modeling protected characteristics and studying the influence of contexts and environments on the individual for fairness analysis."

The authors briefly discuss their experimental findings but the three separate graphs in Figure 3 could have benefitted from further discussion, particularly in relation to each other and how the correlation between race and social discriminators of opportunity correlates with understanding academic preparedness in a region. Potentially interleaving the methods and providing experimental results for the modeling of past admissions systems could have provided more tractable examples of how this framework compares to prior work."
