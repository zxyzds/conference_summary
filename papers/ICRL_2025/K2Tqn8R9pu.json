    "title": "Gaussian Differentially Private Human Faces Under a Face Radial Curve Representation",
    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of releasing a Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) 3D human face. The human face is a complex structure with many features and inherently tied to one's identity.  Protecting this data, in a formally private way, is important yet challenging given the dimensionality of the problem. We extend approximate DP techniques for functional data to the GDP framework. We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget. Our mechanism consists of two primary components, the first is generally applicable to function value summaries (as are commonly found in nonparametric statistics or functional data analysis) while the second is general to disk-like surfaces and hence more applicable than just to human faces.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a method for creating Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) representations of 3D human faces using a novel face radial curve representation. The proposed approach aims to address privacy concerns associated with sharing 3D facial data by employing differential privacy (DP) mechanisms. This method leverages statistical shape analysis to represent faces in a disk-parameterized structure, ensuring minimal noise addition while preserving the facial structure. The approach is specifically designed for applications that involve facial data but could extend to other disk-like surface data. The paper also presents experimental results demonstrating that the method injects less noise compared to point-wise differential privacy approaches while effectively preserving facial features."

The paper presents a novel approach to 3D face representation for privacy preservation using face radial curves, which is innovative and highly relevant to privacy concerns in biometric data.\n\n2. The GDP mechanism integrated into this method ensures that facial features are preserved with minimal noise injection, enhancing privacy while maintaining utility.\n\n3. The manuscript includes thorough experiments comparing the proposed method with traditional point-wise differential privacy techniques, demonstrating superior noise reduction and structure preservation."

                "value": "1. **Manuscript Organization**: The paper would benefit from a more structured organization aligned with the standard conference paper layout in AI. The current structure is challenging to follow, and the clarity could be enhanced by including diagrams that illustrate the overall pipeline of the proposed method. Guiding sentences that introduce and connect sections and paragraphs would also help readers navigate the content more effectively.\n\n2. **Assumptions on Data Structure**: The proposed approach assumes a genus-0 surface with no missing data points, which may not be realistic in practical settings. This limitation necessitates additional pre-processing for noisy or incomplete data. Expanding the discussion on how the method could handle such cases would improve its practical applicability.\n\n3. **Limited Dataset and Generalizability**: The evaluation is conducted on a limited dataset without a detailed description of its statistics, raising concerns about the method\u2019s generalizability. While the authors suggest that this approach could extend to applications such as terrain models, no experiments support this claim. More comprehensive testing, including diverse or noisy datasets, is recommended to validate the method\u2019s broader applicability.\n\n4. **Computational Efficiency and Benchmarking**: Although the algorithm's methodology is well-described, the computational cost is not evaluated, which limits the ability to assess its practical performance. Additionally, the benchmark methods used for comparison are not clearly described, which could be clarified to provide a more comprehensive context for evaluating the proposed approach."
