    "abstract": "Aligning pretrained language models (LMs) is a complex and resource-intensive process, often requiring access to large amounts of ground-truth preference data and substantial compute. Are these costs necessary? That is, is it possible to align using only inherent model knowledge and without additional training? We tackle this challenge with AlignEZ, a novel approach that uses (1) self-generated preference data and (2) representation editing to provide nearly cost-free alignment. During inference, AlignEZ modifies LM representations to reduce undesirable and boost desirable components using subspaces identified via self-generated preference pairs. Our experiments reveal that this nearly cost-free procedure significantly narrows the gap between base pretrained and tuned models by an average of 29.1%, observed across five datasets and two model architectures. Additionally, we explore the potential of using AlignEZ as a means of expediting more expensive alignment procedures.  Our experiments show that AlignEZ improves DPO models tuned only using a small subset of ground-truth preference data.",

                "value": "This paper introduces AlignEZ, a method for aligning large language models (LMs) with human preferences without using additional training data or fine-tuning. The approach addresses the high costs associated with traditional alignment methods that require extensive human-annotated data and fine-tuning. AlignEZ leverages self-generated preference data by prompting the base model to produce examples of \u201chelpful\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d responses, thereby creating synthetic data that approximates human preferences. During inference, AlignEZ performs representation editing, modifying model embeddings to accentuate desirable (helpful) and reduce undesirable (harmful) components. This enables alignment without training, relying instead on adjustments to the model\u2019s representations in real time.\n\nEmpirically, AlignEZ narrows the performance gap between base and aligned models by 29.1% on average across multiple datasets and architectures, demonstrating that it can boost alignment quality in a cost-effective manner. In experiments, AlignEZ also expedites traditional alignment processes like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhancing model performance even when only a small subset of ground-truth data is available. Additionally, AlignEZ integrates effectively with prompting techniques, yielding further improvements beyond what prompting alone can achieve."

By eliminating reliance on costly fine-tuning and human-annotated preference data, AlignEZ offers a more resource-efficient alternative to traditional alignment techniques, making it potentially scalable for larger or real-time applications.\n2. AlignEZ presents a conceptually straightforward approach, leveraging self-generated preference data and representation editing to achieve alignment without the need for extensive fine-tuning or additional ground-truth annotations.\n3.  Empirically, the approach demonstrates substantial performance gains over DPO baselines, showing that AlignEZ is effective even when traditional alignment data is limited. It also improves data efficiency by expediting existing RLHF methods, like DPO. \n4. Moreover, AlignEZ integrates well with prompting strategies, enhancing alignment performance beyond what prompting alone achieves and expanding its usability with other alignment techniques. Prompting method is another cheap way to align LLMs without much cost and it's good to see both methods can be combined strongly."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. While AlignEZ combines self-generated preference data and representation editing effectively, both of these approaches are well-established methods. Techniques for generating synthetic preference data have been extensively studied in self-alignment literature, which limits the technical novelty of this work. To strengthen its contribution, the authors could further emphasize unique aspects of their integration of these techniques or explore additional novel dimensions, such as adaptive mechanisms for more refined, context-dependent alignment adjustments.\n2. The concept of \"free\" alignment in AlignEZ may be somewhat overstated, as both the self-generation of preference data and embedding modifications require non-negligible computational resources. While ALIGNEZ reduces reliance on human-labeled data, it does not entirely eliminate costs, especially when scaling to larger models. Clarifying these claims by discussing cost reductions relative to traditional methods, rather than \"free\" alignment, would provide a more balanced and realistic portrayal of AlignEZ's cost efficiency.\n3. Similarly, the title, \u201cIs Free Self-Alignment Possible?\u201d may prioritize entertainment value over clarity, providing limited insight into the paper\u2019s actual contributions. A more precise framing, such as \u201cCost-Efficient Self-Alignment through Representation Editing and Self-Generated Data,\u201d could better communicate the scope and implications of the study.\n4. The theoretical analysis presented in Section 3 is built on simplifying assumptions that may not fully capture the complexities of real-world model behavior. Specifically, the assumption that LLM space is orthonormal is oversimplified. Also, the conclusion is unclear enough to specify whether the singular vectors from AlignEZ are strong enough or whether the kNN smoothing is good enough, etc\n5. The empirical results are based on relatively small language models (7B and 8B parameters), which, given the rapid advancements in AI, are now considered less representative of state-of-the-art capabilities. Applying ALIGNEZ to significantly larger models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) would provide stronger evidence of its scalability and effectiveness in larger, more complex architectures. While it is challenging to access larger models due to their proprietary nature, exploring ways to adapt ALIGNEZ for environments where parameter access is limited, or testing it on larger open-source models, could strengthen its empirical validation. Additionally, the reliance on open-source models might be seen as a minor limitation, as this restricts ALIGNEZ\u2019s applicability to cases where model weights are accessible, potentially narrowing its practical impact in real-world, production-level systems that often employ closed-source models."

While the paper shows the compatibility of this method with the prompting method, I wonder about the head-to-head comparison of the proposed technique and prompting technique in improving the alignment performance of LLMs, since both are very cheap methods,\n2. Any fun visualization or analyses on the \"help\" and \"harm\" vector space?\n3. Any thoughts on the reward-guided test-time alignment techniques? This is related to the efficiency alignment techniques, although it's not closely related to the techniques in this paper per se."

The authors conduct additional experiments to confirm that their method is orthogonal to prompting techniques such as URIAL. This enhances the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach."

                "value": "1. The comparison with the baselines appears somewhat unfair. While the baseline test-time alignment techniques utilize ground-truth preference signals, these signals are sourced from a different dataset (HH-RLHF), introducing a distribution shift compared to the data used in AlignEZ. To provide a more balanced comparison, I suggest evaluating AlignEZ using the same HH-RLHF data during inference.\n\n2. Concerning practicality and efficiency, the authors do not provide details on the overhead induced by their method, particularly in terms of inference latency or memory utilization. It would be beneficial to compare these overheads against those of the baseline methods.\n\n3. It remains unclear whether AlignEZ affects other critical aspects, such as model safety or propensity for hallucination. I recommend including a discussion or experiments that assess the potential impact of AlignEZ on these factors.\n\n4. A highly viable and practical application of test-time alignment is personalization, rather than just general helpfulness (which is already addressed by the aligned versions of many models). Moreover, the dataset used in this paper is somewhat outdated. Providing experiments or insights focused on personalization could offer valuable contributions and make the paper more relevant."

Could you provide insights or experiments on this?\n\n2. Could using k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search to retrieve responses as in-context examples when prompting the model further enhance its alignment abilities, instead of just using this in the sample-conditional estimation of helpful and harmful direction."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Unclear Methodology: The description of the method's details is vague, particularly regarding the origin of queries used for generating self-generated preference data. Additionally, it's unclear which dataset was used for the experiments shown in Figures 3 and 4, and whether the reported $\\Delta%$ represents an average score across multiple datasets or results from a single dataset.\n\n2. Dependence on base LM: The base LM may generate incorrect preference data, and the paper does not clarify how it ensures that self-generated preference data accurately reflects the correct preference relationships. This lack of clarity could significantly impact the results. Furthermore, while the method shows some effectiveness on the base LM, its performance on instruction-tuned LMs remains unexplored, limiting its contribution. For example, in the experiment for Figure 3, the performance with and without ALIGNEZ when the DPO dataset is expanded to 100% is not assessed.\n\n3. Generalizability Issues: ALIGNEZ uses a statistical method (kNN) to obtain feature vectors for embedding editing during inference, raising concerns about its generalizability. It may only be effective when the inference input data is strongly correlated with the statistical data, making it difficult to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) situations.\n\n4. Narrow Focus on Helpfulness: A significant limitation of the paper is its narrow focus on helpfulness, which does not convincingly demonstrate the overall effectiveness of ALIGNEZ. This raises doubts about whether ALIGNEZ is universally applicable to other aspects, such as safety or more complex alignment scenarios that involve a mix of helpfulness and safety. More extensive testing would strengthen the paper's claims.\n\n5. Dependency on LLM's Instruction-Following Ability: Since ALIGNEZ relies on self-generated data to identify subspaces in the LM's embedding spaces corresponding to helpful and harmful directions for alignment, it requires a high degree of instruction-following capability from the LLM. This suggests that the method is better suited for models that have undergone instruction fine-tuning or alignment. However, the experiments are primarily conducted on the base pretrained model, which may not adequately reflect the method's potential effectiveness in more refined contexts."
