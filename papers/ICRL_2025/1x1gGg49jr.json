    "title": "SurFhead: Affine Rig Blending for Geometrically Accurate 2D Gaussian Surfel Head Avatars",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in head avatar rendering using Gaussian primitives have achieved significantly high-fidelity results. Although precise head geometry is crucial for applications like mesh reconstruction and relighting, current methods struggle to capture intricate geometric details and render unseen poses due to their reliance on similarity transformations, which cannot handle stretch and shear transforms essential for detailed deformations of geometry. To address this, we propose SurFhead, a novel method that reconstructs riggable head geometry from RGB videos using 2D Gaussian surfels, which offer well-defined geometric properties, such as precise depth from fixed ray intersections and normals derived from their surface orientation, making them advantageous over 3D counterparts. SurFhead ensures high-fidelity rendering of both normals and images, even in extreme poses, by leveraging classical mesh-based deformation transfer and affine transformation interpolation. SurFhead introduces precise geometric deformation and blends surfels through polar decomposition of transformations, including those affecting normals. Our key contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as mesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous avatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven by Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.",

                "value": "This paper presents a method for learning head avatars based on 2D Gaussian splatting. To make the Gaussian surfels better handle the stretch and shear deformation under extreme poses and facial expressions, this paper introduces affine transformation derived from Jacobian deformation gradient of the surface. Normal orientations are calculated accordingly. Moreover, the authors propose Jacobian blend skinning to interpolate these affine transformations to ensure surface smoothness. Results show that the proposed method is able to reconstruct drivable head avatars with high-quality geometry."

Although the authors have already compared with SplattingAvatar and GaussianAvatar, I think an additional comparison against GHA is also necessary because GHA demonstrates high-resolution image synthesis with the assistance of a super-resolution module. \n\n* It would be better if the authors report the training time and rendering speed. One important advantage of Gaussian splatting is its efficiency. I wonder whether the proposed techniques (such as Jacobian blend skinning) hinders this advantage or not. \n\n* It is not clear how the proposed method performs for subjects wearing eye-glasses. NeRSemble dataset contains cases with eye-glasses, but they are suspiciously skipped in the experiments."

Which transformation, $J$ or $J_b$, is used in the final method?  \n* The paper measures the normal similarity between ground-truth normals and rendered normals from 2D Gaussians. However, since this work claims to achieve a better geometry, evaluating metrics that apply to meshes, such as Chamfer distance or normals rendered from the mesh is more informative when judging the geometry. Although previous methods use normals rendered from 2D Gaussians as proof of geometry, the link between it and the mesh quality still looks vague to me.\n* As the rendering quality is only on par with state-of-the-art, e.g., GaussianAvatar, the comparison of training and rendering speed is missing."

What are the meanings of the green and yellow lines and the weights? How do they connect to the deformation of the triangle meshes?\n* The paper mainly focuses on improving the geometry. Since 2D Gaussian splatting is known to produce better geometry than 3D Gaussians, how much does 2D Gaussians help improve the geometry, compared to the components proposed in the paper?"

In this regard, we eagerly inquire whether the proposed method heavily relies on such relatively accurate 3D mesh models, and how it would perform in their absence.     To validate this, the authors could consider using videos they have shot or sourced from the internet as input, employing monocular facial 3D reconstruction algorithms (such as DECA) to obtain mesh sequences, or directly bypassing the use of 3D mesh models altogether.
