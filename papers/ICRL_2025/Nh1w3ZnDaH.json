    "abstract": "Unpaired point cloud completion explores methods for learning a completion map from unpaired incomplete and complete point cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unpaired point cloud completion using the unbalanced optimal transport map, called Unbalanced Optimal Transport Map for Unpaired Point Cloud Completion (UOT-UPC). We demonstrate that the unpaired point cloud completion can be naturally interpreted as the Optimal Transport (OT) problem and introduce the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) approach to address the class imbalance problem, which is prevalent in unpaired point cloud completion datasets. \nMoreover, we analyze the appropriate cost function for unpaired completion tasks. This analysis shows that the InfoCD cost function is particularly well-suited for this task.\nOur model is the first attempt to leverage UOT for unpaired point cloud completion, achieving competitive or superior results on both single-category and multi-category datasets. In particular, our model is especially effective in scenarios with class imbalance, where the proportions of categories are different between the incomplete and complete point cloud datasets.",

The key idea is to train a model that learns the UOT map between the distribution of incomplete point clouds and the distribution of complete point clouds. This approach leverages the UOT framework's ability to address the class imbalance problem commonly found in unpaired point cloud completion datasets. The paper also identifies the InfoCD cost function as particularly well-suited for unpaired point cloud completion tasks. Experiments show that using InfoCD leads to better performance compared to other cost functions like l2, L2-Chamfer distance, and one-directional L2-Chamfer distance."

                "value": "1. Limited Cost Function Exploration: The paper's claim of identifying the \"optimal\" cost function can be challenged. While the authors compare four different cost functions (l2, L2-Chamfer distance (cdl2), one-directional L2-Chamfer distance (cdl2fwd), and InfoCD), this is a relatively small selection of potential options. Other cost functions might exist that could yield even better performance. The study primarily relies on the ShapeNet dataset for evaluating these cost functions. \n\n2. Dataset Dependence: The experiments primarily focus on a single dataset proposed in Ma et al. 2023, despite the availability of other datasets in the field. This raises concerns about the generalizability of UOT-UPC's performance to other datasets. Evaluating the model on a wider variety of datasets would strengthen the paper's conclusions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of UOT-UPC's capabilities and limitations."
