    "title": "Invisibility Stickers Against LiDAR: Adversarial Attacks on Point Cloud Intensity for LiDAR-based Detection",
    "abstract": "Point cloud detection is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving systems and robotics. These systems utilize onboard LiDAR sensors to capture input point clouds, consisting of numerous three-dimensional coordinate points and their corresponding intensity of laser reflection. Recent studies have proposed various adversarial schemes to highlight the vulnerability of point cloud detectors. However, these studies primarily focused on generating or perturbing the coordinate positions of input points and are hard to attack in the physical world, while largely overlooking the significance of their intensity.\tThrough our exploration, we found that perturbing point cloud intensity poses significant security risks for point cloud object detectors. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attack on point cloud intensity and we propose an effective adversarial attack scheme, named I-ADV. Our method employs a voxel partition scheme to enhance physical implementation. To boost attack performance, we incorporate a gradient enhancement technique using 3D angle and distance features, along with an extremum-based gradient fusion strategy.\tExtensive experimental results demonstrate that by altering only point cloud intensity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across detectors with various input representations, attaining attack success rates between 83.9% and 99.1%. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness and generality of the method\u2019s components. Additionally, comparing different attack schemes underscores the advantages of our point cloud intensity attack method in both performance and real-world applicability.",

                "value": "This paper proposes an intensity-based voxel-wise attack method called I-ADV for learning-based 3D detectors. I-ADV considers two intensity-related features: 3D angle and distance. The intensity perturbation is optimized using an extremum-based fusion method. The approach is evaluated on the KITTI dataset for the 3D detection of car category and demonstrates superior performance compared to other geometry-based baselines in terms of attack success rate."

I-ADV is a gradient-based attack method that updates perturbations based on the gradient sign during iterations. Its main features can be summarized in three points: voxel-level updates, a gradient enhancement technique that combines 3D angle and distance features, and an extremum-based gradient fusion strategy. The voxel-level attack enhances the method's applicability in the real world, while the proposed gradient enhancement technique and gradient fusion strategy improve the performance of I-ADV. In the authors' experimental setup, the latter contributed to an over 40% increase in attack success rate."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The main weaknesses of this paper lie in the experimental section. The experiments conducted in the paper are all carried out in the digital domain, and the attack method of \"invisible stickers\" mentioned in the title is not reflected in the experiments. Moreover, the paper fails to adequately consider the issues encountered in real-world scenarios. In fact, aside from the material issues and multi-sensor problems mentioned by the authors in the limitations section, there are many unavoidable problems, such as the dynamic changes in external lighting and laser incidence angles affecting echo intensity in dynamic environments. Furthermore, I believe there are unreasonable aspects in the experimental setup used in the paper, which include the following concerns:\n1.\tThe use of global perturbations in the experiments raises my concerns about practicality. Although voxel-level perturbations are more realistic than point-level perturbations, controlling the reflection intensity across an entire vehicle is not feasible.\n2.\tIn the main experiments of the paper, the maximum perturbation limit is set to 1, allowing the intensity of all points to vary freely between [0, 1], which further increases my concerns about practicality.\nOverall, I believe that what the authors demonstrate is more of a theoretical possibility rather than physical realizability, and I am concerned about the rationality of the experimental setup."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Apart from about the usability of the methods, my main concerns are as follows:\n\tThe ablation results in Table 3 indicate that extremum-based gradient fusion strategy contributes the most to the results. However, the paper neither explains the motivation for adopting this fusion strategy nor analyzes why it outperforms other strategies. It would be better if the authors could include a discussion on this aspect.\n\tI noticed that in the visualization of Figure 4, various attack methods tend to extreme the intensity of points, with the sample point cloud primarily consisting of low-intensity points (blue) and high-intensity points (red). Additionally, the greater the number of high-intensity points, the better the performance of the attack. I also found a recent study [1] indicating that increasing the intensity of the point cloud can significantly reduce the detector's confidence. Considering that the experiment allows the intensity of all points to vary freely between [0, 1], I wonder if the significant improvement of I-ADV comes from having more high-intensity points? If so, why not set the intensity of the point cloud directly to 1?\n\tI observed that Figure 3(a) presents results for smaller voxel sizes, and I estimate from the figure that the minimum setting is approximately 0.015 meters. The issue is that, at such a small voxel size, the vast majority of voxels containing points have only one point. Therefore, in Equation (8), we have g_(V_(m,+) )=g_(V_(m,-) ), leading to g_(V_(m,f) )=+, which indicates that the intensity of most points in the sample will continually increase until it is pushed to 1. This seems to support my observation in point 2. I hope the authors can provide specific settings for the voxel size in Figure 3(a) as well as the visual results under the minimum voxel size setting.\nIn addition to these, there are a few minor issues:\n\tLine 248: The statement \"We utilize the framework of MI-FGSM to access the gradients during iterative updates\" is confusing. I understand it corresponds to line 6 of Algorithm 1, but I do not grasp the meaning of \"access\" in this context. \n\tAlgorithm 1, line 6: The function L is not explained. I know it represents a loss related to classification, but I do not know what it specifically refers to. \n\tFigure 3: The x-axis label of the bar chart repeats the subtitles of the subplots.\n\n[1] Sako O, Sato T, Hayakawa Y, et al.
