    "title": "Reaction Graph: Toward Modeling Chemical Reactions  with 3D Molecular Structures",
    "abstract": "Accurately modeling chemical reactions using Artificial Intelligence (AI) can accelerate discovery and development, especially in fields like drug design and material science.  Although AI has made remarkable advancements in single molecule recognition, such as predicting molecular properties, the study of interactions between molecules, particularly chemical reactions, has been relatively overlooked. In this paper, we introduce Reaction Graph (RG), a unified graph representation that encapsulates the 3D molecular structures within chemical reactions.  RG integrates the molecular graphs of reactants and products into a cohesive framework, effectively capturing the interatomic relationships pertinent to the reaction process. Additionally, it incorporates the 3D structure information of molecules in a simple yet effective manner. We conduct experiments on a range of tasks, including chemical reaction classification, condition prediction,  and yield prediction. RG achieves the highest accuracy across six datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be publicly available.",

In the section about the implementation details, could the authors clarify what they mean with the iterative output technique to support beam search?  In page 6, line 295, the experiment results support their hypothesis but do not fully validate it, as Fig 3 only has a single example molecule.  Regarding the construction of Pistachio-Condition, how are the validation and testing splits selected? \n\n\nAlthough the addition of 3D features appears to consistently help, the effect is somewhat unclear.  For example, why is the lack of both reaction edge and 3D structure resulting in significantly higher accuracy in Table 4 than past method in Table 3?  In particular, could the authors clarify if and how the total parameter count changes when the 3D information was excluded and whether the hyperparameters were reoptimized for that network?  In addition to ablating and optimal model with 3D, demonstrating that there is room for improvement by simply adding 3D information to a previously optimal model would strengthen the message of this work.  I wonder if the current improvement in accuracy with the addition of the 3D representation in part stems from the reduction in the total parameter count."

Complementary to this point, have the authors considered separating Pistachio into folds of incremental difficulty (for example by atom count, scaffold size, or other metrics of synthetic difficulty) in order to perform a more detailed analysis of the additional contribution of 3D structure?  It would be interesting to investigate if there are classes of scaffolds where 3D helps and others where it is neutral or detrimental on average.\n\nHave the authors considered alternative modern ways to incorporate 3D information, such as equivariant neural networks?"

A torsion angle is defined as the dihedral angle between four connected atoms in a molecule. Molecules with different dihedral angles can show very different properties but are represented the same using the proposed representation method. The authors might need to state this explicitly as a limitation in the current version or provide a solution to this problem in future work.\n- Many tools are involved in preparing the dataset, such as MMFF for 3D coordinate generation, RXNMapper for reaction atom mapping, and NameRXN for labeling reactions. The authors might want to briefly comment on the application scope/accuracy of the methods used, as the accuracy of these methods significantly influences the data quality, and consequently, the benchmark results."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- It might be beneficial to provide general characteristics for each task type so that future papers can informatively discuss the tasks and compare methods. For reaction classification, many methods achieved almost perfect performance. Is it because the task is too simple? For yield prediction, there is a staggering difference between small and large datasets. This is due not only to the noise level in yield records (same reaction but different yield records) but also to the non-smooth surface of the structure-yield relationship (similar reaction but very different yield records). See examples here: https://www.rsc.org/suppdata/d3/sc/d3sc03902a/d3sc03902a2.pdf. As for reaction condition prediction, label canonicalization might be a performance consideration, as there could be multiple different names for a chemical entity. See this paper for an example of canonicalizing names: Figure 2A of https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c00098.\n- If I understand correctly, the current reaction global representation is a linear combination of node features. For an LSTM, the last hidden state contains the information about all previous nodes, which might also be a meaningful representation for the global reaction. How did the authors decide to use the linear combination instead of the hidden state?\n- Providing the definitions of CEN and MCC might be helpful for readers who are unfamiliar with these metrics. Besides, the F1 score is a common metric for binary classification tasks in science, as it considers label imbalance. Can the authors add the F1 score in Table 1?\n- Why did the authors choose to compute angular edges instead of using bond angle information? The latter seems more intuitive and is readily available via RDKit/common GNN models, so there is no need to compute the angular edges.\n- Writing can be more concise. For example, \"computational and mathematical chemistry\" could be \"computational chemistry\" (line 145).\n- What is \\( T_1 \\) in equation (3)?"

                "value": "1. Reproducibility Issues:\nCode not available during review process. The statement \"code will be available publicly\" is insufficient for scientific reproducibility. The review process itself should include access to the code and clear instructions for reproducing the results. This is particularly important in computational chemistry where reproducibility should be more straightforward than in experimental settings.\n\n2. Statistical Analysis Deficiencies:\nThe paper lacks crucial statistical analysis across all results. No uncertainty measurements (standard deviations, confidence intervals) are provided for the accuracy metrics. Without these, it's impossible to determine if the reported improvements are statistically significant or merely random variations. The authors should implement:\n     - Multiple trials with different random seeds\n     - Standard deviations for all metrics\n     - Appropriate statistical significance tests\n     - Cross-validation results\n     - Confidence intervals for performance metrics\n\n\n3. Limited Validation:\nThe authors' claim on page 6, line 295 that \"The experiment results validate our hypothesis\" is based on just two or three examples. This is methodologically unsound. Such limited examples cannot provide sufficient statistical power or account for the full diversity of chemical reactions. The paper needs:\n     - Comprehensive testing across many reaction types\n     - Analysis of edge cases and failure modes\n     - Statistical validation of the hypothesis\n     - Discussion of potential selection bias in examples\n\n4. Technical Clarity Issues:\n- The methodology surrounding the Reaction edge introduction requires significant clarification on several fronts. First, there is a citation issue regarding RXNMapper - the authors cite a paper that merely uses RXNMapper rather than the original methodology paper (available at https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74b2aee301c3c2cc79dac ). This should be corrected to properly credit the original work.\n- More substantially, the use of force field calculations for atomic coordinates raises several crucial questions that need to be addressed. The authors mention using MMFF94 to calculate atom coordinates, but provide no details about the conformational analysis. It's essential to know whether they used the lowest energy conformation, how they handled multiple possible conformations, and what impact different conformational choices might have on their results. Given that molecular conformation can significantly affect interatomic distances and geometric parameters, this could have substantial implications for their method's reliability and reproducibility.\n- The description of the edge length attribute needs elaboration. While it appears to be based on pairwise distances between selected vertices, the exact methodology isn't clear. If these are indeed simple pairwise distances, how do they account for conformational flexibility? If there's something more sophisticated at play, it needs to be explicitly described.\n- A fundamental question arises about whether the reaction graph generation uses products or reactants as its basis. This has important implications for the method's practical applicability. If it uses only reactants, the authors need to explain their methodology for 3D structure generation, particularly regarding the ordering of molecules and the calculation of geometric parameters like bond angles and pairwise distances.\n- The handling of molecular geometry deserves special attention. The authors should clarify their approach to calculating bond angles and whether they considered torsion angles in their analysis. The role of molecular conformation in these calculations is particularly important - did they investigate how different conformations affect their results? What criteria did they use to select specific conformations? Was any sensitivity analysis performed to assess the impact of conformational changes on their method's performance?\n- Additionally, there's an inconsistency in terminology throughout the paper that needs to be addressed. The authors alternate between using \"atoms\" for nodes, and \"bonds\" and \"edges\" for connections. While these terms are often used interchangeably in chemical graph theory, for clarity and precision, they should establish their terminology early in the paper and maintain consistency throughout. This would help readers better understand the relationship between the chemical and mathematical aspects of their approach.\n- These technical details are crucial for understanding the method's limitations and potential applications, as well as for ensuring reproducibility of the results. The authors should provide a comprehensive description of these aspects in their revision.\n\n5. Leaving Group Analysis While the leaving group identification analysis shows promising results, it requires:\n- Error analysis of misclassified cases\n- Comparison with additional baseline methods\n- Cross-validation results\n- Discussion of systematic errors or biases\n- Analysis of chemical pattern dependencies\n\n6. Runtime Analysis The runtime discussion in section 4.2 lacks essential details\n- System specifications\n- Benchmark conditions\n- Variability in performance\n- Hardware dependencies"

The concept of unifying reactants and products seems incremental (modeling individual molecules -> unifying reactants/products (Rxn Hypergraph) -> unifying both reactants and products (Reaction Graph)).\n2. The idea of utilizing 3D structures has been extensively explored in molecular modeling, and thus the novelty of extending its application to reaction modeling is limited.\n3. The efficiency analysis is insufficient, both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, the paper compares the efficiency of the proposed method with and without 3D structure information, rather than against other baseline methods. Theoretically, the complexity analysis in Appendix E.1 focuses solely on graph size without providing a formal complexity calculation of the entire computation process. Additionally, the authors should account for the additional computational burden in preprocessing steps (such as atomic mapping prediction)."

In the attention-based aggregation process (Line 230), why the authors choose the LSTM-based method which is relatively old (in 2016)?

The potential application of this work lies within the material science domain, primarily in Chemistry and drug design. \nThe authors introduce the concept of Reaction Graph (RG), which is a graph representation enhanced by 3D structural information.  \n\nOne of the key objections against previous methods in the field of study is that so-called \"reaction information\" that is relevant to the understanding of chemical reactions is usually overlooked and not used. In previous reaction modeling works, the main focus is still molecular representation learning. With that in mind, the authors propose a novel unified graph representation that includes a reaction edge. This additional edge links the same atoms on either side of the chemical reaction - from reagents to products respectively, hence, the inductive bias about the reaction itself is preserved during the message passing. \n\nExperiments were conducted for a wide range of tasks, and the method shows promising results."

Most of it showcases the schematics of other existing methods, while only the far right is important for the reader (Reaction Graph Pipeline). Since Fig.1 is referenced many times throughout the paper, those references point to a small fraction of the data. I'd suggest thinking about another layout, either several illustrations for several disjoint figures or even removing some unrelated to the contribution of this work illustrations (e.g. Molecule Graph, Rnx Hypergraph). You can still reference these works in the text. \n\n - In Fig. 3 it is not clear how to look for the \"Attention weight\" since the color bar has all the colors for a) different atom types; b) bromo-/amino-/other group highlights. Another question that arises, is what does \"Mismatch\" imply? \n \n\n I would strongly recommend proofreading the article again to correct some sentences and formulations. Examples may include:\n - poor sentence formulation: \"If the edge is empty or a reaction edge, the length is set to 0.\"\n - \"...**a** attention-based aggregation...\""

From this perspective, I don't see how angular edges are conceptually any different from the concept of additional message passing in approaches with functional groups [1] or pseudoatoms/neural atoms [2].
