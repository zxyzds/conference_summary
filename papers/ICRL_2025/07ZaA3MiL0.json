                "value": "This paper proposes a novel approach to denoising in diffusion models for robot manipulation tasks. The authors suggest replacing the standard noising/denoising process with a Langevin dynamics denoising field based on a signed distance function (SDF). This field serves as a deterministic gradient for denoising, aiming to improve temporal consistency and convergence to the ground truth action. Additionally, the authors introduce an alternative radial loss function to optimize the denoising network. The method is evaluated on RLBench in simulation.\n\nThe paper presents a potentially novel idea by introducing an SDF-based denoising field for diffusion in robot manipulation tasks. However, the clarity of the writing and the consistency of the mathematical formulations require improvement to ensure a thorough understanding of the proposed method. The limited number of trials and the ambiguities surrounding the evaluation metrics raise concerns about the robustness of the results. The authors should address the discrepancies observed in the convergence behavior and provide a more thorough explanation of the method's capabilities and limitations. Addressing the weaknesses and questions identified in this review would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution and impact."

                "value": "1.  The applicability of the proposed method appears limited to 2D robotics tasks with end-effector movements, such as tabletop manipulation. The authors do not demonstrate how this approach can be extended to other types of actuations, such as gripper control.\n2.  The paper seems to present a potential misunderstanding regarding the capabilities of diffusion models. It is suggested that diffusion models may produce the same noisy action for different successful actions. However, diffusion models are capable of learning multimodal action distributions through the denoising process, even in cases of overlapping Gaussians.\n3.  Figure 4 raises questions about the convergence behavior of both the proposed method and the standard diffusion model. In scenarios with multiple successful actions (represented by four red triangles), both methods appear to collapse to a single ground truth action. This behavior contradicts the expectation that these models should be able to learn a multimodal distribution and converge to all valid solutions.\n4.  The paper lacks clarity on why the proposed method (CIDM) converges to only one ground truth action in Figure 4, despite demonstrating the ability to learn a bimodal distribution in Figure 2. It remains unclear why the method does not capture the four-modal distribution evident in the task.\n\nThere are a number of places in the text where the authors could provide clarification.\n\n### Confusing text\n\n1.  Line 83: The statement \"robot manipulation prefers to sample initial actions over the entire action space\" is unclear. It is possible the authors intend to convey that the training data covers the entire action space, but the phrasing is ambiguous and requires clarification.\n2.  Line 175: The phrase \"After eliminating the effects of specific successful action $\\hat{y}$\" is vague. It is unclear what is meant by \"eliminating the effects.\" Specifying the mathematical operation, such as marginalizing out $\\hat{y}$, would improve clarity.\n3.  Figure 3 caption, line 337: The caption could improve significantly. It states that the list of 14 tasks tasks are \"highly representative.\"  Highly representative of what?\n4.  The paper lacks details on the experimental setup, particularly regarding the number of trials and seeds used for evaluation. The authors state that results are based on four trials per task, but it is unclear how many random seeds were used to ensure the reliability of the results.\n5.  The metric \"success probability\" requires further explanation. If it is calculated based on four trials per task, the possible values should be limited to [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]%. However, Table 2 presents values such as 82.7%, suggesting a different calculation method or a larger number of trials.\n6.  Equations 12 and 13 contain an error. The 2-norm $\\|y - \\hat{y}\\|$ cannot be less than a negative number ($c<0$).\n7.  Equations 12, 13, and 14 define the denoising field in a way that seems counterintuitive. The denoising field should be $\\epsilon_x(y) = \\hat{y} - y$ to ensure that a single denoising step, $y + \\epsilon_x(y)$, results in the ground truth action $\\hat{y}$. The gradient should point towards the ground truth, not away from it.\n8.  Line 285: The authors claim to be learning a denoising field independent of $\\hat{y}$. However, the training data includes $\\hat{y}$, suggesting that the model likely learns $\\hat{y}$ implicitly. This statement requires clarification or justification.\n9.  Table 1 caption: The caption states that underlined text indicates \"suboptimal performance for each column,\". Does this mean the second-best performance or some other criterion? Additionally, not every column has an underlined number.\n\nThe paper could benefit from additional explanations and clarifications to enhance the reader's understanding of the proposed method. \n<!-- The authors could have utilized the extra to address some of the ambiguities and provide more detailed insights. -->\n\n## Minor Typos\n\n1.  Line 15: \"CIDM\" is used before its introduction in line 144.\n2.  Line 77: \"noises supervision signals\" should be \"noise supervision signals.\"\n3.  Line 93: \"Additionally, We\" should be \"Additionally, we.\"\n4.  Equation 1, line 161: If referring to the DDPM scheduler, the term inside the square root should be $(1 - \\bar{\\alpha_t})$, not $(1 - \\bar{\\alpha_t^2})$.\n5.  Line 28: The statement \"Robot manipulation mainly involves two steps, acquiring effective scene representation and predicting correct actions\" oversimplifies the complexity of robot manipulation, which also involves elements of execution on hardware and reactive control."

This gap makes it challenging to assess the robustness and scalability of the loss. Providing a more detailed theoretical analysis or justifying it with additional related work on spatial consistency in generative models could clarify its effectiveness.\n\n- The current evaluation focuses on RLBench, but it would significantly benefit from testing in other robotic benchmarks or real-world scenarios to assess generalization capabilities. Evaluating CIDM's performance across tasks with varying levels of action complexity, such as multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments, would enhance the robustness claims.\n\n- Temporal consistency is claimed to improve denoising stability across timesteps, but the scalability of this approach remains uncertain for long-duration tasks. Additional evaluations on tasks requiring extended sequences of actions (beyond 100 timesteps) could illustrate CIDM\u2019s scalability and stability in prolonged scenarios.\n\n[1] Liu, X., Gong, C., & Liu, Q.

For example, \u201cInversion by Direct Iteration (Delbracio & Milanfar, 2023) pursues a simpler form to get rid of the limitations of traditional diffusion.\u201d this sentence is confusing because it is not clear to me what things the paper tries to simplify and what limitations they are getting rid of.  Another issue is that the paper mentions that the recent work in diffusion models try to speed up the denoising process and provide in-depth analysis of diffusion models. However, these are not directly related to the inconsistency problem this paper tries to solve. Therefore, I think the paper should reorganize this section so that the connection and difference between related work and the proposed method is more clear. \n2. The main advantage of the proposed method as mentioned by the paper is consistent supervision from multiple successful actions (i.e., multi-modality). However, RL Bench demonstrations is not a demonstration dataset that has obvious multi-modality. A recent paper has proposed a dataset benchmark[1] for evaluation of multi-modal behaviors. It would be interesting to see how the proposed methods and the baselines behave in this benchmark\n3. The proposed method\u2019s improvement over previous methods on Multi-view is not very significant with 82.3% average success rate compared to RVT2\u2019s 81.4%. For each task, the proposed method has the highest success rate only in 7 out of 16 tasks. Therefore, it seems that the performance improvement is limited.  \n4.

It would be interesting to see more qualitative rollouts of other tasks. The paper mentions the method is good for the tasks that has multiple success actions.

In this proposed denoising field and radial loss function, distant GT actions have less influence than closer ones.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### **Weakness 1. Lacking Probabilistic Justification**\n\nThe authors argue that the score function of conventional diffusion models being zero at local minima is **biased** and should instead always point toward the nearest target. They state:\n>\n> \"The first problem is that the score function $\\nabla_{y_t} \\log p_{t} (y_t)$ is biased as a denoising field... Since the reasonable denoising field always makes noisy action closer to its target successful\naction...\"\n> \nHowever, this claim is debatable. I would contend that CIDM itself introduces bias while conventional diffusion models are unbiased. For a model to be unbiased, the denoising field should be almost zero near saddle points, as there\u2019s no justification for favoring one specific target. In conventional diffusion models, added noise serves to break such ties. Conversely, CIDM imposes a strong preference toward nearby targets among multiple possible answers, making the output highly sensitive to the initial conditions of the denoising process. This arbitrary choice of denoising field introduces bias in CIDM, unless the distribution of initial points is meticulously selected (as in flow-matching models). Alternatively, one could adopt the Annealed Langevin MCMC viewpoint proposed by Song & Ermon (2019). In this case, however, one should carefully choose the form of noise and denoising target so as to guarantee the learned to model to be unbiased. These considerations are not thoroughly addressed in the paper. Consequently, there's no assurance that the samples $y$, generated by CIDM, follow the actual target policy $y\\sim p_{data}(y|x)$. \n\n### **Weakness 2. Claimed Benefit not Well-supported**\nAs discussed in Weakness 1, CIDM introduces bias. However, as demonstrated by the Cold Diffusion paper, neural networks can still produce reasonable samples across various corruption processes, even if biased. Thus, bias isn\u2019t necessarily detrimental when a meaningful trade-off is achieved. However, for CIDM, the specific benefits of this trade-off remain unclear.\n\nFirstly, it is questionable whether the issue presented in Figure 4 is due to inconsistent training objectives. Rather, it could be due to the inference-time denoising scheduler. For instance, I observe that increasing the number of denoising iterations or lowering the temperature at smaller noise scales often resolves the underconvergence issue shown in Figure 4. Better denoising strategies, such as DDIM, could also be an option.\n\nSecondly, the authors argue that conventional denoising target is difficult to learn, and suggest that CIDM alleviates this issue by using a more consistent target. However, I\u2019m not convinced that inconsistency is the only factor at play here. The primary issue could instead be the precision of the action. Diffusion models often struggle with generating highly precise actions due to their inherently noisy and complicated denoising pipeline. In contrast, models specifically optimized for precision, like RVT2, outperform CIDM and 3D Diffuser Actor in precision tasks such as block stacking as suggested in the experimental result. If the authors argue that inconsistent denoising targets hinder learning, they should provide evidence that biasing the target with a more consistent approach indeed reduces learning variance, i.e., by showing that CIDM demonstrates improved data efficiency or lower performance variance across different seeds.\n\n### **Weakness 3. Insignificant Result**\nThe experimental results are not significant, as only 25 test episodes were conducted per task. For the 18 tasks in the PerAct setting, this amounts to 450 trials. With CIDM achieving an 82.3% success rate, the 90% confidence interval is 0.78991 \u2264 p \u2264 0.85134. Thus, a 1% improvement over state-of-the-art methods like RVT2 and 3D Diffuser Actor does not offer substantial evidence of CIDM\u2019s superiority.\n\nEven if the reported performance gain holds, it does not sufficiently justify the bias introduced by CIDM. For example, if an expert policy selects a red block with 90% probability and a yellow block with 10%, we would expect the learned policy to favor red blocks proportionally. This expectation does not hold for CIDM. Every generative model has precision-diversity trade-off, and the RLBench success rate primarily measures precision over diversity. Therefore, sacrificing sample diversity for only a 1% performance gain does not make a lot of sense for me."
