    "title": "CaPulse: Detecting Anomalies by Tuning in to the Causal Rhythms of Time Series",
    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, **CaPulse**, which *tunes in* to the underlying *causal pulse* of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.",

                "value": "This paper proposes an anomaly detection framework that combines several existing algorithmic building blocks, including normalized flows, FFTs, and patch-based masking. The overall objective is to maximize the log-likelihood, which appears to produce a latent representation attributed to causal factors."

                "value": "It seems that the learning problem could benefit from a clearer explanation. The objective function appears to be conditioned by $ C_\\text{ind} $ and $C_0$, but the criteria for selecting these values are not immediately obvious. This aspect is essential, especially when considering unsupervised learning tasks with latent variables. It is possible that a two-stage optimization strategy, where $C$ parameters and other model parameters are optimized in an alternating fashion, has been implemented, though a detailed description of this approach does not seem to be readily available. At the very least, it would be helpful if the parameters to be learned were clearly specified.\n\nIn my attempt to understand the algorithm\u2019s operation and the rationale behind its design choices, I encountered a few challenging aspects. These include, for example, the use of FFT in Eq. (1), the orthogonality condition on $ C_\\text{ind} $ and its connection to causal learning, and the role of the \"pyramid\" structure, which may be intended for multi-scale convolution across spatial and temporal dimensions. There are various possible approaches for identifying independent causal factors or periodic patterns at different granularities. In general, a well-written paper typically provides some technical rationale when selecting a specific approach. At present, there appears to be a slight disconnect between the authors\u2019 intended objectives and the selected algorithmic components. For instance, it remains somewhat unclear why the resulting subspaces would lend themselves to causal interpretation or how the noise injection approach contributes to distinguishing confounders.\n\nGiven these considerations, I find it somewhat challenging to fully assess the framework\u2019s novelty at this stage. I am inclined to suggest that additional development and clarification may be beneficial for the paper to reach its full potential for publication."
