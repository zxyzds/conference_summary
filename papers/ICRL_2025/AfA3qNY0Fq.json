    "title": "How Do We Select Right LLM for Each Query?",
    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to expand in both variety and cost, selecting the most appropriate model for each query is becoming increasingly crucial. Many existing works treat this as an offline problem, necessitating a data-gathering phase to compile a set of query-answer-reward triplets beforehand. They often struggle to determine the adequate number of triplets needed and are prone to overfitting if the data volume is insufficient. To address these limitations, we propose a new solution, the Multi-Armed Router (MAR), which applies multi-armed bandit theory\u2014a perspective previously unexplored in this domain. Unlike previous works that base decision-making solely on regression techniques using static datasets (i.e., constructed triplets), our method treats this as an online multi-LLM recommendation problem, which better mirrors real-world applications. Moreover, rather than the vanilla multi-armed bandit, our framework employs contextual bandit algorithms to navigate the trade-offs between exploring new models and exploiting proven models, while considering the dependency between the input query and the answer's reward. Due to the lack of an off-the-shelf dataset in this area, we construct WildArena, a dataset of 4,029 real-world user queries. For each query, there are seven open-ended responses derived from seven leading LLMs, respectively, with an evaluation score for each answer by using the LLM-as-a-Judge framework. We hope that the introduction of the new perspective and the dataset will facilitate the research in per-query LLM routing.",

Have you looked at the statistics of the ratings from the judge LLM and made sure they are normalized and not suffered from positional bias etc. \n- The algorithm is presented poorly. In Line 10, if the output from an LLM is evaluated by another LLM, why is it that in the reward r= g(s,c), s is a function of the embedding of the query, but not the query itself?

Even for the same model, responses to the same query can vary significantly (due to top-p sampling), leading to large fluctuations in reward scores. This raises a critical issue: how can the routing be reliably performed based solely on the query? Without accounting for the inherent variability in responses, the model\u2019s routing decisions may lack consistency and reliability, potentially misguiding the selection of the most suitable LLM.\n3.In the dataset construction process, the authors manually reduced GPT-4's scores by 0.06, which seems overly arbitrary and lacks sufficient justification. This manual adjustment introduces a bias into the evaluation process and may not accurately reflect the true performance differences between models, potentially skewing the results and limiting the generalizability of the findings."

In some scenario, the priority is not on cost-effectiveness but solely on selecting the best-performing LLM.

                "value": "Although the paper shows an interesting way to formulate the problem of choosing the right LLM for a given query, I have some concerns regarding the motivation, soundness, and presentation of the work:\n\n[W1] **Clarity in the motivation.** It would benefit the paper to explicitly mention (in the introduction) the downstream use-case of their method in order to properly motivate the approach and the experiments. Is this LLM query optimization designed for (a) users querying an LLM on a daily basis? (b) For collecting data for instruction finetuning? (c) Or for collecting preference data (d) others?\n\n- [W1.1] I also don\u2019t entirely agree with the lack of data that necessitates creating WildArena. Again, this might be due to the lack of clarity in the motivation that\u2019s why I\u2019m still having trouble contextualizing the dataset. For example, [Ultrafeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback) has a similar set-up: different models with different ratings based on different aspects.\n\n[W2] **Soundness of the experiments.** I have concerns on the robustness and reliability of the claims (soundness) based on the current experiments. For example:\n\n- [W2.1] There are claims of cost-efficiency and practicality of the router, but I\u2019m not entirely convinced because: (1) setting-up 7B and 32B models (as in their experiments) also incurs some running GPU costs and (2) recent improvements in API-based LLMs like OpenAI GPT-4\u2019s Batch Inference has significantly reduced query costs. I suggest performing actual cost estimates (aside from cumulative regret) to strengthen this argument.\n- [W2.2] Figure 4 shows that GPT-3.5 is almost on par with their approach in terms of performance. In practice, my opinion is that it's easier to set up an inference pipeline for a single model than having a committee of models just to get a 1% performance improvement (happy to be corrected). I suggest showing why it is still worth it to set-up a MAR framework and in what cases GPT-3.5 fails.\n- [W2.3] The MAR framework uses the scores of an LLM-as-a-judge from WildArena as a target. However, experiments showing the validity of these scores are lacking. How do these correspond to human evaluation? What does it mean for a routing framework to perform well on WildArena?\n- [W2.4] Section 4.2 Line 373 mentions that the MAR framework reaches the ideal scenario after 200 steps. How sensitive is this number on WildArena? I suggest strengthening this argument and show that this suboptimal regime is still small for different types of datasets. \n\n[W3] **Nits: minor writing issues in the manuscript.** There are a few grammatical errors that need to be addressed in the manuscript. For example, the title might need to have an article \u201cHow do we select **the** right LLM for each query?\u201d I\u2019ve also noticed single-quotation marks incorrectly used when enclosing the text or usage of `\\citep` instead of `\\citet` or `\\citealt` that breaks the flow of reading. These are minor nits and I encourage the authors to revisit the manuscript to update."
