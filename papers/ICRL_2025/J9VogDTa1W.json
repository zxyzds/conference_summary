    "title": "Systems with Switching Causal Relations: A Meta-Causal Perspective",
    "abstract": "Most works on causality in machine learning assume that causal relationships are governed by a constant underlying process. However, the flexibility of agents' actions or tipping point behavior in the environmental process can change the qualitative dynamics of the system. As a result, new causal relationships may emerge, while existing ones change or disappear, resulting in an altered causal graph. To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the concept of *meta-causal states*, which groups classical causal models into clusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific mechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be inferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for disentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis toward the application of a dynamical system, demonstrating that meta-causal states can also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a context-dependent framework in which mechanisms emerge merely as a result of external factors.",

The concepts in those papers are somewhat different, but closely related to the topic of this paper.\n\nThe paper should note that some meta-causal states can actually be represented by ordinary SCMs. For example, in an SCM in which Z is caused by both X and Y, it is entirely possible for Y to control *the manner in which* X affects Z. In the simplest case, Y could be a binary variable that determines the functional form of how X affects Z. This complicates the structural equation of Z, but it\u2019s not outside of the standard definition of SCMs. Of course, this approach has limitations. For example, it cannot be used to reverse the direction of causation between two other variables (at least not within the standard definition of SCMs). However, it can toggle the existence of an edge or change the manner in which one or more parent variables affects their child. This should be noted more clearly in the discussion.\n\nThe utility of meta-causal states is not immediately evident. That is, what sorts of practical causal inference in medicine, economics, social science, or other domains would be improved by consideration of meta-causal states? What errors are made now using conventional causal modeling that would be avoided by the use of meta-causal states? I suspect that there are good answers to these questions, but it would improve the paper if they were more clearly explained.\n\n**References**\n\nMinka, T., & Winn, J. (2008).

                "value": "- The core concept of the paper seems to be multiply defined. I understand \"meta-causal\" to refer to questions of what *caused* the structural equations to be what they are (as in line 044-045). But in other places in the paper, it seems to refer to an abstraction where we don't look at the precise structural equations but instead at some qualitative characteristics. E.g. in the dynamical system of stress-induced fatigue in section 4.3, the structural equations remain the same but it is emphasized that there are are different causal states (e.g. self-reinforcing or self-suppressing). It is presented as a major premise of the paper (final sentence of abstract) that meta-causal states do not always result from external influences. But according to the first definition, there is only one meta-causal state, because the structural equations don't change, so this is not an example of meta-causality. (As a consequence of this ambiguity of \"meta-causality\" in the paper, I find it hard to assess to what extent the emprical results support the claims of the paper.)\n- I found the start of section 3 to be rather hard to follow, due to its density and it being unclear what intuition is being formalized. There is no overall description of how SCM and mediation process make up a more complex new process. The transition function seems to imply a dynamical view, with discrete time steps. But it is not made explicit anywhere that variables should be thought of as having a time index (should they?). In definition 1, the presence of the transition function does suggest that transitions between time steps are always happening."

Are they?\n- In definition 1, line 141, in what way does an element of  $\\mathcal{X}_j^{S}$ represent a \"change\" of $\\mathcal{X}_j$?\n- An odd point I wanted to note: if an SCM has arrows $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to Z$, the meta-causal state would also have an arrow for the indirect effect $X \\to Z$. So these arrows aren't structural, merely descriptive. It depend on the answer to my question about $\\mathbf{X}$ above whether this is a drawback or merely remarkable.\n- Line 171 \"As standard causal relations emerge from the underlying mediation process\": How do they emerge? Is this always true?"

Although I am not that familiar with related work in this domain, I would have expected some more discussions with work introducing alternative ways to formalize causality, such as:\n- \"A Measure-Theoretic Axiomatisation of Causality\" by Park et al.\n- \"Phenomenological Causality\" by Janzing et al.\n\nThese works go in a different direction but seem, on a high level, related.\n\nThe introduction is very hard to follow and could be motivated better. While the example in Figure 1 is definitely helpful to understand the idea and limitations, the introduction often sounds too abstract. Maybe starting with the Figure 1 (a) example on a high-level description without further introduction of any formalisms around causal modeling could be helpful for the motivation.\n\nWhile the practical application in a general setting seems to be limited in the current form, the authors fairly discuss the current limitations and the work still provides a valuable foundation for follow-up work.\n\nWhen the authors can comment on the lack of theoretical statements (e.g., theorems ensuring that, under certain conditions, one can transform a MCM to a classical SCM), I am willing to further increase the score."
