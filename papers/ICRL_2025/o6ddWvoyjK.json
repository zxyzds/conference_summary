    "title": "BrainCodec: Neural fMRI codec for the decoding of cognitive brain states",
    "abstract": "Recently, leveraging big data in deep learning has led to significant performance improvements, as confirmed in applications like mental state decoding using fMRI data. \nHowever, fMRI datasets remain relatively small in scale, and the inherent issue of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in fMRI data further exacerbates these challenges. \nTo address this, we apply compression techniques as a preprocessing step for fMRI data. \nWe propose BrainCodec, a novel fMRI codec inspired by the neural audio codec. \nWe evaluated BrainCodec's compression capability in mental state decoding, demonstrating further improvements over previous methods.\nFurthermore, we analyzed the latent representations obtained through BrainCodec, elucidating the similarities and differences between task and resting state fMRI, highlighting the interpretability of BrainCodec. \nAdditionally, we demonstrated that fMRI reconstructions using BrainCodec can enhance the visibility of brain activity by achieving higher SNR, suggesting its potential as a novel denoising method. \nOur study shows that BrainCodec not only enhances performance over previous methods but also offers new analytical possibilities for neuroscience.\nOur codes, dataset, and model weights are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BrainCodec.",

Additionally, reconstructing fMRI data does not provide comparable insights to those offered by fMRI analytics and diagnostics.\n\n3).

            "questions": {
                "value": "The following 6 questions correspond to Weaknesses.\n\n1). Individual Application: Since fMRI provides valuable insights into functional impairments faster than structural imaging, an effective pipeline for individual fMRI signal analysis and decoding would be highly beneficial. The authors appear to have developed a novel framework similar to AOE, which typically requires a large dataset for training, even in unsupervised learning settings. However, the authors do not discuss the applicability of their framework to individual fMRI data. If it cannot be applied on a personal level, the framework\u2019s clinical translational potential may be limited.\n\n2). The Concept of Codebooks: The authors applied their framework to both resting-state and task-based fMRI to establish a codebook explaining neural activity. However, they provide only qualitative explanations and visualizations. Reviewers suggest that the authors could strengthen the connection between the codebook and established fMRI components, such as Brain Connectivity Networks (BCNs) or specific task paradigms. The reviewers would like to see the codebook serve as an alternative technique for representing brain activity. For example, task-codebooks could be compared with task paradigms and be linked with spatial features, like BCNs, to clarify their role in fMRI analytics. Importantly, reviewers are particularly interested in understanding whether codebooks could contribute to early diagnostics for neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Meanwhile, the codebook concept should be introduced and contextualized in the introduction section.\n\n3). Hyperparameter Tuning: It appears that essential hyperparameters in this work were determined manually. Reviewers are concerned that some hyperparameters, such as the number of artificial neurons, could significantly impact the Braincodes's outcomes. A detailed description of the hyperparameter tuning process would enhance transparency and reproducibility.\n\n4). Optimization: The authors presented a complex model but did not provide sufficient details about the optimization approach used in this work. Reviewers would like clarification on the choice of advanced gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam, STORM, or SGD), along with specifics on the learning rate and other vital parameters.\n\n5). Datasets: The authors did not include detailed demographic information on the datasets used in their experiments. Reviewers recommend providing specifics on the number of subjects, as well as age and gender distributions.\n\n6). Empirical Experimentation: Reviewers found the experimental design somewhat confusing. In section 4.2.1, the authors report codebooks from resting-state fMRI, yet multiple task-based codebooks are mentioned within this section. Reviewers suggest that results from resting-state and task-based fMRI should be reported separately, as these data types are distinct. Additionally, the authors only compare the reconstructed fMRI data using BrainCodec with BrainVAE. Including comparisons with other representative linear learning methods, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL), would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of BrainCodec\u2019s time efficiency and reconstruction accuracy."
