    "abstract": "Precision medicine, such as patient-adaptive treatments utilizing medical images, poses new challenges for image segmentation algorithms due to (1) the large variability across different patients and (2) the limited availability of annotated data for each patient. In this work, we propose a data-efficient segmentation method to address these challenges, namely $\\textit{\\textbf{P}art-aware}$ $\\textit{\\textbf{P}ersonalized}$ $\\textit{\\textbf{S}egment}$ $\\textit{\\textbf{A}nything}$ $\\textit{\\textbf{M}odel}$ ($\\mathbf{{P}^{2}SAM}$). Without any model fine-tuning, enables seamless adaptation to any new patients relying only on one-shot patient-specific data. We introduce a novel part-aware prompt mechanism to select multiple-point prompts based on part-level features of the one-shot data, which can be extensively integrated into different promptable segmentation models, such as SAM and SAM 2. To further promote the robustness of the selected part-aware prompt, we propose a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach to determine the optimal number of part-level features for a specific case. $\\text{P}^{\\text{2}}\\text{SAM}$ improves the performance by $\\texttt{+} 8.0$% and $\\texttt{+} 2.0$% mean Dice score within two patient-specific segmentation tasks, and exhibits impressive generality across different domains, $\\textit{e.g.}$, $\\texttt{+} 6.4$% mIoU on the PerSeg benchmark. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

                "value": "The article addresses challenges in personalized treatment within modern precision medicine, particularly in the context of medical image segmentation. The key issues it aims to solve include:\n\n1.\tPatient Variability: There is considerable variability among different patients, which complicates the segmentation of tumors and critical organs in medical images.\n2.\tLimited Annotated Data: Many existing segmentation algorithms rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, personalized treatment often encounters a shortage of such data for individual patients, making it difficult to train models effectively.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a new approach formulated as an in-context segmentation problem, leveraging the promptable segmentation mechanism of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Their method, named P2SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), allows for seamless adaptation to new, out-of-distribution patients using only one-shot patient-specific data."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Representation: The overall logic of the paper appears problematic to me. The title and introduction emphasize \"Precision Medicine,\" yet the writing primarily focuses on highlighting the general applicability of the proposed method. Numerous examples and results are presented from the natural image domain, while the content related to \"Precision Medicine\" is notably limited, which may cause confusion for readers.\n\n2. The motivation for the \"Part-aware Prompt Mechanism\" is unclear: what is the reasoning behind this approach, and how does it address challenges in medical tasks? The architecture diagram is also based on natural image applications, leaving it unclear how the proposed method tackles issues specific to precision medicine. Additionally, there is no discussion on how this approach handles different modalities in medical imaging, which the paper should address.\n\n3. Method: Several aspects require further clarification and enhancement. \n\n     a. Firstly, the decision to use only a single negative point per cluster raises concerns regarding its sufficiency. A more robust approach would involve utilizing multiple negative points to enhance model generalization.\n\n     b. Secondly, while the method is designed for patient-specific segmentation, it raises concerns about its application to multi-segmentation tasks. A discussion on how the part-aware prompt mechanism could adapt to scenarios involving multiple segmentations would improve the methodology's applicability.\n\n     c. Additionally, the manuscript relies on 2D segmentation, which requires numerous points for effective performance. This issue remains unaddressed, and the choice not to utilize native 3D models is not sufficiently justified. Given the advantages of 3D models in capturing spatial relationships and providing more comprehensive context in medical imaging, exploring their potential application in this study would strengthen the methodology.\n\n4. Experiments: Several areas require clarification and enhancement.\n\n     a. Firstly, it is unclear whether the number of clusters set for K-means is consistent across different datasets. A detailed explanation of how the clustering parameters are determined for each dataset would improve the robustness of the results and ensure comparability.\n\n     b. Secondly, the comparison methods lack the inclusion of the latest medical-related benchmarks. Integrating more recent studies or state-of-the-art approaches would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This would help contextualize the results within the current landscape of medical imaging segmentation research.\n\n5. The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Numerous improvements to SAM tailored for medical imaging have been proposed, yet many of them are omitted in this work\u2019s comparative experiments. Furthermore, several segmentation baselines widely used in the medical domain are not referenced, which casts doubt on the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed method."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Is the proposed method truly aimed at addressing \"Precision Medicine,\" as suggested in the title and introduction, or is it intended as a more general approach applicable to both natural image and medical imaging domains? These are fundamentally different focuses, and clarity on this point is essential.\n\n2. What is the motivation behind the proposed method, and how does it address some of the fundamental challenges in the medical imaging field, such as unclear lesion boundaries and significant variations across different imaging modalities? Clarity on how these issues are tackled is crucial.\n\n3. Since the method claims to address patient-specific segmentation, it must consider the significant variability in characteristics across different diseases, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and rectal cancer. How does the proposed method ensure effectiveness when dealing with patients suffering from various diseases with distinct features?"

The contribution on the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism is unclear. Although the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the overall method, it is unclear if the improvements are from the part-based sampling strategy or merely because of having multiple prompts.\n3.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism, could the author compared to a modified version of PerSAM where instead of selecting \"two points with the highest and lowest confidence values\", the authors may select the top K and bot K' points where K and K' matches P^2SAM. In this way, the authors can demonstrate that points found by the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism are more effective. \n2. Since authors have shown better one-shot segmentation performance, I am curious to see if the authors can show their method's performance beyond patients with multi-exams. For example, for some medical segmentation datasets without patients with multi-exams, can the author randomly select one image-mask pair as the prior and test the model's performance on other pairs."
