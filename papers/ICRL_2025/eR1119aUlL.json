    "title": "Dynamical modeling for real-time inference of nonlinear latent factors in multiscale neural activity",
    "abstract": "Continuous real-time decoding of target variables from time-series data is needed for many applications across various domains including neuroscience. Further, these variables can be encoded across multiple time-series modalities such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials that can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps.  Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not support real-time decoding and do not address the different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Here, we develop a learning framework that can nonlinearly aggregate information across multiple time-series modalities with such distinct characteristics, while also enabling real-time decoding. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly fuses information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples,  2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. We further introduce smoothness regularization objectives on the learned dynamics to better decode smooth target variables such as behavioral variables and employ a dropout technique to increase the robustness for missing samples. We show that our model can aggregate information across modalities to improve target variable decoding in simulations and in a real multiscale brain dataset. Further, our method outperforms prior linear and nonlinear multimodal models.",

                "value": "This paper presents MRINE, a nonlinear dynamical modeling framework for multiscale neural activity that enables real-time information aggregation across modalities with different timescales and/or missing samples. MRINE consists of a multiscale encoder that fuses modalities after learning within-modality dynamics, a multiscale dynamical backbone for extracting multimodal temporal dynamics and enabling real-time decoding, and modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions. The authors also introduce smoothness regularization objectives and a time-dropout technique to improve robustness to missing samples. Through simulations and application to a real multiscale brain dataset, MRINE is shown to outperform prior linear and nonlinear multimodal models in fusing information across modalities to improve decoding, even with different timescales or missing samples, making it valuable for real-time neurotechnology applications."

In other words, the improvement in decoding accuracy alone doesn\u2019t convincingly justify the introduction of different timescales and handling of missing samples, as I think baseline accuracy could potentially be enhanced through additional parameters or optimized training settings, such as changing the factor dimension in LFADS."

The contribution of this model is claimed to generalize the latent variable models to multi-timescales, multi-probabilistic distributions, and allow missing samples across modalities. The model can work on discrete Poisson spiking activity and Gaussian local field potentials (LFPs). The evaluation is worked on simulated and real-world neural datasets, which show performance gain in subject behavior decoding and latent dynamics reconstruction."

                "value": "- **Poor coverage of the literature**: Despite the discussion of the literature in the paper and comparisons to different models, I find the coverage of the literature to be at a very surface level. There was much work that was not cited in the paper that should be included to accurately show the status of the field now.  For example [2,3] are multi-modal models and [1] despite not being multimodal can handle missing data. As it is now, the paper doesn\u2019t do justice to all the other models that can handle multi-modal data and thus draws an inaccurate/incomplete picture of multi-modal work in neuroscience. To improve this, I suggest incorporating the citations below to the \u2018Multimodal Models in Neuroscience\u2019 section in the paper as well as the introduction.\n- **Comparisons**: Despite comparing the model to several different ones, I am not sure why it was not compared to some of the novel multimodal neuroscience models [2,3]. I understand there are already 5 comparisons but adding a comparison with more current models like the ones previously stated can be more refreshing, and useful,  and show how MRINE compares to more current models. \n- **Limited experiments**: The application of the model was limited, I wanted a demonstration with at least 1 more real experimental data to really make the model stand out and show its utility. Without validation on multiple real-world neuroscience datasets, it is challenging to assess whether MRINE\u2019s claims generalize across different settings. \n\n\n**References**\n1.
