    "title": "InsBank: Evolving Instruction Subset for Ongoing Alignment",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) typically undergo instruction fine-tuning to improve alignment. Recent research highlights that the quality and diversity of instruction data are more critical than data quantity, prompting the selection of diverse, high-quality instruction subsets to reduce training costs. However, how to evolve these selected subsets alongside the development of new instruction data remains insufficiently explored. To achieve LLMs' ongoing alignment, we introduce Instruction Bank (InsBank), a continuously updated repository that integrates the latest valuable instructional data. We further propose Progressive Instruction Bank Evolution (PIBE), a novel framework designed to evolve InsBank effectively and efficiently over time. It firstly employs a gradual data selection strategy to maintain long-term efficiency, utilizing a representation-based diversity score that captures relationships between data points and retains historical information for comprehensive diversity evaluation. This also allows for flexible combination of diversity and quality scores during data selection and ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIBE significantly outperforms baseline methods in evolving InsBank. Additionally, PIBE enables users to flexibly extract smaller subsets based on their specific budget.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of selecting a diverse and high-quality instruction subset to enhance efficiency in instruction tuning. To achieve this, the authors score data points based on diversity and quality, using an affinity-propagation-based function for diversity scoring. In experiments, they evaluated their method, PIBE, against three baseline methods on two benchmark datasets.\nThe reviewer primarily has the following concerns regarding the significance of the problem, the problem formulation, the contribution, the presentation, and the experiments.\n\n**Significance of the problem** \n\nTo the reviewer, the importance of selecting a subset of data for instruction tuning is not clear. From an efficiency perspective, considering the substantial data size involved in pre-training, the reviewer does not consider the instruction data size as a primary bottleneck hindering the development of foundation models. From a performance perspective, the authors did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate the benefits of data selection.\n\n**Problem formulation**\n\nAs highlighted in numerous recent publications [1,2,3], instruction tuning is extensively used, in addition to alignment, to adapt LLMs for specific domains or tasks. For this reason, it would be critical to incorporate domain or task information into the data selection process, rather than using a task-agnostic approach as in the developed method.\n\n**Contribution**\n\nThe contribution of this work is unclear. The challenges addressed don\u2019t appear to be significant, as the main improvement seems to be an advanced clustering method over KNN for diversity measurement. This may be incremental and insufficient for a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\n**Presentation**\n\nThe presentation could be significantly improved. The motivations behind several key design choices are unclear. For instance, the advantages of affinity propagation over KNN for measuring data diversity are not clear. Additionally, the correlation between diversity measurement and model performance on downstream tasks is unclear. The rationale for calculating the representation score as in Eqn. 8 also needs clarification. Lastly, in Eqn. 4, please correct the font type for X and B on the right-hand side.\n\n**Experiments**\n\nIn the experiments, the authors evaluate only three baseline methods and two benchmark datasets. Compared to similar studies in ICLR, the experimental setup lacks comprehensiveness. Additionally, it would strengthen the work if the authors reported the percentage of data selected and provided a comparison between using all data versus only the selected data, to better validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is also recommended that the authors demonstrate that their method enhances the diversity of the selected data and that the performance gains are primarily due to this diversity improvement.\n\n[1] LlaSMol: Advancing Large Language Models for Chemistry with a Large-Scale, Comprehensive, High-Quality Instruction Tuning Dataset \n\n[2] EcomGPT: Instruction-tuning Large Language Models with Chain-of-Task Tasks for E-commerce\n\n[3] MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning"
