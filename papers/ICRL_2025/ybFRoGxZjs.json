    "abstract": "Thermography is especially valuable for the military and other users of surveillance cameras. Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality.\nBesides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90\\%. The code and dataset will be released.",

In fact, the authors present and evaluate three different strategies to incorporate thermal images into 3DGS: MFTG (based on fine-tuning), MSMG (leverages multi-task learning), and OMMG\u2014the latter yields a single Gaussian, which is achieved by extending 3DGS with spherical harmonics to represent thermal data. Moreover, a regularization term is proposed that accounts for the smooth nature of thermal images, and a new weight scheduling strategy prevents the proposed MSMG from overfitting to a single modality. Based on a newly collected RGB+thermal dataset consisting of ten scenes, the authors could successfully show that their method outperforms 3DGS baselines and a recent NeRF-based method in terms of RGB and thermal rendering quality while requiring less memory."

Experiments are well described and cared out thoroughly. The ablation study nicely supports all design decisions. All in all,  I don\u2019t see any obvious flaws.\n\n- This is (to the best of my knowledge) the first paper to use some kind of scheduling to dynamically adjust the weight that balances the RGB and thermal loss in Eq. (12). The proposed strategy seems plausible to me, and, according to the experimental evaluation, significantly reduces the memory footprint while only slightly decreasing image quality. Due to the reduced number of Gaussians, this strategy also increases rendering speed.\n\n- Compared to prior work [1,3] (but similar to [5]), the method presented in this work is actually capable of *improving* the RGB rendering quality, especially in low-light conditions.\n\n- The paper proposes and evaluates not only a single method but three different strategies to incorporate thermal images into 3DGS, thus can be seen as the 3DGS-based pendant to [1].\n\n- I appreciate the newly collected dataset. Although small-scaled (like all other publicly available RGB+thermal datasets), it is diverse, contains forward-facing and 360-degree scenes, and encompasses indoor and outdoor environments. This is very helpful to the community.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Mert \u00d6zer et al. Exploring Multi-modal Neural Scene Representations With Applications on Thermal Imaging.

                "value": "- I am missing citations (and discussions) of recent related works [1,2,5] in the introduction and related work sections.\n\n- I would love to see empirical evidence for the statement in L337: \"we observe that the weight coefficients of a modality align linearly with the Gaussian it ultimately generates\". This is a quite interesting finding that would be much better supported with data.\n\n- Authors claim multiple times (for example in L028, L104, and L536) that they are the first to use 3DGS to model RGB and thermal images. This statement is actually not true and should be revised. The authors of [5] already presented a 3DGS-based method that incorporates RGB and thermal data (see Section 4.5 of the main paper and Section 4 of supplementary).\n\n- In Table 1, the following open-source multi-view RGB+thermal datasets are missing: ThermalMix proposed in [1], the datasets presented in [2], and MVTV proposed in [5]. Why is the proposed dataset better than these datasets? Also, it would be good to provide specific criteria for how multi-view consistency and content richness is evaluated across datasets. This would help clarify the comparison and justify any claims about the proposed dataset's advantages.\n\n- With the high number of recently published RGB+thermal datasets, I think it might make sense to evaluate the introduced method on at least one of these datasets, also to mitigate potential dataset bias. \n\n- In addition, the proposed method could be compared to some more of the recently published NeRF-based methods. There is code available for [2].\n\n- In L097 authors mention that ThermoNeRF [3] reduces RGB rendering quality, while the proposed method improves it (according to Table 3, an average increase of almost 5% in PSNR). I think that is a huge plus for the proposed method; however, this argument would be much stronger if authors would add comparisons with NeRF-based methods to Table 3.\n\n- I would love to see a side-by-side comparison of thermal renderings with and without the smoothness term.\n\n- Although the proposed weight scheduling used in MSMG yields lower storage requirements, the average rendering quality for RGB and thermal data is worse than for OMMG (see Tables 2 and 3; difference higher for thermal renderings, drop of about 1% in PSNR). So, if one wants to maximize rendering quality and therefore uses OMMG, the benefit of having lower memory requirements is gone (see Table 4; OMMG requires about 60% of the storage space of 3DGS in contrast to 8% for MSMG).\n\n- In Section 3.2, three different strategies to obtain camera poses for thermal images are mentioned. What strategy is actually used for the experiments? Also, what strategy performs best? A quantitative comparison would be really helpful, also because MSX seems to perform best (just by looking at Figure 2). The problem I see is that MSX is patented by FLIR, as such it is not available to other cameras. Hence, the practical use of the third strategy is highly limited, and it would be good to know which strategy could be used instead. Do the other strategies in any form make use of MSX images as well?\n\nReferences:\n\nSee above."

(10) set? Also, are these two lambdas the same?\n\n- As far as I understand, MSMG uses the cost function described in Eq. (7), i.e., without multimodal regularization. So, whenever \"Ours_MSMG\" is used in Tables 2 and 3, it refers to MSMG method trained without multimodal regularization. This is in accordance with Table 4, where authors add a dedicated row for \"Ours_MSMG+MR\" which would not be necessary if MSMG uses MR per default (in this case, I would rather expect a row with \"Ours_MSMG w\\o MR\" in Table 4). As this would mean that MR has never been used except in the ablation study, I would guess that per default, Eq. (12) has been used to train MSMG. Please make this more clear (e.g., by replacing Eq. (7) with Eq. (12) and referring to Section 3.4. on how to choose $\\gamma$).\n\n- What cost function is used to train OMMG? Is it Eq. (7)? If so, please move it to the respective paragraph (starting L296).\n\n- In Figures 5 and 6, which strategy does \"Ours\" refer to?\n\n- To be honest, it is quite surprising to me that a conventional chessboard pattern printed on normal paper produces such highly contrasting thermal images. There are numerous works (see, e.g., [6] and references therein) that try to design special calibration objects for thermal cameras. I wonder why all these papers exist when a simple chessboard pattern printed on paper will also work. What are the physical principles behind why a simple chessboard pattern printed on paper works, and how does it compare to more complex calibration objects in terms of accuracy and ease of use?\n\nReferences:\n\n[6] Issac N.
