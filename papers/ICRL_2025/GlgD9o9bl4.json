    "title": "Interpretable and Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Sharing for Biomedical Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "The identification of unobserved links in drug-related biomedical networks is essential for various drug discovery applications, which is also beneficial for both disease diagnosis and treatment through exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms. However, existing solutions face significant challenges due to three main limitations: (1) lack of interpretability to provide comprehensive and reliable insights, (2) insufficient robustness and flexibility in cold-start scenarios, and (3) inadequate interaction and sharing of multi-view information. In light of this, we propose DrugXAS, an interpretable and adaptive cross-view contrastive learning framework with information sharing for biomedical link prediction. Specifically, DrugXAS has three distinctive characteristics for addressing these challenges. To solve the first problem, we propose an attention-aware augmentation scheme to provide understandable explanations of intrinsic mechanisms. To deal with the second challenge, we propose an adaptive graph updater and neighborhood sampler, which select proper neighbors according to the feedbacks from the model to improve aggregation ability. To tackle the third issue, an information sharing module with diffusion loss is proposed to incorporate chemical structures into heterogeneous relational semantics and facilitate the contrast process. Empirically, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets involving multi-type tasks demonstrate that the proposed DrugXAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, robustness, and interpretability. The source code of DrugXAS is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DrugXAS-8EC7.",

This paper introduces a multi-view augmentation scheme, GNN encoder, and graph contrastive learning, which have been widely used in many relevant works [1,2,3,4]. Although DrugXAS proposes an adaptive graph updater and neighborhood sampler to enhance aggregation ability, the work does not seem to provide more substantial technical contributions or novel insights.\n2. Insufficient experiment evaluation. The proposed DrugXAS includes several hyperparameters, such as the weighting coefficients $\\gamma$ in Eq. 13 and the node representations dimension $d$, which require further assess their impact on biomedical link prediction. Moreover, it is important to change different GNN encoders for molecule- and network-view representation learning to verify the model's effectiveness and robustness. \n3. Lack of theoretical analysis. This paper constructs the enhanced graph by selecting the top $k_n$ nodes with the highest cosines similarity for each node, and adaptively updates the graph for better adaptation to cold-start scenarios. However, it is necessary to demonstrate this effectiveness of this strategy, including the selection of $k_n$, via a thorough theoretical analysis. \n\n**Reference**\n[1] MDDI-SCL: predicting multi-type drug-drug interactions via supervised contrastive learning, Journal of Cheminformatics, 2020.\n[2] Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks, nature machine intelligence, 2022.\n[3] DSN-DDI: an accurate and generalized framework for drug-drug interaction prediction by dual-view representation learning, Brief Bioinform, 2023.\n[4] DIG-Mol: A Contrastive Dual-Interaction Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction, Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 2024."

                "value": "1. Section 3 defines the biomedical heterogeneous graph as an undirected graph, yet Figure 1 includes light blue arrows. What do these arrows represent?\n2. Since the proposed DrugXAS has many hyperparameters (e.g., $\\gamma$, $k_n$, $s_n$,and $p_0$), it is inefficient and impractical to select different hyperparameters tailored to different datasets. Could the authors clarify how they address this issue?\n3. According to the proposed dynamic neighborhood sampling in Section 4.2, the DrugXAS iteratively add its neighbors from 1-hop to higher hop to the neighborhood sequence until the sequence length reaches $s_n$. If the number of neighbors from 1-hop exceeds $s_n$, how do the authors select which neighbors to sample?\n4. Could the authors further provide a comprehensive analysis of the model interpretability on various downstream tasks under both warm and cold-start scenarios, which is valuable for understanding the precision and utility of DrugXAS in healthcare applications?"

                "value": "**1. Computational Efficiency and Scalability**\nThe paper lacks crucial analysis of computational overhead and scalability. \nWhile the model achieves good performance in smaller datasets, it introduces multiple complex components (attention-based augmentation, dynamic neighborhood sampling, information sharing module) without analyzing their computational costs. \n- No runtime comparisons are provided against simpler baselines. \n- The memory requirements for storing attention matrices and neighborhood sequences could be substantial for larger graphs. \n\nSo, the paper should include complexity analysis, memory profiling, and scaling experiments on larger datasets to demonstrate real-world applicability.\nThis is my major concern for the paper. \n\n**2. Constrained Evaluation of Interpretability**\n- The interpretability claim of DrugXAS is primarily based on qualitative results, relying heavily on case studies without systematic evaluations. \n- Most importantly, there is no validation from domain experts to confirm whether the generated explanations are meaningful from a biomedical perspective. \nA structured human evaluation involving pharmacologists or medical researchers would significantly strengthen these claims.\n- Furthermore, it remains contentious whether attention provides a valid explanation [1.2]\n\n**3. Augmentation Strategy Issues**\nThe attention-aware augmentation strategy introduces additional hyperparameters (p0, px) whose selection seems crucial but poorly justified. \nAdditionally, limited analysis of how the augmentation impacts different tasks and dataset types limits our understanding of its broader applicability and potential areas for improvement.\n\n**4. Comparison with Alternative Contrastive Learning Approaches**\nSimilar to the Augmentation Strategy Issues, the paper's contrastive learning component lacks comprehensive comparison with recent advances in the field. \nWhile some baseline methods are included, notable omissions include momentum contrast approaches, multi-view contrastive methods, and hierarchical contrastive learning frameworks. \nThe paper should also explore how different positive/negative sampling strategies affect performance, particularly in the cold-start scenario where negative sampling becomes more challenging.\n\n\n**Minor**\n- What do these grey edges mean in Figure 1 (b)? \n-  Many characters in Figure 2 are hard to recognise. \n\n[1] Attention is not explanation\n\n[2] Is attention explanation? an introduction to the debate"
