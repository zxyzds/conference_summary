    "title": "MarS: a Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model",
    "abstract": "Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's ``paradigm shift'' potential for a variety of financial applications.",

The MaRs design and features (Section 2) are also presented at a high level, with insufficient rigour in the problem definition (Section 2.1) -- which may not be known to a ML audience. It is not clear why, for example, being able to provide a text-based description of the desired market scenario, would guarantee controllability (the definition of controllability on page 2 is fairly vague). Similarly, the assumptions made/ requirements about the user-injected orders are not specified. The language is ambiguous in places, e.g. \"any possible market condition\" (p. 2); \"often using recent real orders\" (p. 3). More technical detail could be included in Section 2.1.2, for self-contained, rigorously specified problem and solution,  and to support the claims made in this section.\n\nIt would help to better define the control signals, and discuss their effectiveness for increasing correlation scores."

                "value": "1. The paper\u2019s reproducibility would benefit from providing additional critical details about the method and implementation.\n\n  - In Section 2.1.1, the authors outline that conditional trading order generation requires several hyperparameters, such as DES_TEXT for general market description and MTCH_R for specifying the matching rule for trading orders. However, the experimental section does not provide configuration details for these hyperparameters in relation to the obtained results.\n  \n  - While the authors provide sufficient detail on order sequence modeling and order batch sequence modeling, the training process for the ensemble model lacks detailed illustration, and further illustration on how the two methods are combined within the ensemble would be beneficial.\n\n  - The authors mention that the LMM is trained on real-world market data; however, they do not provide data processing details. For example, real-world LOB data includes various order types (e.g., stop-loss orders, limit orders, market orders) that may arrive asynchronously in the market, yet the paper does not specify how these orders are mapped to the bid and ask sides as described.\n\n2. More comprehensive evaluations are needed to demonstrate the authenticity of the simulated market. Although the authors include three tests of stylized facts, further testing to show that the framework conforms to additional stylized facts would strengthen its credibility. Please see \"Cont, R. (2001). Empirical properties of asset returns: stylized facts and statistical issues. Quantitative finance, 1(2), 223.\" for details. Ideally,  multiple iterations and providing confidence intervals for the measures are preferred.\n\n3. Some of the experiments are not necessarily good demonstrations about the model strength and their design need to be further improved.\n\n  - In the 4.2 detection experiment, 1) the manipulation seems can be easily identified due to anomaly in the distribution tail without resorting to the simulation 2) the distribution similarity need to be clearly defined and demonstrate it is statistical different from the others 3) the author may want to compare with other anomaly detection algorithms.\n\n  - The factor analysis is not a good application example because 1) it could also performed on real world data. 2) the simulated market may not good representation about the real-world market if only three stylized facts are satisfied.\n\n4. The paper\u2019s clarity would benefit from further improvement. Since order sequence modeling and order-batch modeling are two key innovations, the description of these methods should be included in the main content rather than in the supplementary materials."

If such scenario happens, how the will the framework cope with it?\n\n- In the section 3.3, I am not following why the interaction ability is evaluated using the correlation.

                "value": "(1) Time Interval. \nThe model discussed in this paper simulates market at the minute level, whereas in actual financial markets, transactions can occur at the nanosecond level. There could be challenges in accurately capturing the extreme volatility and rapid decision-making. Specifically, using a closed-source LLM engine might introduce limitations due to rate constraints. In contrast, this paper employs an open-source engine, which necessitates careful consideration of its reasoning and inferential capabilities to ensure it can effectively model the high-speed dynamics of financial markets. Does the MarS model have the design capability and flexibility to increase the level of trading time intervals?\n\n(2) Multi-order book correlation.\nIn the design of large market models, the two primary approaches are the order-sequence model and the order-batch model, which capture temporal correlations and patterns. Additionally, in the conditional generation process, it seems to focus solely on a single order book. Considering that markets consist of multiple order books and each asset is significantly influenced by others as well as the market environment, how can the model effectively capture the correlations between different order books?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "(1) Order-sequence model \nThe order-sequence model uses an autoregressive approach to capture patterns within the order book, aiming to predict subsequent orders. However, the diversity of trading strategies among market participants complicates this task, often making the next order seemingly random and unpredictable. For instance, a momentum trader might buy following a price increase, anticipating continued upward movement based on the persistence of price trends. Conversely, a mean reversion trader sees a price rise as a selling opportunity, expecting prices to normalize back to the mean, counter to the current trend. Could you provide literatures or evidences in your experiments supporting a relationship between orders?\n\n(2) Diffusion model\nIn Figure 1, a diffusion model is introduced. Could you explain the rationale behind this choice and how the diffusion model is utilized in this context?"

However, I have some concerns, particularly regarding reproducibility. I would encourage the authors to make efforts to improve this aspect of their framework.\n\nBelow, I outline my main concerns and questions:\n- Key details needed for reproducibility, such as code or datasets, are missing.\n- Given that this is a conference on representation learning, more discussion on the embedding of orders and the LOB state would be valuable. For instance, are all possible order prices linearly discretized into the range [0, 32)? Are price outliers excluded? does the model use absolute prices or the distance from the midprice?\n- What are the training and simulation times? The latter is particularly crucial for the proposed tasks, as generating a few hours of price paths requires thousands of generated orders.\n- A discussion of limitations is missing. For example, unlike text with a relatively fixed vocabulary, a fixed embedding for orders might reduce adaptability across different markets?\n(see also questions)\n\nMinor:\n- Some essential details should appear in the main paper, such as the dataset used and the authors\u2019 use of a LLAMA2 architecture.\n- In line 40, when the authors briefly discuss existing market simulation models, it would be helpful to include citations. This will guide readers interested in statistical or agent-based models to relevant literature.\n- There is occasional overuse of non-technical terms, such as \u201cgold mine of data,\u201d and some paragraphs (e.g., lines 236 and 240), which are also capitalized. Are these intended as citations?\n- In paragraph 2.1.2, clearer spacing or breaks between components would improve readability.\n- Typo on line 384 (\u201cclassesup\u2026\u201d).\n- The diffusion model in Figure 1 is not explained or discussed."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- What does \"MTCH R\" refer to exactly? It\u2019s not clear how a conditional model should interpret a constraint on the \"feasible space for each order\".\n\n- Is the \"SIMULATED CLEARING HOUSE\" simply an exchange engine simulating a double auction market, or is it something else? It seems to be the latter. \n\n- For the order-batch model, which generates orders at the end of each minute, is this the smallest reaction time of the simulation in response to orders? Or does the model plan a minute ahead (a batch of orders) and then refine (by conditioning) that batch using the Order model? How exactly does the condition in Figure 3 function here?\n\n- In Figure 5a, the market replay appears to be shifted (due to buy orders). Is this intentional? Using the replay series as a control? I suggest showing this experiment with a shaded area over multiple simulations with similar buy and sell orders (similar to Figure 17).\n\n- Why is MarS assumed to have a \"real\" transition distribution P(s | s, a) in Table 1? \n\n- In Section 4.2, the detection approach is interesting, but I\u2019m curious whether the observed difference in distribution similarity (computed how?) is statistically significant. Are stressful trading days or shocks interpreted as manipulation as well? Before claiming this approach is feasible, it would be helpful to see the average difference in spread distribution over multiple days or periods.\n\n- In Figure 19b, the market impact appears to be permanent. Is it true? What happens if we extend the simulation period?\n\n- How does the model adapt to different markets (without re-training)? For example, Chinese markets generally differ significantly from U.S. markets in terms of liquidity and frequency."
