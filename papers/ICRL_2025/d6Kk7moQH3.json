    "abstract": "Data-driven deformable image registration methods predominantly rely on operations that process grid-like inputs.\nHowever, applying deformable transformations to an image results in a warped space that deviates from a rigid grid structure.\nConsequently, data-driven approaches with sequential deformations have to apply grid resampling operations between each deformation step. \nWhile artifacts caused by resampling are negligible in high-resolution images, the resampling of sparse, high-dimensional feature grids introduces errors that affect the deformation modeling process.\nTaking inspiration from Lagrangian reference frames of deformation fields, our work introduces a novel paradigm for data-driven deformable image registration that utilizes geometric deep-learning principles to model deformations without grid requirements.\nSpecifically, we model image features as a set of nodes that freely move in Euclidean space, update their coordinates under graph operations, and dynamically readjust their local neighborhoods.\nWe employ this formulation to construct a multi-resolution deformable registration model, where deformation layers iteratively refine the overall transformation at each resolution without intermediate resampling operations on the feature grids.\nWe investigate our method's ability to fully deformably capture large deformations across a number of medical imaging registration tasks. \nIn particular, we apply our approach (GeoReg) to the registration of inter-subject brain MR images and inhale-exhale lung CT images, showing superior performance to the current state-of-the-art methods.",

The key innovation lies in leveraging a Lagrangian framework, where deformations are applied without relying on grid constraints, which is a fresh approach in medical imaging registration. The model\u2019s design also incorporates a multi-resolution framework, which progressively refines transformations from coarse to fine, reducing the need for intermediate resampling and preserving feature integrity.

It is claimed that this reduces resampling operations by moving into a continuous space for all computations.

                "value": "- In general, I believe that the overall method is novel, but I am not sure that the chosen application scenarios actually showcase any tangible advantages. In my mind, such a Lagrangian frame-based setup makes most sense in a scenario where the input data is sparsely and irregularly sampled. However, this is not the case in the applications tackled in this paper. I would have expected to see something that either only involves shapes or point clouds to be registered or some artificial scenarios where only data at certain patches or key points is available (e.g., to mimic intra-interventional registration problem arising in radiation therapy). Given the presented applications, I fail to see the claimed benefits of the presented methods. However, in the area of such explicitly spare problems prior work on geometric deep learning already exists (e.g., Hansen et al.) as acknowledged by the authors, which then challenges a bit the novelty of this work.\n\n- Additional problems that I see with the conducted experiments are that half of them operate on somewhat simple synthetic deformations and for the real-world scenarios (brain and lung registration) I miss any statistical tests that really back up the claimed improvements over the chosen baselines. While the baselines cover some of the SOTA approaches in DL-based image registration, it would have been nice to see additional specific, relevant baselines for the datasets chosen (e.g., LapIRNv2, which won last year's Learn2Reg challenge on the NLST data with a TRE of less than 1.5 mm). I am also missing traditional approaches such as ANTs as baselines as right now only a FFD/B-spline-based method is included.\n\n- I also find the number of foldings in the real-world results rather high and concerning. Unfortunately this is not really discussed in the paper (or I have not been able to find it) and I would be interested in learning the reasons for this. Is this a result of the mostly implicit regularization employed here that is not strong enough? While I acknowledge that the authors are not explicitly focusing on presenting a diffeomorphic registration framework, this aspect warrants further investigation and improvements and/or a discussion on how this could be achieved.\n\n- The presented method appears to be quite memory hungry, but the paper never makes this explicit. I would have expected to see some numbers here instead of the rather abstract discussion in Sec. 3.2.. Right now, it is not really possible to assess this crucial aspect of the paper."
