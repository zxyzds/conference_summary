    "title": "CATCH: Channel-Aware Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CATCH-E535",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The foundational motivation of the paper needs stronger articulation. The authors primarily focus on the limitations of reconstruction-based methods, specifically their tendency to overlook details in high-frequency bands. However, several studies have already explored leveraging frequency information in MTSAD. The introduction section could benefit from a detailed comparison between current frequency-based methods and the proposed approach. A structured comparison that highlights the specific gaps addressed by CATCH would strengthen the paper\u2019s positioning and clarify its contributions to the field. Consider including a table or a structured comparison in the introduction that clearly outlines how CATCH addresses specific gaps in existing frequency-based MTSAD methods, such as handling high-frequency information, computational efficiency, and the ability to capture channel correlations.\n2. The experimental evaluation would benefit from a broader comparison with relevant frequency-based methods. Although several approaches (e.g., SR-CNN, PFT, TFAD, and Dual-TF) are mentioned, they are notably absent from the experimental comparisons. To enhance this aspect, it would be constructive to include these specific methods in the experimental comparisons and to explain why comparing against these particular approaches is valuable for demonstrating CATCH\u2019s contributions.\n3. The paper\u2019s central claim regarding superior detection of frequency-specific anomalies requires more rigorous theoretical or empirical validation. While the method aims to better capture fine-grained frequency characteristics, there is no dedicated experimental design to verify this capability. To address this, consider adding specific experiments or analyses that can demonstrate superior detection of frequency-specific anomalies. For instance, you could create synthetic datasets with known frequency-specific anomalies or analyze performance across different frequency bands.\n4. The manuscript requires careful editorial revision to address. There are some typos like \u201cresults\u201d in the abstract. Also, some citations should be updated to published versions instead of preprints."

                "value": "1.\tIn line 53, the term \"heterogeneous subsequence anomalies\" is mentioned. Could you provide a specific definition for heterogeneous subsequence anomalies? How do they differ from or relate to regular time series anomalies?\n2.\tIn sections 2.2 and 2.3, in addition to discussing the current state of research, could you include some definitional descriptions? For instance, elaborating on the relationships between channels and frequency domain information in the MTSAD problem could enhance the clarity and structure of the article.\n3.\tIn section 3.1, the description of the framework structure provides technical details, but it lacks a clear explanation of the processes involved. The roles and relationships of the various modules don\u2019t seem to connect well, which affects the logical flow. Adding descriptions of their functions and interrelations could improve the overall coherence.\n4.\tIn lines 230 to 245, where the mathematical principles of the framework are introduced, the abundance of symbols can be overwhelming. It would be clearer if each symbol were introduced upon its first occurrence, or if specific definitions were provided before delving into the mathematical principles and formulas.\n5.\tIn line 369, does the description suggest that contextual and global anomalies are considered as point anomalies in this paper? Similarly, does this apply to the subsequence types in parentheses? It seems that in the field of time series anomaly detection, anomalies are usually classified into various categories without clarifying their hierarchical relationships. This may need further investigation and explanation.\n6.\tIn Figure 5, when examining the temporal scores and frequency domain scores separately, both seem to serve as good anomaly detection metrics. Why does the paper choose to combine these two scores? Are there any examples where the temporal score performs poorly but can be compensated by the frequency domain score (or vice versa)? Such results could better illustrate the effectiveness of this anomaly scoring approach.\n7.\tThere are some typographic faults: The reference in line 185 needs to be enclosed in parentheses; in line 161, there is a spelling error, it should be \"modules\" instead of \"Moudles\"; in line 320, it would be better to align the text and the image on the same page."
