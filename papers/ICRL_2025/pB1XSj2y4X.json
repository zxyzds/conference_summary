    "abstract": "Generative models in drug discovery have recently gained attention as efficient alternatives to brute-force virtual screening. However, most existing models do not account for synthesizability, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose RxnFlow, which sequentially assembles molecules using predefined molecular building blocks and chemical reaction templates to constrain the synthetic chemical pathway. We then train on this sequential generating process with the objective of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to generate both highly rewarded and diverse molecules. To mitigate the large action space of synthetic pathways in GFlowNets, we implement a novel action space subsampling method. This enables RxnFlow to learn generative flows over extensive action spaces comprising combinations of 1.2 million building blocks and 71 reaction templates without significant computational overhead. Additionally, RxnFlow can employ modified or expanded action spaces for generation without retraining, allowing for the introduction of additional objectives or the incorporation of newly discovered building blocks. We experimentally demonstrate that RxnFlow outperforms existing reaction-based and fragment-based models in pocket-specific optimization across various target pockets. Furthermore, RxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 for pocket-conditional generation, with an average Vina score of \u20138.85 kcal/mol and 34.8% synthesizability.",

                "value": "This paper introduces RXNFLOW, a generative framework that integrates synthesizability considerations into molecular generation for drug design. Following previous work, RXNFLOW addresses synthesizability by generating molecules using molecular building blocks, chemical reaction templates and a GFlowNet model. RXNFLOW aims to efficiently learn to sample from a large and complex action space, employing an action space subsampling technique to handle the combinatorial explosion of possible synthetic pathways. The authors claim that RXNFLOW achieves strong performance in pocket-specific and pocket-conditional generation tasks, with high synthesizability and diversity scores compared to previous models."

                "value": "**Weakness/points to be worked on:**\n\n- The main contribution of the works is the non-hierarchical and continuous action space. There are many theoretical benefits to this, but the benefit of their method is not concretely controlled with respect to the building block data used and compute budgets.\n    - I would recommend Figure 6 be amended with scaling laws for the SynFlowNet [1], RGFN [2] and SyntheMol [3] methods.\n- Another fundamental claim is that the model can generalise to \u2018\u2019unseen\u201d building blocks. While in theory their method should allow this, it has not been justified with experimental evidence.\n    - As far as I can tell, this is only benchmarked in Figure 5 which looks at QED. This is a highly uninformative metric given how well generative models do on QED. Benchmarking the seen and unseen molecules on one of the targets for instance would be a better example.\n    - Furthermore, a random split of the building blocks are used, given the high degree of redundancy in the Enamine Building Block set it is not surprising that performance does not change as these sets are highly similar. How does the model do on highly novel building blocks?\n- While technically impressive, I see no practical utility gained in the case on not retraining on new building block sets as (i) these libraries at not updated regularly and (ii) the costs of training these models are so small one would prefer to retrain a model anyways.\n    - The y-axis scales in Figure 6 are extremely narrow for many metrics and does not represent a meaningful change in values for Vina and Structural Diversity. For Figure 6b there is only a meaningful reduction in scaffold diversity when number of available building blocks is 10^2, an extremely smaller number and other works do not use.\n    - Furthermore, RGFN [2] introduces a similar method to scale to large build block spaces and a proper comparison is not conducted.\n- Some aspects of the evaluation could be improved:\n    - What is the with per run variance for the docking scores for molecules in Tables 1-4? Is there really a significant difference between the methods? I would recommend including per run box plots of Vina scores in the appendix.\n    - There is next to no discussion on the limitations of their model and possible future work\n    - L458: The authors do not include statistical tests or error bars/standard deviation values in Table 5 yet claim \u201dRXNFLow achieves significant improvements in drug-related properties\u201d in the CrossDocked experiments.\n    - No effort is made to disentangle the technical changes of the authors model v.s. building block library size when comparing to baselines.\n- The article is generally very well written but parts are not clear, for instance:\n    - The fact that the continuous embedding space is based on chemical fingerprints is not mentioned in the main text.\n    - Table 6:  No legend/keys are provided to indicate what the symbols mean. \n- L429: \u201cSince RXNFLOW explicitly considers synthesiz- ability, we exclude the SA score from the TacoGFN\u2019s reward function as described in Sec. C.2.\u201d.  I Could not find reference to SA score in Section C.2. Am I right in thinking the authors removed the SA reward from TacoGFN? In which case they ablated another model they are comparing to. Or have they removed it when training their model? Please clarify.\n- No code is provided.\n\n**Minor points:**\n- L122: \u201c...trained models with the GFlowNet objective\u201d, is it not more accurate to say these works propose reaction-based GFlowNet models?\n- I struggle to see the added value in Algorithm 1 in the main text. It does not aid in understanding the method. I recommend removing.\n- Table 6 seems wrong? \n- In Table 3, calling this metric \u201cPercentage of Synthesizable Molecules\u201d is misleading, as these are predicted not ground truth. I would prefer AIZynFinder success as done in the previous literature [1].\n- I appreciate the use of the LIT-PCBA targets, but is there a reason the SEH Proxy used in the rest of the GFlowNet literature [1,2] was not used?\n- Section B.1: The formulation sees to be highly inspired by SynFlowNet, if so please cite accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n1.

The paper introduces a simple yet effective approach, which is referred to as subspace sampling. The method takes a very simple formulation while it enables the reduction of complexity and enables feasible training of the algorithm. \n\n3.

Based on the bias/variance discussion in the appendix, does the proposed approach conduct a variance/efficiency tradeoff, i.e. large variance for high efficiency? This is a little counterintuitive for me, could the authors discuss this further. From the ablation in Fig. 6, with sufficient steps, a larger subspace shows better performance. Does the key benefit of the proposed method is accelerating the optimization?\n\n2. Some important baselines are suggested to be included in Table 5, for example [1] for atom-level SBDD. And the paper mentioned the recent relevant work [2], so why not include it? \n\n3. I would like to suggest the author include the SA score as another metric for evaluating the synthesizability.

In addition, a careful discussion of the differences from SynFlowNet is needed. Currently, the authors have avoided mentioning SynFlowNet in the introduction. According to my understanding, the method proposed in this paper has no structural difference from SynFlowNet in terms of the model framework, with some improvements in sampling techniques.
