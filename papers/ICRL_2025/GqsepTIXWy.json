    "title": "Bi-modality medical images synthesis by a bi-directional discrete process matching method",
    "abstract": "Recently, medical image synthesis gains more and more popularity, along with the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data modalities. Synthesized images can be  used for clinical diagnostic assistance, data augmentation for  model training and validation or image quality improving. In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative models for the ability of generating  realistic and high-quality synthetic images. However, most flow-based models require to  calculate flow ordinary different equation (ODE) evolution steps in synthesis process, for which the performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model, namely bi-directional Discrete Process Matching (Bi-DPM) to accomplish the bi-modality image synthesis tasks. Different to other flow matching based models,  we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flows and enhance the consistency on the intermediate images over a few discrete time steps, resulting in a synthesis process maintaining  high-quality generations for both modalities under the guidance of paired data. Our experiments on three datasets of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that Bi-DPM outperforms other state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, delivering higher image quality with accurate anatomical regions.",

Empirical validation: Experiments conducted on MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI datasets show that Bi-DPM outperforms state-of-the-art flow-based models, such as Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) and Rectified Flow (RF), in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and FID scores.\n\nx.

                "value": "The methodology may have an advantage over RF and CFM, but the authors have picked a bad application scenario. My major concern is the applicability of such methods in medical imaging. Unlike style translation in natural images, anatomy consistency is the utmost crucial factor in translating images between modalities. The MMD in (8) seems to be a very weak constraint for anatomical consistency in unpaired data. Is it even doable to translate medical images? Why can you recover T1/T2 properties of protons in the magnetic field given the HU in CT, there is as far as I know no theoretical ground to support this. \n\nThe results involved a physician rating, but the point here is not about letting them tell if the image is realistic. One can produce realistic images with many methods, like styleGAN, cycleGAN, etc., and many methods can do the same thing. The authors should have asked the question, \u201cdoes the translated image tell the same information as the real images from the machine?\u201d. The answer is probably no, because the resultant SSIM of CT-MRI is below 0.70. With such a low SSIM, most of the diagnostic-crucial information cannot be recovered. The algorithm is making random guesses in many areas. However, the accuracy of details are important for this task in clinical scenarios.\n \nThe experiments were not well-conducted, lacking ablation studies on hyper-parameters like the weight of the unpaired data MMD loss, which can be important for the final performances. The datasets are too small for a solid evaluation of the methods (described in sec. 3.2). \n\nThe figures of the paper are relatively hard to read, and the font size of the legends in Fig.5/7 is too small."
