    "title": "Securing Equal Share: A Principled Approach for Learning Multiplayer Symmetric Games",
    "abstract": "This paper examines multiplayer symmetric constant-sum games with more than two players in a competitive setting, including examples like Mahjong, Poker, and various board and video games. In contrast to two-player zero-sum games, equilibria in multiplayer games are neither unique nor non-exploitable, failing to provide meaningful guarantees when competing against opponents who play different equilibria or non-equilibrium strategies. This gives rise to a series of long-lasting fundamental questions in multiplayer games regarding suitable objectives, solution concepts, and principled algorithms. This paper takes an initial step toward addressing these challenges by focusing on the natural objective of *equal share*\u2014securing an expected payoff of $C/n$ in an $n$-player symmetric game with a total payoff of $C$. We rigorously identify the theoretical conditions under which achieving an equal share is tractable and design a series of efficient algorithms, inspired by no-regret learning, that *provably* attain approximate equal share across various settings. Furthermore, we provide complementary lower bounds that justify the sharpness of our theoretical results. Our experimental results highlight worst-case scenarios where meta-algorithms from prior state-of-the-art systems for multiplayer games fail to secure an equal share, while our algorithm succeeds, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

                "value": "The paper considers multiplayer symmetric constant-sum games, focusing on achieving equal share - where a player secures an expected payoff of $C/n$ in an n-player game with total payoff $C$. This work is particularly relevant for games like Mahjong, Poker, and Diplomacy, where traditional two-player zero-sum game theory falls short.\n\nThe paper makes serveral theoretical contributions. First, they identify two conditions for achieving equal share (over the worst case): all opponents must deploy the same strategy, and they must have limited adaptivity while being modeled by the learning agent. \n\nFor fixed opponents, they employ the Hedge algorithm; for slowly adapting opponents, they introduce the SAOL_H algorithm; and for intermediately adapting opponents, they utilize behavior cloning. Importantly, they provide matching lower bounds that demonstrate their algorithms are near optimal."

                "value": "The paper studies n-player symmetric constant-sum games, specifically how an agent can guarantee themselves a 1/n- fraction, i.e. \"equal share\" of the total payoff.  They identify conditions under which a learner can guarantee themselves this equal share against (n-1) opponents. The paper also studies various no-regret algorithms that can guarantee equal share under these conditions and compares their performance to self-play based meta-learners.\n\nThey identify two conditions necessary for a single player, called the learner, to learn a strategy that gives them their equal share in a repeated interaction - \n1. All the other (n-1) players, called the opponents, must deploy the same strategy\n2. The opponents must have limited adaptivity over the rounds of play\n\nThe first condition is shown via analyzing the one-shot version of the game and showing that the minimax theorem does not hold in symmetric n-player constant sum games. This condition is justified by studying the game against opponents drawn from a large random population. The second condition is additionally required to show that strongly adaptive no-regret algorithms achieve small dynamic regret against opponents with limited adaptivity. For intermediate rates of adaptivity, the paper also studies the payoff obtained by mimicking the identical opponents. The final theoretical result is to show matching lower bounds for dynamic regret.\n\nThe paper also experimentally compares the performance of these algorithms against that of existing self-play based frameworks."

In particular, the paper introduces some exemplar multiplayer symmetric games, such as the majority/ minority vote game, which demonstrate useful properties that provide insight into the nature of equilibria and best-responses in multiplayer symmetric games.

In particular, the lower bounds extend previous results about general multiplayer games to the special case of symmetric games."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are two main weaknesses in my view:\n\n1. One of the main technical results in the paper is about dynamic regret bounds against opponents with limited adaptivity in changing their strategies (and consequently the online optimization environment they induce). To what extent are the ideas in this result different from prior work in this area - is there something specific to symmetric games (such as faster convergence) that is explored in the paper? More broadly, this raises a concern about the technical depth and significance of the results.\n \n2. I do not understand the comparison to self-play. If I understand correctly, self-play is used to come up with a static strategy (via playing copies of the learner) that is then tested against a particular benchmark strategy for the (n-1) opponents. Importantly, the self-play process does not get to see the opponents' strategy while learning. On the other hand, the no-regret algorithms get to see the opponents' strategy, either fixed or slowly changing, and are allowed to adapt to this strategy. I'm not sure how meaningful this comparison is, since it does not appear to compare the same shape of object."

Is there something specific to symmetric games (such as faster convergence) that is explored in the paper? Is there a reason that results about dynamic regret do not directly imply Theorem 5.2.\n\n2. Does it make sense to compare self-play to no-regret (and variants) given that the two frameworks (as set up in the paper) get to see different levels of information? For example, if the experiments adversarially pick the opponent strategy based on the result of self-play, then the comparison is trivial since we would then be comparing playing first (self-play) versus best-responding while playing second (no-regret)."

Common solution concepts, such as Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria, have many deficiencies, and so attempting to explore different concepts that overcome those issues is certainly a fruitful research direction. The paper contributes to this line of work by proposing a natural objective, described above, which appears to be novel in its current form. Further, the authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which that solution concept can be attained. The conditions are very interpretable and natural, and provide a theoretical framework to design principled algorithms in practice. It is plausible that the approach of the paper can guide the performance of systems in practice. The paper is generally well-written, and all claims appear to be sound. The scope of the paper would also make it a good fit for a conference such as ICLR."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "On the negative side, my main concern is about the novelty of the results. First, all the observations made in the paper (Section 3 and in part Section 6) about the other solution concepts and the self-play framework are well-known and immediate. It is clear that one can devise simple examples where common solution concepts fail in terms of the objective put forward by the paper. The more interesting question, in my opinion, is why the self-play framework performs that well in games such as multi-player poker despite those obvious deficiencies. In terms of the conditions identified in the paper in order to achieve equal share, it is again fairly immediate to see that there are necessary and sufficient. In particular, when the opponents are not fully adaptive, most of the positive results obtained in Section 5 follow readily from existing results in the literature on dynamic regret. As to whether equal share is a reasonable objective, I don't believe there is a definite answer. The fact that it does not correspond to an equilibrium is an obvious concern, but I understand that going beyond equilibrium will be necessary to make progress in this line of work. Overall, I believe that the technical contributions of the paper do not go far enough compared to existing results to merit acceptance."
