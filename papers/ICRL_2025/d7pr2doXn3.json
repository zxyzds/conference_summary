    "title": "Hybrid Regularization Improves Diffusion-based Inverse Problem Solving",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models, recognized for their effectiveness as generative priors, have become essential tools for addressing a wide range of visual challenges. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging Denoising processes for Regularization (DR) to solve inverse problems. However, existing methods often face issues such as mode collapse, which results in excessive smoothing and diminished diversity. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint the root causes of gradient inaccuracies inherent in DR. Drawing on insights from diffusion model distillation, we propose a novel approach called Consistency Regularization (CR), which provides stabilized gradients without the need for ODE simulations. Building on this, we introduce Hybrid Regularization (HR), a unified framework that combines the strengths of both DR and CR, harnessing their synergistic potential. Our approach proves to be effective across a broad spectrum of inverse problems, encompassing both linear and nonlinear scenarios, as well as various measurement noise statistics. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets, including FFHQ and ImageNet, demonstrate that our proposed framework not only achieves highly competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers significant reductions in wall-clock time and memory consumption.",

                "value": "This paper builds on the concept of denoising regularization (DR) for solving inverse problems. Inspired by recent advancements like Red-Diff, which utilizes denoising score matching as a regularization term, the authors introduce a new approach termed consistency regularization (CR). CR adopts the central idea of consistency distillation (CD), which improves self-consistency by minimizing the difference between outputs at two consecutive reverse sampling points. However, the authors note that a direct application of CD can lead to oversaturation and artifacts due to insufficient randomness in the noise sampling process within CD. To address this, they propose a hybrid regularization (HR) framework, which incorporates hybrid noise modeling from the DDIM formulation. Experimental results suggest that HR achieves state-of-the-art performance in various inverse problem settings."

                "value": "Despite its contributions, the paper has several notable limitations. First, to substantiate HR's advantages over DR, a comparative ablation study incorporating the hybrid noise model into the DR framework should have been conducted. The reviewer suspects that HR's benefits stem from mitigating DR's mode-collapse behavior due to the hybrid noise model rather than the use of CR, a point the current manuscript and experiments have not sufficiently addressed.\n\nSecond, although the hybrid noise model may appear novel within the Red-Diff framework, the final formulation lacks originality. Specifically, the hybrid noise model and gradient step in equation (11) represent a simplified, one-step version of the decomposed diffusion sampling (DDS) framework [1]. In DDS, the denoised image, obtained through Tweedie\u2019s formula, is updated using a multi-step conjugate gradient (CG) approach, after which hybrid noise is introduced within the DDIM framework. The authors appear unaware of DDS, as there are no comparisons against it.\n\n[1] Chung, H., Lee, S., & Ye, J. C. Decomposed Diffusion Sampler for Accelerating Large-Scale Inverse Problems. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations. 2024\n\nThird, the reviewer finds the authors' assertion about the growing interest in DR for inverse problems unconvincing. Posterior sampling remains predominant in achieving state-of-the-art results in inverse problems. Moreover, contrary to the authors' claims, recent approaches such as DDS bypass Jacobian computation by leveraging piecewise linear manifold structures. Therefore, this assertion appears unsupported.\n\nFinally, the literature review and experimental comparisons with the latest approaches such as DDS,  are insufficient, lacking several significant recent works."

To my understanding, this is not the case for image generation from noise based on the original consistency distillation paper [Song et al. 2023]. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the Consistency Regularization (CR) results do get better structures but also introduce artifacts and noise. Also in Figure 1 middle column, the images look a bit noisy even under the Hybrid Regularization (HR) method. In Figure 10 the problem seems more visible ($\\beta=0$). I would like to hear more insights on this if this is a potential issue."

As shown in the original consistency distillation paper [Song et al. 2023], the amount of variations in the generated images  (measured by recall [Kynka\u00a8anniemi et al. 2019]) can be reduced due to consistency distillation.\n- As discussed in the \"Weakness\" section above, could the authors provide more insight on why the proposed method can lead to over-sharpened or noisy images?\n- The equation of consistency distillation has a moving average (EMA) term in the original paper [Song et al. 2023], denoted by $\\theta^{-}$. Is it also the case in Equation 12 or the same network is applied for two different time steps?\n- Equation 14 shows that the regularization requires 2x network inference denoted by epsilon_theta, but this does not slow down the optimization process. Is it because the effect of reducing the number of iterations is more significant than the extra computation cost?\n- I am a bit confused about what should I expect in Figure 6, since I am not familiar with compressed sensing and phase retrievel. Given such highly distorted images, is it possible to recover the results that can match the reference so well? The same question applies to Figure 7 on the nonlinear deblurring results.\n\nSome minor comments:\n- In line 421-422, \"FFHD\" should be \"FFHQ\"."

What if we follow this paper to use consistency model directly in the original RED-diff framework?  Can this, to some extent, play the same role as Consistency Regularization (CR)?  \n\n[main concern] The consistency to the measurement is not evaluated and compared. This line of works solve inverse problems, shoud the consistency to the measurement also be a important metric in addition to the image reconstruction quality? For example, In DPS and RED-diff, PSNR between reconstruction and ground truth is reported, which can represent the consistency to measurement to some extent. I am not requiring achieving SOTA PSNR and SOTA FID at the same time. But it helps to have some fidelity evaluation."
