    "title": "Applications of Modular Co-Design  for De Novo 3D Molecule Generation",
    "abstract": "De novo 3D molecule generation is a pivotal task in drug discovery. However, many\nrecent geometric generative models struggle to produce high-quality 3D structures,\neven if they maintain 2D validity and topological stability. To tackle this issue\nand enhance the learning of effective molecular generation dynamics, we present\nMegalodon\u2013a family of simple and scalable transformer models. These models\nare enhanced with basic equivariant layers and trained using a joint continuous\nand discrete denoising co-design objective. We assess Megalodon\u2019s performance\non established molecule generation benchmarks and introduce new 3D structure\nbenchmarks that evaluate a model\u2019s capability to generate realistic molecular\nstructures, particularly focusing on energetics. We show that Megalodon achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in 3D molecule generation, conditional structure generation,\nand structure energy benchmarks using diffusion and flow matching. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that scaling Megalodon produces up to 49x more valid molecules\nat large sizes and 2-10x lower energy compared to the prior best generative models.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a method for unconditional 3D molecule generation. The proposed approach, called Megalodon, represents molecules with both 3D structure and 2D topology information (atom coordinates and types, bond types and formal charge). The model uses a transformer-based architecture and either diffusion or flow-matching generative model. The proposed approach achieves positive results on experiments on GEOM-drugs dataset."

In particular, there is a lot of training/evaluation details missing, making reproducibility challenging. \n- The paper lacks novelty. The paper uses well-stablished generative models (diffusion or flow matching, already used many times on this task) on a single standard dataset (GEOM-drugs). \n- Many of the parameters choices were made ad hoc. It would be great to see some ablation studies to justify many of the architecture choices made by the authors (eg, the self conditioning, the modifications on DiT architecture).\n- The authors only show results in one single dataset (GEOM-drugs). It would be nice to see results in other datasets to make sure results are generalizable, eg QM9, PubChem3D, or other related tasks that relies on different dataset (eg, structure-condition generation instead of only conformer generation), etc.\n- The paper misses a lot of references/comparison to related works: eg, GeoLDM (Xu et al, ICML23), VoxMol (Pinheiro et al, NeurIPS23), GeoBFN (Song et al, ICLR24). All these works also explore the problem of unconditional molecule generation. Moreover, the authors wrongly cite MolDiff (Xu et al 23), mentioning that they dont model bond, while they actually do (L120)."

                "value": "- Why use only a subset of the metrics proposed by the MiDi paper on Table 1, instead of all the metrics? Also, why ignore the \"3D distributional\" metrics from MiDi?\n- Could the authors elaborate more on how the \"self-conditioning\" is applied? WHy the choice of using it vs not using it? What is the contribution of self conditioning? \n-  DiT is a model created to operate on images and much of its inductive bias operate on that data domain. Why did the authors decide to use DiT on their model? What about any other transformer-like architecture? DiT also has a autoencoder to go from pixel to latent space, and it seems that the proposed model does not have that.\n- From my understanding, the architecture is composed of equivariant and non-equivariant layers (which end up being a non-equivarant model). Is this correct? If so, why this design choice?\n- Could the authors elaborate on why did the proposed model is able to generate conformations from molecular graph, while EQGAT-Diff does not? From my understanding the only difference between the two models is the neural network architecture, and it seems quite surprising that this makes such a difference on teh results."

                "value": "1. How is equivariance preserved? From Appendix B.1.3, it seems the structure blocks should also take the input coordinates and combine them with the DiT block output to update the structure. Intuitively, there should be a skip connection from the input 3D coordinates to the structure blocks. Otherwise the coordinate information would be lost. However, Fig 1 indicates the DiT blocks and structure layers are sequential, where the structure blocks only take the DiT output (which is invariant) to predict the structure. Could the authors clarify on this?\n2. For conditional generation, how is the 2D graph information provided to the diffusion model?"

While the authors introduce a combination of diffusion and flow matching objectives, this integration alone does not constitute a major advancement, as flow matching is a theoretically more general framework than diffusion. There is no surprise that these two objectives can be used in one framework."
