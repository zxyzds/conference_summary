    "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of complex real-world systems from temporal snapshot data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as gene regulation, climate change, and financial market fluctuations. Researchers have recently proposed a few methods based either on the Schroedinger Bridge or Flow Matching to tackle this problem, but these approaches remain limited in their ability to effectively combine data from multiple time points and different experimental settings. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios where observations from certain combinations of time points and experimental conditions are missing, either because of experimental costs or sensory failure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method named Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (MMFM). MMFM first constructs a flow using smooth spline-based interpolation across time points and conditions and regresses it with a neural network using the classifier-free guided Flow Matching framework. This framework allows for the sharing of contextual information about the dynamics across multiple trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a recent single-cell genomics data set with around a hundred chemical perturbations across time points. Our results show that MMFM significantly outperforms existing methods at imputing data at missing time points.",

Current methods, such as Flow Matching, remain limited by the inability to effectively capture information across multiple time points and experimental conditions.

The empirical evidence they provide is strong but limited. \nThe experiments are well-designed and include sufficient baselines. The authors appear to know the literature very well and do a good job providing citations throughout. \nThe paper is well-written and organized and easy to follow. I particularly appreciate how the authors clearly provide the minimally sufficient information in the main body of the paper and detail the appendix to complement."

In the introduction of the paper, the authors give a multitude of real-world settings where their method may be considered useful. While the authors clearly motivate their method, I am concerned by the rigor with which they evaluate their method empirically. Are there additional datasets that could further demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, such as some of the genomics datasets used in Tong et al. (2024)? If so, inclusion would greatly increase this paper's contribution."

The proposed approach extends the Flow Matching (FM) framework by incorporating multiple time points and conditions, thereby learning the transport of probability distributions for cellular states across these different scenarios. MMFM leverages techniques like smooth spline-based interpolation and neural networks with classifier-free guidance to model changes over time and conditions. Through experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, the authors show MMFM's superior performance in imputing missing time points compared to other baseline methods."

The multi-step transport approach is impressive in efficiently capturing the system's temporal and conditional complexities.\n\n- The method extends (Conditional) Flow Matching (FM) to the *Multi-Marginal** setting, which is a natural and well-justified progression for addressing biological systems that require modeling across multiple time points. This approach enables the framework to leverage inter-dependencies across multiple conditions, significantly enhancing generalizability.\n\n - The use of **optimal transport** and **Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge** for improving the integration of multiple marginals is insightful, resulting in improved model robustness. Compared to **piece-wise linear interpolation**, the introduction of cubic splines for smoother interpolation significantly boosts the performance and efficiency of the model, which is well demonstrated in their experiments."

                "value": "- The title, **\"Modeling Complex System Dynamics,\"** might be an over-claim relative to the paper's focus, which is primarily on **biological single-cell dynamics**. Typically, \"Complex System Dynamics\" also refers to broader scenarios, such as physical phenomena in fluid dynamics, climate systems, or even economic time series. Since the proposed method appears promising and generalizable, demonstrating its applicability to tasks in broader domains would further strengthen this claim.\n\n- In the Multi-Marginal Conditional Flow Matching (MMCF), the authors pre-compute the solution for the multi-marginal optimal transport, which can be time-consuming. While they mention that **mini-batches** can be used to handle large datasets, further discussion on the **scalability** of the approach would be valuable. In particular, it would help if the authors could expand on the tradeoff between the **performance** and **efficiency** when comparing **L-MMFM** and **MMCF**, as OT solvers tend to become computationally expensive with increased dimensionality.\n\n- Although MMFM is demonstrated effectively on biological single-cell data, there is no extensive discussion about its generalization capabilities in handling diverse temporal datasets beyond biology. Considering the potential to model other types of time series (e.g., physical or environmental data), the paper would benefit from a discussion about such possible applications and any inherent limitations."

Can **MMFM** handle **non-uniformly sampled** time points? If so, how is this addressed within the interpolation or flow matching framework?\n\n[1]: Tashiro, Yusuke, et al. \"Csdi: Conditional score-based diffusion models for probabilistic time series imputation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 24804-24816."
