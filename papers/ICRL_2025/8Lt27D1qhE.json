    "title": "Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation",
    "abstract": "3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene and represent them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance. However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning. Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.",

                "value": "The paper aims to address two primary limitations of existing transformer-based methods: (i) the difficulty in simultaneously maintaining strong positional and content information during query initialization, and (ii) a issue of object disappearance as decoder layers deepen, due to supervision at each layer. To tackle these issues, the authors introduce (a) an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module, designed to create queries that achieve a balance between foreground positional coverage and content learning. (b) Additionally, they propose a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder that preserves low-overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall as layers deepen and thereby addressing the object disappearance problem.

Why is the proposed query initialization module named \u201cAgent-Interpolation\u201d? The term \u201cagent\u201d may misleadingly suggest autonomous agents. A more intuitive name could avoid confusion.\n\n3. What motivates the use of \u201cBottom-K masks\u201d for selecting low-overlapping masks? Why not using an IoU threshold (either learnable or fixed) which might be more intuitive for determining overlap.\n\n4. Some bold claims, such as the method being \u201ctailored for navigating complex and dynamic environments,\u201d lack supporting experimental results or adequate explanations.\n\n5. Several additional hyperparameters of the proposed approach\u2014like the number of agents, distance threshold, and layers for query selection\u2014must be individually tuned per dataset (as per the appendix). How consistent are results if these hyperparameters  are kept the same across datasets?\n\n6. Test set results on ScanNet200 should ideally be included in the paper."

If so,  what happens if the IoU is zero for more than K masks\u2014are all of them considered?\n\n3. I strongly recommend submitting the ScanNetV2 results to the public leaderboard to facilitate more detailed comparisons across metrics.\n\n4.

For example, most of the paper contribution is in section 3.3.2, where more explanation would help understand the motivation of the choices made. This section is also not well connected to the main pipeline figure (Figure 3) as it does not mention FPS. \n- The proposed additions require various hyperparameters (number of sampled points,number of agents, number of neighbours, NMS parameters, distance threshold, number of layers to retain queries from). While the proposed approach shows improved results on various datasets, each dataset required a different set of hyperparameters (appendix). This indicates an additional training time requirement to select the best set of hyperparameters.\n- Test set results on ScanNet200 are missing.\n- Paper organization and visuals can be improved. For example, discussions on Table 5 appear very early (L236). Some visuals are inconsistent: Figure 2 shows FPS after agent, Figure 3 shows it in parallel, text says FPS before agent (L207)."

While the paper introduces techniques to improve query initialization and recall, the results show only marginal gains over recent methods like Maft, particularly on common benchmarks in metrics like AP and mAP. Furthermore, models like Spherical Mask outperform BFL in terms of a range of metrics. Thus, it is difficult to perceive the proposed method as revolutionary.\n2. The innovations in the paper are primarily focused on minor architectural adjustments (e.g., fusion techniques and query initialization schemes). Nowadays, these tricky designs will not provide significant new insights into 3D segmentation or address fundamental limitations in current transformer designs. For instance, can these designs significantly solve hard cases for 3D instance segmentation?\n3. The paper reports an increase in runtime compared to MAFT, coupled with the limited performance gain, raises concerns regarding the model\u2019s true insights.  As this method has heavy dependence on existing techniques, I just believe it's not interesting."
