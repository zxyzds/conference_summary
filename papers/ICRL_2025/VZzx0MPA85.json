    "title": "PersonaMath: Enhancing Math Reasoning through Persona-Driven Data Augmentation",
    "abstract": "While closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving abilities, open-source models continue to struggle with such tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a data augmentation approach and introduce PersonaMathQA, a dataset derived from MATH and GSM8K, on which we train the PersonaMath models. Our approach consists of two stages: the first stage is learning from Persona Diversification, and the second stage is learning from Reflection. In the first stage, we regenerate detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions as instructions using a closed-source LLM and introduce a novel persona-driven data augmentation technique to enhance the dataset's quantity and diversity. In the second stage, we incorporate reflection to fully leverage more challenging and valuable questions. Evaluation of our PersonaMath models on MATH and GSM8K reveals that the PersonaMath-7B model (based on LLaMA-2-7B) achieves an accuracy of 24.2\\% on MATH and 68.7\\% on GSM8K, surpassing all baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our dataset contains only 70.3K data points\u2014merely 17.8\\% of MetaMathQA and 27\\% of MathInstruct\u2014yet our model outperforms these baselines, demonstrating the high quality and diversity of our dataset, which enables more efficient model training. We open-source the PersonaMathQA dataset, PersonaMath models, and our code for public usage.",

Lack of innovation: The paper shows minimal methodological innovation compared to previous data augmentation work, primarily combining existing approaches for math problem augmentation rather than introducing new techniques. It directly uses data from Persona Hub for question rewriting, and a detailed discussion on math problem synthesis already provided in the Persona Hub paper\u2014Scaling Synthetic Data Creation with 1,000,000,000 Personas (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20094).\n2. Limited detail on persona-driven augmentation: The discussion on the use of Persona data is insufficient. There is no clear explanation of how the 200k Persona data points were selected for augmentation.\n3. Limited impact of reflection method: The reflection method only corrected 10% of incorrect problems in stage 2. While performance on GSM8K improved by 2.5% (as shown in Figure 4), performance on MATH slightly declined, which contradicts the claim that reflection significantly helps with more challenging problems.\n4. Insufficient experiments: Reporting results on additional math datasets beyond MATH and GSM8K, and comparing with more data augmentation methods, could strengthen the paper\u2019s persuasiveness."
