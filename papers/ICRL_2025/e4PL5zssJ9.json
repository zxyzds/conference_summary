    "title": "Symmetry-Driven Discovery of Dynamical Variables in Molecular Simulations",
    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for understanding complex biomolecular systems, but they are often hindered by the high dimensionality of the configurational space. This paper introduces two novel approaches for discovering effective degrees of freedom (DoF) in molecular dynamics simulations by leveraging approximate symmetries of the energy landscape. We present a scalable symmetry loss function compatible with existing force-field frameworks and a Hessian-based method efficient for smaller systems. Both approaches enable systematic exploration of conformational space by connecting structural dynamics to energy landscape symmetries. Applied to alanine dipeptide, our methods comprehensively sample the Ramachandran plot, including shallow minima. Simulations initiated from our DoF-sampled points converge to all important conformations, demonstrating the methods\u2019 effectiveness in navigating complex energy landscapes. These approaches offer powerful tools for efficient exploration in molecular simulations, with potential applications in protein folding and drug discovery.",

                "value": "The authors propose a method to discover effective degrees of freedom in molecular systems, for the aim of fast exploration of low-energy configuration space without prior knowledge of internal coordinates or collective variables. Effective degrees of freedom are directions in configuration space which approximately preserve the energy, and are in this sense viewed as symmetries of the energy. Specifically, degrees of freedom are unit vectors of the Lie algebra of the general linear group of transformations acting on configuration space. The authors propose a symmetry loss to find effective degrees of freedom, which are those along which energy changes minimally, but where conformation changes significantly. The authors refine this symmetry loss with variants using the Hessian of the energy. The proposed method is validated on the model system of alanine dipeptide, where it recovers all important conformers but with dramatically fewer timesteps of molecular dynamics."

                "value": "There are issues with presentation which hold this submission back from acceptance.\n\nThe major issue is that not enough analysis is given to characterize the learned degrees of freedom.\n- How does the conformation qualitatively change for a given learned degree of freedom? Do these actually resemble the individual true torsions?\n- It is stated that \"the degrees of freedom still remain invariant across\" conditions in vacuum and solvent - how can this be true if each column of Figs 2 and 4 discovers slightly different conformers?\n- What does the beta-sheet conformation look like, and where does it appear on the Ramachandran plot? Where do the rediscovered conformers lie on the plot?\n- In Figs 1 and 3, the twisted gridlines differ for each method, and do not appear to cover the entire phi-psi space. How should I interpret this? It is my understanding that the beta conformation should be located at the origin of these grids, but it is not clear to me where that is located.\n- Many conformers shown in Fig 4 do not visually resemble the leftmost column. What is the threshold for dihedral angle similarity?\n\nThere are numerous minor errors:\n- Citation style should have parentheses (\\citep) when not using the authors as a noun.\n- Inconsistent capitalization of \"Lie algebra\", \"Alanine dipeptide\", \"DOF\"\n- Line 50: \"symmetry, loss\"\n- Line 62: \"WE show\"\n- Line 192: should be $x'=gx$\n- Line 286: $H_2$ is defined incorrectly\n- Line 286: \"Then it also minimizes ... can be minimized\"\n- Line 343: \"Effective-ness\"\n- Line 345: Missing equation number\n- Line 363: \"m is the number samples\"\n- Line 377: \"Alanine Dipepetide\" is misspelled\n- Line 388: \"direct otimization\"\n- Lines 754-755: duplicate statements\n\nExperimental setup is not entirely clear. What optimization algorithm was used to minimize losses? How costly is this optimization in terms of number of energy gradient evaluations?\n\nWhat are the min/max bounds on the 31x31 gridpoints?"

How do the discovered degrees of freedom vary as the initial optimized point is varied?\n- Given that the proposed method locally searches for directions where energy remains flat, is it correct that the method would not be able to discover new minima that are separated from the initial point by large energy barriers?\n- Starting from a single optimized configuration, is it true that the method only requires calculating the Hessian once?\n- What, if any, challenges are expected when applying this method to energy functions defined by neural force fields?\n\nAn overview figure visualizing the learned effective degrees of freedom as paths on an energy landscape could help to quickly explain what these effective degrees of freedom are.\n\nSince energy calculation is usually the bottleneck in sampling, one way to quantitatively state your speedup is by listing the number of energy, gradient-energy, and Hessian evaluations required by each method.\n\nAnother metric, if just focused on sampling, could be the effective sample size (ESS) as measured for Boltzmann generators:\n\n- Klein, L., Kr\u00e4mer, A., & No\u00e9, F.
