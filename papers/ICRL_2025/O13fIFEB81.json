    "title": "Robust Watermarking for Diffusion Models: A Unified Multi-Dimensional Recipe",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models are known for the supreme capability to generate realistic images. However, ethical concerns, such as copyright protection and generation of inappropriate content, pose significant challenges for the practical deployment of diffusion models. Recent work has proposed a flurry of watermarking techniques that inject visually noteless patterns into generated images, offering a promising solution to these issues. While effective, the essential elements for watermarking and the interconnections among various methods are still chaos. In this paper, we dissect the design principles of state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and introduce a unified framework.  We identify a set of dimensions that explain the manipulation enforced by watermarking methods, including the distribution of individual elements, the specification of watermark regions within each channel, and the choice of channels for watermark embedding. Moreover, under this framework we instantiate a new watermarking method to minimize impacts on the model performance from a distributional perspective. Through the empirical studies on regular text-to-image applications and the first systematic attempt on watermarking image-to-image diffusion models, we thoroughly verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework through comprehensive evaluations. On all the diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion, our approach induced from the proposed framework not only preserves image quality but also outperforms existing methods in robustness against a range of attacks.",

Specifically, we would like to clarify their counterexample in weakness 5 is wrong.\n\n\n1. **First Scenario: Probability of At Least 2 Out of 3 Group Labels Being Correct**\n\n   For group-level correctness, let $Y \\sim \\text{Binomial}(3, 0.7)$, representing the correctness of individual group labels. The probability of at least 2 individual labels in a group being correct is: $p = P(Y \\geq 2) = P(Y=2) + P(Y=3)$=0.784.\n   For the overall group label correctness, let $Z \\sim \\text{Binomial}(3, p)$, where $p$ is the group-level correctness probability. The probability of at least 2 out of 3 group labels being correct is:\n\n   $$\n   P_1 = P(Z \\geq 2) = \\sum_{k=2}^{3} \\binom{3}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{3-k} = 0.880.\n   $$\n  \n2. **Second Scenario: Probability of At Least 6 Out of 9 Elements Being Correct**\n\n   Each element is correct with a probability of 0.7. Let $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(9, 0.7)$, representing the number of correct elements. The probability of at least 6 elements being correct is calculated as:\n\n   $$\n   P_2 = P(X \\geq 6) = \\sum_{k=6}^{9} \\binom{9}{k} (0.7)^k (0.3)^{9 - k} = 0.729.\n   $$\n\n\nSo the probability that **at least 2 out of 3 group labels are correct** ($P_1 \\approx 0.880$) is clearly greater than the probability that **at least 6 out of 9 elements are correct** ($P_2 \\approx 0.729$)."

The authors are encouraged to use metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS.\n2. While the paper claims that the dynamic watermarking technique increases robustness, it is primarily due to selecting the maximum score among all options. My concern is that different watermark patterns have bias towards different attacks, which lead to inaccuracy in presenting the performance of your method. (For example, for the attack of rotation, the gaussian ring is used, because it's better than that of random gaussian. But for other attacks random gaussian might be better, rather than gaussian ring.) The authors didn\u2019t show readers this point. The authors are recommended to demonstrate TPR@1%FPR score across all attackers, but this time only use one watermarking method, like only use \u2018random gaussian\u2019 for all the images.\n3. The paper proposed embedding the watermark on the spatial domain, rather than the frequency domain. I have concerns about this. Embedding watermarks in the spatial domain may result in a concentrated watermark information in a specific area. For example if a circle-like watermark is embedded in the central area of latent z_T, then if the central area of an image x_0 is dropped, the watermark may no longer be detectable."

I want to discuss my broader concerns regarding this paper and other similar papers that adding watermarks in the latent noise z_T. I appreciate the authors\u2019 significant efforts in coming up with an optimized method regarding three dimensions of the watermarking process. But, it seems they *focused too much* on the latent $z_T$, rather than the diffusion model. This gives me a feeling that this paper is \"stacking methods\". In the paper, the diffusion model is simply being treated as an encoder-decoder structure connecting the latent z and the image x. If diffusion model is serve in this way, could it be possible that this method can be applied to other similar models like VAE or GANs? Additionally, if time permits, the author can demonstrate some diffusion model-specific components/properties that drives them to only investigate diffusion model exclusively as the model in the experiments.\n\n\nThe score is negotiable.
