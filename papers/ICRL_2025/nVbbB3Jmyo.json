    "abstract": "Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have garnered significant interest from both researchers and industry due to their ability to address energy consumption challenges in graph classification. However, SGNs are typically inference under the same distribution of training dataset, which is difficult to satisfy in real applications. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce the novel framework named \\textbf{De}gree-aware \\textbf{S}piking \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{D}omain \\textbf{A}daptation for Classification (\\method{}). To address this problem, we propose solutions in terms of three aspects: node distribution-aware personalized spiking representation, graph feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation. Firstly, we introduce the personalized spiking representation method that varies with node degrees. The difficulty of triggering a spike is determined by the node degree, allowing this personalized approach to capture more expressive information for classification. Then, we propose the graph feature distribution alignment module that is adversarially trained using membrane potential against a domain discriminator, efficiently maintaining high performance and low energy consumption in the case of inconsistent distribution. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. \nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \\method{} compared with baselines.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a framework called DeSGDA to tackle the problem of domain adaptation in spiking graph neural networks. DeSGDA combines three key components: a degree-aware spiking representation that adapts spiking thresholds based on node degree, adversarial distribution alignment to minimize discrepancies between source and target domains, and pseudo-label distillation to improve model performance on unlabeled target data. The authors provide theoretical bounds on the generalization error of their framework and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating DeSGDA\u2019s superiority over other baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy and energy efficiency."

The authors bring together two distinct challenges\u2014spiking neural networks and domain adaptation\u2014within the context of graph data. However, the novelty of this problem setup raises questions about the practical relevance and contribution of the paper, as such a scenario may be uncommon in real-world applications.\n2. The authors mention in the Introduction that this problem may exist in Electroencephalography (EEG) data, however, they did not conduct experiments on such data. The datasets used in this paper are mainly protein, molecular, and chemical graphs, can the authors give explanations about what are the applicable scenarios on these data? especially given that, in these domains, accuracy often takes precedence over timeliness.\n3. The adversarial learning on both source and target domains, and the pseudo-labeling strategy on target graphs are very familiar techniques in domain adaptation methods. The contribution is limited. \n4. The methodology assumes that the node degree is a key factor for domain adaptation in spiking graph networks. More explanation on why \u201csetting higher thresholds for high-degree nodes and lower thresholds for low-degree node\u201d should be added.\n5. In some real-world datasets, besides the degree, other structural or feature-based factors might impact the domain shift. Focusing heavily on degree-aware thresholds may overlook other graph properties.\n6. The definition of V_th is not given."

The core idea of DeSGDA is three parts, i.e., node degree-aware personalized spiking representation, adversarial feature distribution alignment, and pseudo-label distillation.

                "value": "1. There shows many inconsistencies in the reported experimental results, which makes me much unconfident about the real performance of proposed method:\n    - In Figure 2, the reported results for the \"PROTEINS\" dataset do not match those presented in Table 1, Table 9, or Table 12. Specifically, in Figure 2, P1-->P0 (GIN) performance is about 0.75~0.76. However, in Table 1, the performance is 84.6; in Table 9, the performance is 78.4; in Table 12, the performance is 84.3. Any of the data in the three tables is inconsistent with the results in Figure 2. There are also some other situations that do not match. This difference raises significant questions about the consistency of experimental results. Further clarification is must to confirm accuracy and reproducibility.\n    - In Figure 3, there is no label corresponding to \"DeSGDA\".\n\n 2. In this paper, the authors first make the assumption that  \"Nodes with higher degrees have more neighbors, and the aggregation operation in Eq. 1 allows for more significant feature accumulation, making it easier for these nodes to trigger spikes compared to those with fewer neighbors. \" This assumption is valid if a direct summation-based neighbor information aggregation is used. However, it remains unclear if this holds for other aggregation methods, such as GAT which is weighted average based on attention score, and GCN which is weighted average based on structural information. Further discussion on this assumption is needed.\n\n3. I really appreciate the degree-aware personalized spiking representation design. However, this paper aims to tackle with the OOD problem. It shows limited technical contribution for graph domain adaptation. The adversarial learning and pseudo-labeling are both well-investigated method in existing DA works.\n\n4. The experiments primarily focus on binary classification tasks using standard graph classification datasets. More complex experiment setting, e.g., multi-class scenarios rather than all binary classification, is welcome to fully assess the model\u2019s capability.\n\n5. The paper does not adequately explain why DeSGDA outperforms general graph domain adaptation methods, like DEAL, CoCo, and A2GNN. An analysis of how DeSGDA specifically enhance performance beyond standard graph DA approaches would better highlight its advantages.\n\n6. Since the degree-aware component design is crucial  to the performance improvements of DeSGDA, it is recommended to provide specific theoretical analysis for this component to strengthen the core contribution. Of course, I understand that this is often not easy, just as a suggestion that the author can consider for future work."
