    "abstract": "Modeling precise geometric and semantic relationships in 3D remains one of the greatest challenges in generative machine learning today, partly because of a lack of large 3D datasets in the public domain. Drawing upon the successful adoption of synthetic datasets in the computer vision community, we propose to address this challenge in the context of 3D buildings with SYNBUILD-3D, a large, multi-modal, and domain-specific dataset of more than 100,000 3D building wireframes along with their corresponding floor plan images. Unlike existing 3D building datasets, SYNBUILD-3D has been designed with and validated by building modeling and simulation experts, providing rich geometric and semantic information. As a result, SYNBUILD-3D is, to the best of our knowledge, the first 3D building dataset that provides interior and exterior building geometries, including the position and size of doors and windows derived from the floor plans. By releasing SYNBUILD-3D, we aim to offer the geometric deep learning community a high-quality dataset for conditional and unconditional 3D building generation tasks. In contrast to existing datasets that typically focus on modeling either the interior or exterior of 3D objects, SYNBUILD-3D can facilitate the development of generative algorithms that account for both perspectives while incorporating geometric and semantic constraints. The dataset and its associated codebase are available at GITHUB LINK.",

Real-world architectural applications often require varied building geometries.\n\n3. Lack of Evaluation with Baseline Models: \nThe paper does not present any baseline results or example models trained on SYNBUILD-3D, making it difficult to assess the dataset's immediate effectiveness for advancing generative 3D building research.

The dataset includes 100,000 3D wireframe models of buildings paired with corresponding floor plan images. Each 3D model captures both the exterior and interior of a building, annotated with room types and structural details, including the position and dimensions of windows and doors.\n\nTo build this dataset, the process starts by generating random building exteriors using an off-the-shelf procedural generation engine. The building's footprint is then used to guide a separate floor plan generator specialized in residential layouts, producing a compatible floor plan for each structure. This floor plan is vectorized and annotated with room labels and positions and sizes of doors and windows. Following this, an alignment optimization step is applied to ensure that the floor plan aligns accurately with the building's footprint. The aligned floor plan is then extruded to the volume of the building.\n\nThe paper also discusses potential applications for SYNBUILD-3D in tasks such as unconditional and conditional 3D building generation."

While it provides a brief discussion on potential methods, it is crucial to include quantitative and qualitative evaluations of these methods (or their adaptations) on the proposed dataset. Additionally, incorporating a graph-based baseline that leverages the dataset\u2019s inherent graph-like structure would be beneficial, as this could illustrate how such a representation supports the outlined generative tasks.\n- Directly transferring room type labels and door and window geometries from the generated floor plans to annotate the 3D wireframes results in multistorey buildings with unrealistic, repetitive interiors and exteriors. For example, it is uncommon in a three-storey building to have a kitchen on each floor, stacked one above the other."

Also modern buildings and historical buildings can have very different layouts). The examples illustrated in the paper also shows limited diversity.\n- Limited structural complexity: The dataset enforces minimum footprint areas and alignment thresholds to ensure model consistency, which may exclude smaller, intricate structures, e.g. unusual room shapes, densely packed spaces. There is a gap between this representation and real-world scenarios.\n- Demonstration: the demonstration quality of this paper is sub-par, with limited number of examples, limited variation of the building and without supplimentary. Only 4 examples are given in the paper, all demonstrating simple and similar structures (extruded from a floorplan). Feature distribution in Fig3. is not a direct evidence for data diversity.\n- Downstream application motivation is weak: authors mentioned unconditional (e.g. layout generation) and conditional 3D building generation (point cloud to wireframe, and wireframe to wireframe, also image to wireframe). However, the proposed dataset does not contain paired point cloud data or rendering of the room (except floormap). The application seems quite narrow and less straightforward."

                "value": "- Is it possible to expand beyond basic floorplan and wireframe generation, which only indicate room locations, doors, and windows, to support more complex and intricate indoor scene layouts?\n\n- The choice to exclude existing works as baselines is unclear. The authors should benchmark established algorithms on their dataset; if these models were trained on other datasets, they could be retrained with the new dataset. Testing or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on generation tasks would also be straightforward. \n\n- Wireframe generation can be approached similarly to tasks like layout and mesh generation, albeit with unique constraints. For example, HouseGan and HouseGan++ address room floorplan generation; if their input bubble diagrams were modified to include walls, doors, and windows, they would serve as plausible baselines. BlockPlanner, which tackles city layout generation with vectorized representations similar to wireframes, could also be adapted for this task. From a mesh perspective, MeshGPT could similarly be adapted for wireframe generation. LLMs also seem well-suited, as LayoutGPT has shown effectiveness in image and room layout generation. The authors should discuss relevant approaches and potential modifications to these models for wireframe generation in this context."
