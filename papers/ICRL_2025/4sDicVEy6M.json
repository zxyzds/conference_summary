    "title": "What Do You See in Common? Learning Hierarchical Prototypes over Tree-of-Life to Discover Evolutionary Traits",
    "abstract": "A grand challenge in biology is to discover evolutionary traits---features of organisms common to a group of species with a shared ancestor in the tree of life (also referred to as phylogenetic tree). With the growing availability of image repositories in biology, there is a tremendous opportunity to discover evolutionary traits directly from images in the form of a hierarchy of prototypes. However, current prototype-based methods are mostly designed to operate over a flat structure of classes and face several challenges in discovering hierarchical prototypes, including the issue of learning over-specific prototypes at internal nodes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the framework of Hierarchy aligned Commonality through Prototypical Networks (HComP-Net). The key novelties in HComP-Net include a novel over-specificity loss to avoid learning over-specific prototypes, a novel discriminative loss to ensure prototypes at an internal node are absent in the contrasting set of species with different ancestry, and a novel masking module to allow for the exclusion of over-specific prototypes at higher levels of the tree without hampering classification performance.  We empirically show that HComP-Net learns prototypes that are accurate, semantically consistent, and generalizable to unseen species in comparison to baselines.",

Given the scarcity of high-quality biological images, especially in the context of vast evolutionary networks, and the inherent issues of imbalance and interference in such images, I wonder if it might be more precise to analyze common traits directly from textual descriptions or anatomical data. Could you please elaborate on the rationale behind prioritizing visual data for this task?\n\n2. The paper introduces several loss functions aimed at ensuring the diversity and effectiveness of the learned prototypes. I would be very interested to see ablation studies on these loss functions to better understand their individual impact.\n\n3. In Figure 4, when comparing the part consistency between HComP-Net and HPNet, different bird images are used. I am curious to know if this choice is justified and, if so, what the reasoning behind it is. Would it not be more appropriate to use the same images for a clearer comparison?"

This can decrease the practicality of the method. Statements such as \u201cFurthermore, HComP-Net demonstrates a unique ability to generate novel hypotheses about evolutionary traits, showcasing its potential in advancing our understanding of evolution\u201d are too bold in my opinion.\n- Another issue with a possible practical use of the method is that the proposed solution to provide semantically meaningful information requires human annotation, which can be very subjective. The authors mention this limitation in the appendix, however they do not give any solution for a mitigation. \n- minor: some typos/grammatical mistakes can be found in the paper, e.g. \u201cthat are not just shared across all it descendant species but are also\u201d -> \u201cthat are not just shared across all ITS descendant species but are also\u201d"

Why ProtoPNet is not used in the comparative experiments (also other non-hierarchical models are used there)?\n- How can the paper help to \u201cadvance our understanding of evolution\u201d? E.g. There is a high chance that for the common species (whose pictures are available in large-scale datasets) the same features that were already used to make such a classification will be highlighted. Could the authors present a use case, in which the solution could be successfully used in practice to contribute to the understanding of evolution?\n- How are the representative images (also could be perceived as prototypical images) chosen from the dataset to allow for proper explanations (some images can be taken e.g. from a non-typical angle and do not show the prototypical features well and make the explanations difficult)?\n- Is it possible (and if yes, how) to use this solution in other hierarchical problems (not in the area of biology)?"

These functions enable HComP-Net to learn prototypes that align with the hierarchical structure of the tree, enhancing interpretability and consistency. Empirical results highlight HComP-Net\u2019s ability to produce accurate, semantically coherent prototypes transferable to unseen species. Tested on a dataset of 190 bird species and additional organisms, the model performs better than baseline models. Additionally, HComP-Net has been shown to generate visual hypotheses on evolutionary traits, offering insight into traits across various levels of the phylogenetic tree.

                "value": "1) On the Need for a Separate Masking Module\nThe fact that an additional masking module is required suggests that the initial contributions, particularly the over-specificity and discriminative loss functions, may not fully address the issue of over-specific prototypes. This need points to a limitation in the proposed loss functions' effectiveness in preventing prototypes from becoming overly tailored to specific species. Ideally, a more robust solution would directly manage prototype specificity through the loss functions alone, reducing reliance on extra modules that could complicate the model and potentially impact interpretability or scalability.\n\n2) On the Role of the Phylogenetic Tree in Classification\nIn section 5.1, the authors suggest that achieving high classification accuracy is not the primary goal. However, providing the model with additional information, like a phylogenetic tree during training and inference, could indeed aid classification performance. The tree may allow the model to leverage hierarchical relationships, which could enhance classification accuracy by using shared traits among related species. Thus, there seems to be a disconnect between the claim of not prioritizing classification accuracy and the model's design, which inherently includes information that could enhance it."

This point should be clarified in title and method description. \n2. The exclusion of certain related works leaves me a question about novelty on practical impact. For instance, PIPNet, a recent and closely related method employing self-supervised learning (2023), is not included in the comparison. It only uses HPNet from 2019. However, semantic gaps has relevance to over-specificity, and authors also mention strong motivation from PIPNet.
