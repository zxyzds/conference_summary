    "title": "CASD: Enhancing Generation Accuracy via Context-Aware Speculative Decoding",
    "abstract": "With recent advancements in long-context model variants, Large language models (LLMs) can conveniently process different types of task-related information by simply converting them into an input sequence, even consisting of over 100K tokens. Though with a simple and unified form, there is still considerable room in leveraging input context effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective CASD (Context-Aware Speculative Decoding) method to boost context usage. CASD is a decoding algorithm that requires no extra training or draft models. It improves not only generation performance but also inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering, summarization and code completion tasks in LongBench) show that CASD increases the average generation score by 3.3 points. CASD achieves a mean acceptance length of 3.10 and a speed-up ratio of 1.99. Moreover, CASD integrates effectively with context compression technology, addressing the issue of excessive memory overhead caused by long contexts. Since CASD directly retrieves token-level content from the input context to boost the generation accuracy, it can effectively mitigate the possible side-effects of context compression methods when crucial context information is dropped.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* One limitation of CASD is its generalizability to all tasks. While it excels in tasks that benefit from direct context, its effectiveness may be limited in tasks requiring abstractive or creative generations. \n\n* As stated in the paper, CASD conflicts with common sampling techniques in autoregressive models, which makes it less practical for many scenarios that require multiple generations per sample. \n\n* Although the experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, the baseline is too limited, which is vanilla decoding of LlaMa3.1-8B-instruct model only. While it\u2019s understandable to skip decoding methods that require additional training or draft models, there are other training-free speculative decoding methods available to compare with. Comparisons with these alternative approaches, such as REST, are crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation. \n\n* The choice of the probability threshold  for accepting draft tokens during verification significantly impacts CASD's performance. The sources acknowledge that a lower threshold can enhance accuracy with reliable contexts but might compromise fluency. However, the experiments primarily rely on fixed or manually tuned thresholds, which lack generalizability and require prior knowledge of the dataset characteristics. It would be better if the threshold could be determined automatically by a generalizable heuristic rule.\n\n* The setting of the vanilla decoding is unclear anywhere in this paper, i.e., temperature, sampling sizes, maximum context length and maximum generation token length. These can affect the model's performance and thus should be described in the experiments section."

The draft model in Speculative Decoding plays a crucial role in speeding up the method; relying on the original model for probabilities may yield only minor speed gains. Additionally, CASD may violate the traditional autoregressive decoding style since it accepts the longest draft, which may cause unwanted text behavior.\n\n3. **Limited baseline comparison**: The paper does not compare CASD with other prompting baselines such as the original SD. In addition, its experiments are conducted with only LLama.\n\n4. **Threshold sensitivity**: The results indicate that performance varies significantly with different threshold settings.\n\n5. **Limited writing**: The writing can be significantly improved. For example, the details of prompt compression are limited. It's unclear why using  LLMLingua-2 and it's unclear why it works."
