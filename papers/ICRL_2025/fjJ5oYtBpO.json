    "title": "Learning Molecular Symmetry Breaking via Symmetry-adapted Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "E(3)-equivariant neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in molecular modeling. However, the equivariance constraint limits the model's effectiveness in tasks involving symmetry breaking, particularly those that violate the celebrated Curie principle. Relaxing this constraint is essential for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we explore the intricate symmetry relationships between an object and its spontaneously symmetry-broken outcomes. We introduce a novel loss function to measure loss in ambiguous symmetry-breaking scenarios and propose a relaxed equivariance based on the molecule's inherent symmetries. Additionally, we develop SANN -- a symmetry-adapted neural network architecture that learns symmetry breaking through equivalence classes of atoms. SANN decomposes the molecular point cloud into sets of symmetry-equivalent atoms and performs message-passing both within and across these classes. We demonstrate the advantages of our method over invariant and equivariant models through synthetic tasks and show that SANN effectively learns both equivariance and symmetry breaking in various benchmark molecular modeling tasks.",

It introduces a novel loss function designed for SBB scenarios, which accounts for the inherent ambiguity in symmetry-breaking outcomes. To achieve relaxed equivariance, the paper proposes a specific canonicalization of the learnable model. Additionally, it presents a new message-passing framework, the Symmetry-Adapted Neural Network (SANN), that passes messages within and across sets of symmetry-equivalent atoms, respectively, followed by aggregation of information to capture the global features of molecules. Finally, several experiments on synthetic tasks are conducted, showing that SANN significantly outperforms the tested baselines.\n\nOverall, I recommend acceptance and would consider raising my score even further if the authors successfully address my feedback."

How would this measure be computed in such cases? Or does this paper only consider finite groups? This needs to be clarified in the discussion.\n* Although the paper is well-structured and provides essential foundational context, it lacks an explanation of why the proposed message-passing framework can address spontaneous symmetry breaking. This point requires further discussion in the paper.\n* The figures illustrating symmetry-breaking concepts are excellent.

For symmetric molecules, equivariance will force the output to have the symmetries as the input to the neural network, which sometimes limits the ability of a neural network to perform certain predictions. To tackle this problem, the authors propose to use adapted loss functions that are invariant to input stabilizers. They also suggest using relaxed equivariant prediction networks for this setting, which can be obtained through canonicalization. In practice, this is achieved with a canonicalization scheme based on asymmetric units. Experiments show that method used can break symmetries better than a combination of an equivariant neural network and an MLP and that the invariant loss helps significantly with learning."

                "value": "**Major**\n1. *Novelty and acknowledgment of previous work*\n- I think there is generally an issue with this paper in terms of claiming novelty for things that were proposed in previous works and correctly acknowledging previous contributions.\n- The most important case of this is the loss function Eq.3, which was already proposed and discussed by Xie and Smidt 2024. This is not acknowledged and is claimed to be an original contribution of the paper. The paper should be updated to not claim that this is an original contribution, and to correctly acknowledge Xie and Smidt 2024.\n- The paper \"Symmetry breaking and equivariant neural networks\" (Kaba and Ravanbakhsh 2023) introducing relaxed equivariance as a solution to the symmetry breaking problem is also not mentioned although related. It should be mentioned and discussed.\n- It also seems to me that there are instances in the paper where appropriate citations is not given to the right papers. For example, Baker et al. 2024 did not introduce either canonicalization or relaxed equivariance, yet the way in which the paper is cited seems to suggests that.\n- I generally suggest to expand the related works section to discuss what solutions were previously proposed to the symmetry breaking problem and how the proposed one differentiates itself from these methods. For example, it is said that \"[other] approaches are not applicable to learning symmetry breaking\". What does that mean and how is that so, given the proposed method is based on canonicalization which is one of these other approaches?\n2. *Incomplete experimental evaluation*\n- I found that the baselines specifications was incomplete. I did not see explained in the paper what SchNet + MLP or EGNN + MLP means in terms of implementation. The fact that these models struggle on all tasks seems to indicate that they are simply not appropriate baselines. I suggest that the authors instead compare with Hofgard 2024 et al. or Lawrence et al. 2024 instead.\n- An simple baseline that the should be compared against is simply symmetry breaking by adding noise to the inputs and then using an equivariant neural network.\n3. *Regarding the method*\n- The loss eq.3 seems of limited usefulness in practice. First it requires to find the stabilizer of all inputs, which may be costly. Second, and more importantly, its computation involves a potentially expensive optimization procedure especially if the stabilizer is large. Note that these limitations were already mentioned by Xie and Smidt 2024, I therefore find surprising that they are not at least discussed here. I think these limitations should be discussed as well as providing an analysis of computational cost.\n\n**Minor**\n- I did not find Figure 2 completely clear, what symmetry exactly is broken?\n- The introduction mentions \"crystal material melting\" as an example of symmetry breaking. I think this is confusing/not accurate. Melting restores symmetry and does not break it. I suggest the authors precise this or use another example instead.\n- Section 6.1 mentions \"the Heisenberg uncertainty principle\" as reason for why molecules are in constant motion and why the normal modes are of interest. I don't think that this is accurate, I suggest that the authors remove this reference."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- I don't understand exactly why EMD was chosen as loss function and how it is computed.\n- Could the authors explain how the QM7-X dataset was curated. What proportion of the data was retained? How does the method compare with baselines on the full dataset?\n- As discussed in the paper and in previous work, canonicalization is sufficient to break symmetry. The additional clustering procedure based on equivalence classes is therefore not related to the symmetry breaking problem. I am therefore questioning the necessity of that design choice, what is the motivation? It is also necessary to perform ablation studies to understand the impact of that choice on result compared to simply using a message passing scheme.\n- The term \"non-functional\" is used a few times? What is meant by that?\n- I find the first paragraph of page 5 confusing. In particular, the statement \"these outputs shared the same reduced symmetry\" is not clear since the symmetry groups are not the same. They are conjugate, but that is the case for any objects in the same orbit. The fact that the rectangles in the example share the same symmetry is an accident, you could imagine a similar example with triangles where this would not be true anymore."
