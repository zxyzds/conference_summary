    "abstract": "To bridge the gap between perception and planning in traditional navigation systems, we address the challenge of learning optimal trajectories directly from depth information in an end-to-end fashion. Using neural networks as black-box replacements for traditional modules can compromise robustness and stability. Moreover, such methods often fail to adequately account for the robot's kinematic constraints, leading to trajectories that may not be satisfactorily executable. In this paper, we integrate the strengths of conventional methods and neural networks by introducing an optimization-embedded neural network based on a compact trajectory library. Neural networks establish spatial constraints for model-based trajectory planning, followed by robust numerical optimization to achieve feasible and optimal solutions.  By making the process differentiable, our model seamlessly approximates the optimal trajectory. Additionally, the introduction of a regularized trajectory library enables the method to efficiently capture the spatial distribution of optimal trajectories with minimal storage cost, ensuring multimodal planning characteristics. Evaluations in complex, unseen environments demonstrate our method\u2019s superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms. Real-world flight experiments with a small onboard computer showcase the autonomous quadrotor\u2019s ability to navigate swiftly through dense forests.",

                "value": "The authors propose an end-to-end depth map paradigm for agile collision avoidance in the context of quadrotor flight. The approach relies on coupled training of the output trajectory mixture distribution over pre-identified primitives and the embedded trajectory optimization differentiable layer. The latter responds to input data to change the geometric space constraints (safe corridor as sequence of spheres). Demonstrations of performance in simulation as well as in the real world are provided to back the authors' claims."

What ways would you see forward to solve this? \n    - Is this behind the collisions accounting for the scores in the more aggressive settings or are there any other failure mode reasons?\n    - This lacks a study of the effect of increasing N on the model complexity/optimization time, as well as on performance (safety, jerk and velocity)\n\n- What was the tuning process for the loss weights (appendix B2)?\n\n- Is any checking done on biases within the trajectory primitive library (is it balanced, does it average to a straight line from start to goal?)\n\n- How much harder would the authors expect it to be to achieve similar results with RGB camera only?"

The authors combine the strengths of both frameworks, using training data of traditional map-based methods to train the network to avoid using map in the applications. The core contribution is innovatively incorporating the optimization module into the network and the cost function of the trajectory optimization as a part of the loss function, achieving good performance.

The key idea is to use an optimizer which is differentiable, and can be plugged in with learning methods. Such methods have been existing in robotic literature, and the current paper uses that idea.
