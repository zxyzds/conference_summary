    "title": "DiffMove: Human Trajectory Recovery via Conditional Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "Recovering human trajectories from incomplete or missing data is crucial for many mobility-based urban applications, e.g., urban planning, transportation, and location-based services. Existing methods mainly rely on recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms. Though promising, they encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies in low-sampling trajectories. Recently, diffusion models show potential in content generation. However, most of proposed methods are used to generate contents in continuous numerical representations, which cannot be directly adapted to the human location trajectory recovery. In this paper, we introduce a conditional diffusion-based trajectory recovery method, namely, DiffMove. It first transforms locations in trajectories into the embedding space, in which the embedding denoising is performed, and then missing locations are recovered by an embedding decoder. DiffMove not only improves accuracy by introducing high-quality generative methods in the trajectory recovery, but also carefully models the transition, periodicity, and temporal patterns in human mobility. Extensive experiments based on two representative real-world mobility datasets are conducted, and the results show significant improvements (an average of 11% in recall) over the baselines.",

The model uses multiple losses to learn: 1) the trajectory location encoder that projects raw points to effective trajectory embeddings, 2) the conditional embedding denoiser that generates the target trajectory location embedding with the help of historical and current trajectory embeddings, and 3) the final embedding decoder to map the denoised embeddings back to their locations.\n\nExtensive experiments have demonstrated the SOTA performances of DiffMove on both GPS and check-in trajectories, strong robustness against various historical trajectory location missing rates, and efficacy of main model components by ablation studies. It would be better if there were visualizations and efficiency analysis."

                "value": "The task of this manuscript is the imputation of human mobility trajectory data. Two challenges are proposed: (1) Traditional diffusion models aim for imputation of continuous numerical values, which can be directly obtained through denoising. In contrast, the goal of trajectory recovery is to represent locations as discrete IDs, allowing for a fuller utilization of the transitional and periodic patterns of human trajectories. (2) Besides the temporal dependencies of the current sample, the denoising process should also consider the transitional and periodic dependencies between the current sample and historical samples. To address these challenges, this manuscript introduces DiffMove. To tackle the first challenge, DiffMove converts discrete trajectories into an embedding space, inferring the embedding representations of missing locations through conditional diffusion, and then passing them to a Missing Location Decoder to obtain location IDs. To address the second challenge, DiffMove designs a Spatial Conditional Block based on graph neural network and attention mechanism to learn the spatial transitional and periodic patterns of both current and historical trajectories. Additionally, a Target Conditional Block is introduced to extract knowledge of the missing locations of the current trajectory from historical trajectories. Experiments conducted on two mobility datasets (Geolife and Foursquare) show that DiffMove outperforms the baseline by an average of 11% in recall rate."

                "value": "1. I find the framing of the problem regarding human trajectory recovery in this paper somewhat debatable. As outlined in Definition 3.1, each trajectory point signifies a location visited by a user within a specific time frame (of 30 minutes). A point is considered missing if the location isn't observed during that interval. There are two scenarios where this approach might be inappropriate:\n    - When a user visits a location, such as a movie theater, and remains there for an extended period, it is expected that they won't visit other locations during subsequent intervals. These should not be marked as missing locations. If these intervals are instead recorded as the location where the user stayed, two questions arise: 1) Practically speaking, how can we determine how long a user stayed at one location when such data is typically not available in check-in datasets like FourSquare? 2) The trajectory would consist of consecutive repetitive locations, making recovery quite trivial.\n    - If a user visits a location (e.g., fast food restaurant) and then moves to another within minutes, the 30-minute interval may not accurately capture their movements.\n\n2. The paper's motivation could be articulated more effectively. In the introduction, it states that there are \"limitations in complex sparse, irregular, and uncertain scenarios inherently in human mobility,\" which is somewhat vague. This does not clearly illustrate how these limitations are tackled by the proposed method. Furthermore, claims like \"traditional methods typically provide a biased deterministic imputed trajectory\" suggest an intention to highlight probabilistic generation's advantages over deterministic methods; however, the proposed approach neither focuses on probabilistic generation nor evaluates this aspect experimentally.\n\n3. The proposed method lacks substantial novelty in its design. The challenge presented\u2014\"the imputation targets of conventional diffusion models are continuous numerical values\"\u2014and the solution of mapping discrete location indices into continuous embedding space appear standard given existing latent diffusion [1-2] and discrete diffusion [3] solutions. Integrating historical and recent trajectory information via Spatial Conditional Block seems straightforward and primarily involves combining existing components.\n\n4. The paper's illustrations could be clearer. Specifically, components in Figure 1 lacks appropriate labels, leading to vague references such as \"the blue and white location icons in trajectories\" and \"shown in the top right part of Figure 1.\" This can cause potential confusion for readers.\n\n5. I recommend including comparisons or discussions on some missing related works regarding human mobility trajectory recovery methods; certain comparison methods [4] could be addressed here. While recognizing that settings differ slightly on trajectory recovery, discussing GPS trajectory recovery/imputation methods [5-6] might also prove beneficial.\n\n\n[1] Li, Xiang, et al. \"Diffusion-lm improves controllable text generation.\"\u00a0_Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems_\u00a035 (2022): 4328-4343.\n\n[2] Lovelace, Justin, et al. \"Latent diffusion for language generation.\"\u00a0_Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems_\u00a036 (2024).\n\n[3] Lou, Aaron, Chenlin Meng, and Stefano Ermon. \"Discrete Diffusion Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution.\"\u00a0_Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning_.\n\n[4] Xi, Dongbo, et al. \"Modelling of bi-directional spatio-temporal dependence and users\u2019 dynamic preferences for missing poi check-in identification.\"\u00a0_Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence_.
