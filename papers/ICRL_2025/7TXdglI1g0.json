    "title": "Efficient Bisection Projection to Ensure NN Solution Feasibility for Optimization over General Set",
    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) have shown promise in solving constrained optimization problems in real-time. However, ensuring that NN-generated solutions strictly adhere to constraints is challenging due to NN prediction errors. Recent methods have achieved feasibility guarantees over ball-homeomorphic sets with low complexity and bounded optimality loss, yet extending these guarantees to more general sets remains largely open. \nIn this paper, we develop **Bisection Projection**, an efficient approach to ensure NN solution feasibility for optimization over general compact sets with non-empty interiors, irrespective of their ball-homeomorphic properties. \nOur method begins by identifying multiple interior points (IPs) within the constraint set, chosen based on their eccentricity modulated by the NN infeasibility region. \nWe utilize another unsupervised-trained NN (called IPNN) to map inputs to these interior points, thereby reducing the complexity of computing these IPs in run-time.\nFor NN solutions initially deemed infeasible, we apply a bisection procedure that adjusts these solutions towards the identified interior points, ensuring feasibility with minor projection-induced optimality loss. We prove the feasibility guarantee and bound the optimality loss of our approach under mild conditions. \nExtensive simulations, including non-convex optimal power flow problems in large-scale networks, demonstrate that bisection projection outperforms existing methods in solution feasibility and computational efficiency with comparable optimality losses.",

[LCL23]\n* The paper mentions several times that the proposed method guarantees feasibility for general sets (this claim is repeated twice at the end of Section 1).\n\tThis is not a valid claim: the proposed method only produces feasible solutions on the condition that an interior point is available. The paper does not provide a guarantee that this assumption is always met in practice.\n* The paper should cite the following reference: _A New Computationally Simple Approach for Implementing\nNeural Networks with Output Hard Constraints_ (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10459).\n* The eccentricity metric in Definition 4.1 assumes the feasible set to be compact, and therefore bounded.\n\tThis eliminates a large set of problems for which the feasible set may be unbounded.\n* The result of Proposition 4.1 assumes the availability of a trained model with arbitrary accuracy \n* Theorem 1:\n\t* The sample-based condition assumes an $r_{c}$-covering dataset. In general, this requires an exponential number of data points (expoential w.r.t input dimension), and an infinite number of points if $\\Theta$ has unbounded support.\n\t* The sample-based condition uses three constants which should be defined in the main body of the paper, as they are important for the proof and the value of the result.\n\t\tIn particular, constant $C_{0}$ (which is only defined in the appendix) depends on the rate of variation of the constraint boundary w.r.t $\\theta$.\n\t\tThis constant may be infinite, for instance, with the following set: $C_{\\theta} = ([0, 1] \\cup [2, 3]) \\cap ([0, \\theta])$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 3$. Note that this set is representable using the following polynominal constraints $x (x-1) (x-2) (x-3) \\leq 0, 0 \\leq x \\leq \\theta$.\n\t\tThe boundary \"jumps\" when $\\theta$ crosses the value $\\theta = 2$.\n\t* The sample efficiency of the sample-based condition is not better than sampling $O(1/L^d)$ points, where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the ground-truth mapping from input data to ground-truth solution.\n    * The verification-based condition merely re-states the definition of a feasible point.\n\tIt also requires solving a neural network verification problem, which is computationally intractable in practice.\n\tWhile relaxing integrality in the verification problem does provide a valid bound, there is no guarantee that it will be strong enough to validate the claim of Theorem 1.\n* Proposition 5.1: the proposition again assumes a compact feasible set, and the bound on eccentricity is valid only for a single $\\theta$.\n\tTherefore, the number of interior-points should be denoted as $m(\\theta)$, and may be unbounded w.r.t $\\theta$ to obtain satisfactory accuracy. \n\tAlso note that the bound on $m$ is not asymptotically better than simply splitting the space intohyperboxes that cover the set $C_{\\theta}$.\n\n### Experiments\n\n* Convex QCQPs and SOCP are equivalent problem classes\n* The data generation methodology for instances considered in the experiments is not presented.\n\tThe paper should present a complete description of each problem **and** the data generation used to generate instances.\n* Chance constraints of the form $P[Ax \\geq \\theta + \\omega] \\geq 1 - \\delta$, where $\\omega$ is Gaussian, are _convex_ and can be represented with a second-order cone constraint.\n\tThis biases the results of the experiment\n* Table 5 (verification-based IPNN performance) does not include AC-OPF instances.\n* Instances with 200 nodes are not representative of real-life power systems.\n\tExperiments should be conducted on power grids with at least 6000 nodes."
