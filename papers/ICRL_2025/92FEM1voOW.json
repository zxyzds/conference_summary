    "abstract": "Consistency Models (CM) have significantly accelerated the sampling process in diffusion models, yielding impressive results in synthesizing high-resolution images. \nTo explore and extend these advancements to point-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Latent Points Consistency Model (MLPCM). \nOur MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework and introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from point-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial resolution. \nWe design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D spatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations conditioned on those from multiple super-point levels.\nAdditionally, we propose a latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that compresses the prior into a one-step generator.\nThis significantly improves sampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher model. \nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol demonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and diversity.",

Using a two-stage approach that first trains a hierarchical VAE to learn a hierarchical latent distribution from point-level to shape-level latent, a conditional diffusion model is then trained to sample the point-level latent with the information of the latent from a coarser level. Network architectures including a Multi-Scale Latent Integration and a  3D Spatial Attention Mechanism are used in the denoiser network to improve the sampling performance. A consistency model is further fit to sample efficiently from the diffusion model in a few steps. The paper shows impressive quantitative generation results compared to competitive baselines. Also, with the consistency model, the paper shows significant generation speed-up using the consistency model with minimal qualitative degradation. The ablation study also shows the importance of the hierarchical latent representation and the proposed network architecture."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main claim is that the method enables point-cloud generation with a consistency model. However, it seems that the authors simply use the existing formulation of the consistency model without any modification. So why is this part a technical contribution of the paper? Why can't previous works like LION also incorporate a consistency model to speed up their diffusion sampling? While the sampling time comparison is impressive, the baseline LION only uses DDIM sampling. It would be great if the authors could clarify why the proposed method is better suited for consistency models than existing works.  \n2. The novelty of the proposed approach is limited. Hierarchical latent representation is not new and is explored in many other works to show improvement. The only modification of the proposed work from LION seems to be the usage of multiple latent hierarchies and the consistency model. However, for example, the recent CVPR 2025 paper XCube [1] also uses a hierarchical representation to improve generation results for large scenes. Consistency models can also be trained for these works to improve efficiency. The proposed network modifications are also not novel. The multi-scale latent integration looks similar to the AdaIn layer proposed in StyleGAN [2] and the spatial attention module is just an attention module with relative positional embedding. \n3. Not enough qualitative examples. It seems that the supplementary is missing despite the promise in the paper of an appendix (c.f. ln 237). The paper only has one qualitative visual and they do not look impressive. Qualitative comparison with baselines should be provided. \n4. It's not clear what the application that this method enables. Similar to LION, the method can only generate 2048 points for each of the shapes, and I'm not sure why this would be helpful for downstream applications, given the sparsity of the points. While LION did the same, they also had a downstream pipeline that could convert the point samples to meshes. I wonder if this method can do the same. Otherwise, it would be great if the authors could provide some applications enabled by this method. \n\n[1] Xuanchi Ren, Jiahui Huang, Xiaohui Zeng, Ken Museth, Sanja Fidler, & Francis Williams.

Adding a conditioning approach, such as a voxel-based method similar to LION, could enable true interactivity and align better with the paper\u2019s claims. It would also be interesting to see if the distillation process holds up under conditioning or guidance techniques.\n\n**Minor:**  \n3.

                "value": "1. I didn't fully understand the explanation or motivations behind the MLI layer. Specifically, the choice to use latents to modulate features \\( F_s \\) lacks clear motivation. Additionally, the role of the two-dimensional scales isn\u2019t clarified. More context on why this design was chosen would help.\n2. The explanation of the VAE's latent variable structure is confusing, especially with respect to the latent numbering and the statement \\( N_0 = N \\). Equation (1) seems to indicate that \\( X \\) is encoded to \\( Z^L \\) rather than \\( Z_0 \\), which is contradictory. The figure also suggests that latents emerge from the encoder bottleneck, which does not match the text and adds to the confusion.\n3. Figure 2 doesn\u2019t show where MLI layers fit within the architecture, making it hard to follow their integration.\n4. The bias term explanation is unclear. Since \\( B \\) is a distance matrix, it should be minimal for nearby points, but adding it as a dense map to the attention score would seem to emphasize distant points instead of close ones. Some clarification here would help."

This is mostly fine but makes me not get super excited about the paper but as I mentioned earlier, this is a step toward the right direction. \n\nIn fact, the two other contributions: 3D self attention and hierarchical point representation does not seem to help much. It is better to have only PL in Table 5 to have a better picture. It seems that the heavy lifting is done by PL and the rest just make the results slightly better, which is expected as PL has more info about the shape. But then, I am asking myself, the core contribution is really just consistency models applied on point clouds and others are marginal improvements. \n\nIt seems that the paper was written in rush. There are very few qualitative results and from the caption of Fig 3, it is not clear if the results are made in one step, through a teacher model or anything else. While, there is still space left in the paper, authors decided not to put more qualitative results under different settings and validate their work. Also, line 237 refers to the appendix but I was not able to find any appendix. Captions of the figures are also not expressive enough. For example caption of Fig 1 does not explain the components in the figure. Also, caption of fig 2 does not have explanation of the components. This is not a good practice in general.\n\nThere are also typos here and there e.g., line 98 were were, and line 71, exiting-> existing. \n\nAll in all, I am not very negative about the paper but I am not also very excited.
