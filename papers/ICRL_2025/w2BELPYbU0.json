    "title": "I-Max: Maximize the Resolution Potential of Pre-trained Rectified Flow Transformers with Projected Flow",
    "abstract": "Rectified Flow Transformers (RFTs) offer superior training and inference efficiency, making them likely the most viable direction for scaling up diffusion models. However, progress in generation resolution has been relatively slow due to data quality and training costs. Tuning-free resolution extrapolation presents an alternative, but current methods often reduce generative stability, limiting practical application. In this paper, we review existing resolution extrapolation methods and introduce the I-Max framework to maximize the resolution potential of Text-to-Image RFTs. I-Max features: (i) a novel Projected Flow strategy for stable extrapolation and (ii) an advanced inference toolkit for generalizing model knowledge to higher resolutions. Experiments with Lumina-Next-2K and Flux.1-dev demonstrate I-Max's ability to enhance stability in resolution extrapolation and show that it can bring image detail emergence and artifact correction, confirming the practical value of tuning-free resolution extrapolation.",

While directly training high-resolution generative models is practically difficult, this paper aims to adapt trained RFTs to generate images of high resolutions (such as 4096X4096) without the need for fine tuning.\n\nThe proposed scheme named I-Max involves low-resolution guidance named projected flow. Here, the low-resolution\nspace is treated as a low-dimensional projection of the high-resolution space, and thereby the low-resolution\nflow can be regarded as the projection of the ideal high-resolution flow. Considering the linear\ninterpolation characteristic of rectified flow, I-Max incorporates guidance in the projected space at each timestep.\nAdditionally I-max incorporates inference techniques tailored for RFT to enhance the model\u2019s ability to generalize to extrapolated resolution."

More qualitative examples wherein one can see improvements as shown in Fig 2 could have been shown in the supplementary material.
