    "title": "MaskTwins: Dual-form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency regularization in unsupervised domain adaptation. However, they merely treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective learning strategy that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.",

In particular, i find it noteworthy that the proposed methodology is effective on 3D input (synapse detection), in which it is generally notoriously hard to stabilise UDA training.\n* The evaluation is thorough and includes comparisons to a wide range of UDA baselines.\n* The theoretical foundation is sufficient for the study\u2019s objectives, but could be strengthened to enhance rigor."

Instead the theoretical results relate the methodology to a naive masking strategy, which might still provide benefits over other methodologies. \n\n* Second, the ablation study does not study the effectiveness of individual parts of the methodology. I find that it is central to include a comparison to a simpler masking strategy, such as the random baseline from the theoretical analysis and to study the impact of each element in the loss. Instead the authors choose to only ablate details on the patch size, mask type and masking ratio.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Shai Ben-David, John Blitzer, Koby Crammer, and Fernando Pereira.

The overall framework is based on many well-structured techniques, such as AdaIN, EMA-based pseudo label, consistency learning loss, and so on. There lacks an effective ablation study to clarify the gain that is actually taken by the envisioned dual-form complementary masked method. In the ablation study section, only the patch size and the mask type and mask ratio are reported. \n\n-- The contribution is a bit incremental and over-claimed. At a high level, the envisioned dual-form complementary masked method can be regarded as the constrained entropy minimization like MEMO (Test Time Robustness via Adaptation and Augmentation) . Meanwhile, it seems that the proposed dual-form complementary masked method can also be applied to general classification problem, where we can mask the image in a same manner.  This can verify the authors' first contribution, \"This perspective bridges the gap between masked image modeling and signal processing theory, potentially opening new avenues for future research\". Applying the proposed method to more general tasks can further show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n-- In the introduction section, the authors clarify that \"This insight is grounded in the principles of compressed sensing\" and \"We provide a theoretical foundation for masked reconstruction by reframing it as a sparse signal reconstruction issue\". However, in the method section, there is no any presentation about these descriptions, which is very vague. Authors may reorganize the manuscript carefully."
