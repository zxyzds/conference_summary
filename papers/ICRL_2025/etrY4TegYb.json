    "title": "Learning Relational Invariance for Out-of-Distribution Molecular Relational Learning",
    "abstract": "Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) expands the scope of molecular representation learning by incorporating additional molecules, aiming to understand  the interactions between pairs of molecules. While MRL has shown promising results, the existing methods have not been able to generalise to real world scenarios. Invariant learning is pivotal in addressing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization challenges. However, two major obstacles impede the progress of invariant learning in MRL: (1) Unlike single-molecular cases, interactions between molecules introduce added complexity, with a heavy reliance on molecular substructure recognition, often leading to the misspecification of invariant patterns. (2) Accurate modeling of interactions can effectively improve generalizations. However, previous methods focus on node interaction, which is limited by the expressiveness of GNN, and long-range interactions cannot be captured. To address these, we propose a novel Relational Invariant Learning (RIL) framework that  uses a multi-granularity interaction approach to improve OOD generalization for MRL, and the framework is denoted as RILOOD. Specifically,  we model the environment diversity distribution of molecules by mixup-based Conditional Modeling. Then, we employ a multi-granularity refinement strategy to learn the Context-Aware Representation, which is essential for capturing multi-level interaction. We further design an invariant learning module to capture the invariant patterns that robustly generalize across unseen environments. Extensive experiments on molecular datasets show that our method achieves stronger generalization against state-of-the-art methods in the presence of various distribution shifts. Our code will be released after our paper is accepted.",

Why is the solute feature being referred to as a spurious correlation?\n\nEven if, as the authors claim, CMRL injects noise into the representation space, this paper also performs reconstruction in the representation space without imposing specific constraints or conditions on the functional group. Therefore, it is not significantly different from CMRL.\n\n- Assumption Section\n\nIt is stated that the (G_1, G_2) pair is related to the surrounding environment of K, but what examples are there of the surrounding environment? In the modeling section (lines 251-253), it is stated that the solvent is the environment, and it seems that the solvent acts as the environment in the modeling section as well.\n\n- Experiment Section\n\nA more detailed explanation of the experimental setup is needed. For example, Solvent, Scaffold, Assay, and Size seem to be methods of data splitting, but how were these obtained?\nThe settings vary slightly for each experiment, and it needs to be clarified why that is. For example, in Table 1, CompSolv experiments on Assay, Size, and Scaffold splits, while in Table 2, experiments are conducted on Size, Scaffold, Solvent, and Assay.\n\n- No codes are provided, raising question on reproducibility of this work."

Table 4 presents the performance differences of various baselines under iid and ood conditions, but these baselines are designed to varying degrees for ood problems. Results for simple backbones, such as the GCN shown in Table 1, should be supplemented.\n- Molecular compatibility is highly related to molecular conformation and polarity [1]. This information should not be difficult to learn when given 3D molecular inputs. To strengthen the evaluation, consider demonstrating the performance gap between iid and ood splits using 3D molecular encoders like Uni-mol [3], which can capture conformation and polarity information.\n\n## Experiment Analysis\n\n- Fig. 3 (c) lacks corresponding analysis.\n- What is EAIL in Fig. 3 (b)?\n- The performance metrics in Table 4 for the CompSolv dataset do not align with those presented in Table 1.\n- As shown in Table 2, after adding $\\mathcal{L}\\_{inv}+\\mathcal{L}\\_{MI}+\\mathcal{L}\\_{CVAE}$ and removing MCAR from the baseline, the performance declined. Does this imply that the loss function proposed in this paper leads to a performance degradation,  or that the authors have not accurately reported the experimental results?\n\n##  Chemical Interpretability\n\n- The solubility of molecules has been established to be strongly correlated with properties such as molecular polarity [1]. The authors should supplement the manuscript with relevant experiments or visualizations to demonstrate that the model has indeed captured the strong correlation between polarity and solubility. Otherwise, it remains possible that the model has learned a spurious correlation.\n- Additional baselines should be included: [2]. Furthermore, a baseline utilizing DFT calculations or COSMO-RS to compute the Free Energy of Solvation should also be included, given that the dataset is not excessively large so that calculations are feasible.\n\n# Minor Concerns\n\n- This paper introduces a framework that should be compatible with various backbones. However, the experiments in this paper are only conducted on one type of backbone. If time and computational resources permit, we would like the authors to explore the improvements brought by the proposed framework on different backbones.\n\n**If the authors can address all my major concerns, I would be pleased to raise the score.**\n\n# Reference\n\n[1] Anslyn E V.
