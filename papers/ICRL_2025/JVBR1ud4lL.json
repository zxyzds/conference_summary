    "abstract": "As the cost of training large language models (LLMs) rises, protecting their intellectual property has become increasingly critical. Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks, presents a growing risk of unauthorized and malicious usage.\nWhile fingerprinting techniques have been studied for asserting model ownership, existing methods have primarily focused on fine-tuning, leaving model merging underexplored.\nTo address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method MergePrint that embeds robust fingerprints designed to preserve ownership claims even after model merging.\nBy optimizing against a pseudo-merged model, which simulates post-merged model weights, MergePrint generates fingerprints that remain detectable after merging.\nAdditionally, we optimize the fingerprint inputs to minimize performance degradation, enabling verification through specific outputs from targeted inputs. \nThis approach provides a practical fingerprinting strategy for asserting ownership in cases of misappropriation through model merging.",

                "value": "This paper presents MERGEPRINT, a fingerprinting method for large language models (LLMs) aimed at protecting against unauthorized use via model merging. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on fine-tuning, MERGEPRINT embeds resilient fingerprints specifically designed to persist through merging. By using a pseudo-merged model to simulate post-merge conditions, MERGEPRINT generates optimized input-output fingerprint pairs that remain detectable post-merging. The two-step optimization process for inputs and parameters minimizes performance loss and ensures reliable fingerprint retention across merging ratios. Experiments confirm MERGEPRINT\u2019s effectiveness and robustness, with high fingerprint retention and minimal impact on model performance."

It would be valuable to understand how the method performs with multiple models and multiple fingerprints.\n- There is a lack of experiments addressing basic adversarial attacks, such as an overwriting attack by adversaries.\n- The explanation for the choice of regularization coefficient $lambda$ and the two merging coefficients is limited to the methodology section, with no experimental analysis on these parameters in the results section."

The authors do not utilize formal methods or cryptographic techniques, which could strengthen the credibility of the ownership claims.\n3. **Efficiency Trade-offs**: While the paper claims that the fingerprinting procedure is efficient, the trade-off between efficiency and robustness is not thoroughly explored. For instance, the use of a low learning rate (1e-6) and the early stopping approach might lead to suboptimal results in some scenarios.\n4. **Generalizability**: The paper does not provide extensive evaluations across a diverse range of models and merging scenarios. The effectiveness of MERGEPRINT in more complex and varied environments remains uncertain.\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The paper mentions the potential for malicious exploitation of the embedded secret information, but it does not delve deeply into the ethical implications and safeguards needed to prevent such misuse."

For example, the authors only talk about prior works on black-box model fingerprinting in Section 1.1. There are also a lot of works that embed fingerprints in the model weights (i.e., white-box setting). Furthermore, the problem of model ownership proof against model merging is more similar to model watermarking/fingerprinting in the federated learning setting (which has model aggregation that is similar to model merging). The authors should discuss the similarities and differences between the prior works in the FL setting and the one in this paper. \n- The evaluation seems to be incomprehensive. For example, Section 5.2 mentions that the fingerprint y='transformers' in the model. It's not clear whether the performance of MergePrint is impacted by y. Also, the optimized fingerprint input x is not given."

                "value": "1. Missing important related works. The method of this paper is a backdoor-based model ownership verification method that intends to embed a specific behavior into the model. However, there have been some works investigating backdoor attacks against model merge (e.g., [1]). There are also many works focusing on watermarking LLMs in ways other than weight watermarking [2,3,4]. It may be better for the authors to include a discussion on these related works.\n2. Missing optimization details. This paper proposes a two-step optimization. However, it is not clear whether the two steps are performed alternatively in each epoch or whether the second step will be performed after the first one is completed. Additionally, this paper lacks a detailed description of the experimental settings, including the hyperparameters and the hardware.\n3. Missing hyperparameter study. This paper introduces two important hyperparameters, $\\alpha_x$ and $\\alpha_w$. These two hyperparameters may have a great impact on the effectiveness of this paper. The authors should present a hyperparameter study to investigate the impact of these hyperparameters.\n4. Insufficient ablation study. This paper presents the ablation study of the input optimization step. The authors should also conduct an ablation study on the parameter optimization step. Also, it may be better to investigate the effect of the pseudo-merged model (i.e., perform the two-step optimization only on the fine-tuned model).\n5. The robustness of the fingerprint is not guaranteed. Although MergePrint is robust against model merge and the authors claim that fine-tuning is out of the scope, it does not mean that fine-tuning is not important in the real-world scenario. I highly recommend the authors conduct a study of the robustness of MergePrint against a wide range of attacks, such as fine-tuning, pruning, and distillation. If MergePrint can not resist these attacks, it should be noted as a limitation of this paper.\n6. Insufficient analysis of efficiency. The authors should report the time or the time complexity of MergePrint to help the readers better understand its efficiency.\n7. Typos and grammatical mistakes. There are some typos and grammatical mistakes in this paper (e.g., lines 223-224). It may be better for the authors to proofread the paper and correct potential mistakes.\n\n[1] BadMerging: Backdoor Attacks Against Model Merging.\n\n[2] PLMmark: A Secure and Robust Black-Box Watermarking Framework for Pre-trained Language Models.\n\n[3] Explanation as a Watermark: Towards Harmless and Multi-bit Model Ownership Verification via Watermarking Feature Attribution.\n\n[4] Watermarking Techniques for Large Language Models: A Survey."
