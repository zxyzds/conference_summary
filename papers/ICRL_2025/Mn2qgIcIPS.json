    "abstract": "Low-light image enhancement poses a significant challenge due to the limited information captured by image sensors in low-light environments. \n  Despite recent improvements in deep learning models, the lack of paired training datasets remains a significant obstacle. \n  Therefore, unsupervised methods have emerged as a promising solution. \n  In this work, we focus on the strength of curve-adjustment-based approaches to tackle unsupervised methods. \n  The majority of existing unsupervised curve-adjustment approaches iteratively estimate higher order curve parameters to enhance the exposure of images while efficiently preserving the details of the images. \n  However, the convergence of the enhancement procedure cannot be guaranteed, leading to sensitivity to the number of iterations and limited performance.\n  To address this problem, we consider the iterative curve-adjustment update process as a dynamic system and formulate it as a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) for the first time, and this allows us to learn a continuous dynamics of the latent image. \n  The strategy of utilizing NODE to leverage continuous dynamics in iterative methods enhances unsupervised learning and aids in achieving better convergence compared to discrete-space approaches. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised low-light image enhancement across various benchmark datasets.",

                "value": "- Thank you for taking the time to review our paper and for providing your feedback.We would like to kindly note that we have included all the benchmark experiments typically conducted in low-light image enhancement. \n- In Table 2, we present results on the complex SICE dataset using various metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Unlike methods that measure performance with only a specific exposure from the SICE dataset, we leverage all available exposures to evaluate full complex scenarios. As a result, our method demonstrates performance on par with supervised learning approaches in these challenging SICE scenarios.\n- However, the current request outlined in your review seems a bit ambiguous.  We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide more specific details regarding additional experiments or analyses you would like to see. This would help us address your concerns effectively during the discussion period. Additionally, **we would be grateful if you could provide clearer reasons for the strong rejection recommendation**, as this would help us better understand your perspective and improve our work."

In my opinion, the author's comparative experiment is still not sufficient. It should be compared on more real benchmarks to highlight the superiority of the method. The current comparison seems to be insufficient, including the following:\n\n[1] Contrast enhancement based on layered difference representation.\n\n[2] Perceptual quality assessment for multi-exposure image fusion.\n\n[3] Structure-revealing low-light image enhancement via robust retinex model.\n\n[4] Naturalness preserved enhancement algorithm for non-uniform illumination images.\n\n[5] On the evaluation of illumination compensation algorithms.\n\n4. There are many different paradigms for unsupervised methods. Compared with this type of method, is the author's method more scalable?

Conclusion should be improved although I can understand there is a space limitation. Please make other parts smaller and add some key findings in conclusions.\n5. Some more recent references from 2024 is required.\n\nBy framing the enhancement process as a Neural ODE, CLODE relies on numerical approximation methods (e.g., dopri5) that inherently carry approximation errors. This can provide solvers with adaptive step sizes but they cannot guarantee analytical precision or stability across all image conditions, particularly in complex cases with high dynamic ranges. This approximation could lead to unpredictable or suboptimal results, especially when the integration steps or the neural network's learned parameters are insufficiently fine-tuned for certain low-light conditions. Can the authors provide some low-light images from real-world dark conditions and demonstrate the method."

Manual adjustment of exposure intervals introduces subjectivity. An ablation can give us more insights.\n\n4. NODE-based adjustments may struggle with high-dynamic-range images, risking instability and suboptimal exposure adjustments. Can you provide the separate loss curves for better understanding of the training dynamics."
