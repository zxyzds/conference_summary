    "title": "ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human-controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.",

The authors observe that the next-token-prediction loss fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with down-stream task performance for task specific instruction tuning.

The authors claim that the validation loss fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with the target task performance, which is counter-intuitive in machine learning theory. It would be better to provide more support evidence in the introduction section, such as experimental table etc. \n\n2. The relationship between pairwise preference loss and win rate depicted in Figure3 is insufficient to substantiate the claim of \"a more consistent correlation between reduced validation loss and increased test win rates\". \n\n3. The paper lacks experiments examining the influence of pairwise preference pairs in the validation dataset, which are crucial because the entire framework is grounded in DPO theory.\n\n4. It would enhance the paper to display the performance curve as the number of selected training data increases, ranging from 5% to 100%.\n\n5. The method's reliance on a pairwise preference validation dataset to calculate the influence score for each training sample is burdensome. Moreover, if a preference dataset can be identified or constructed, why not train the model directly on it?\n\n6. If I understand the main point of the paper correctly, the authors suggest that the distribution mismatch between training and test data results in a misalignment between loss and target task performance. To ensure precision and avoid ambiguity, the authors should be more careful with their wording. For instance, the statement \"it is widely acknowledged that next-token prediction loss often fails to accurately reflect a model\u2019s real-world performance\" should specify that this discrepancy arises due to the violation of the i.i.d. assumption."

From what I understand, SimPO normalizes the loss by sequence length, yet the proposed method in the paper continues to use the original DPO loss.\n\n2. The connection between the Influence Estimation Scheme and the ROSE optimization objective seems tenuous. What is the connection between gradient L_{val} and pairwise reward?"

Although the ROSE method has achieved remarkable results in data selection, its implementation involves complex gradient calculations and impact estimations, which may lead to high computational costs and implementation complexity, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets and models.\n2. The ROSE method relies on a small number of preference validation sets to guide data selection, so the quality of the preference data is crucial to the final selection effect. If the preference data is inaccurate or biased, it may affect the fine-tuning effect of the model. Moreover, there are no relevant experiments in the paper to illustrate that the \"optimization direction\" of the designed preference validation set and the evaluated dataset for the model is consistent. This makes it impossible for the method in the paper to provide evidence when attempting to demonstrate that the traditional loss minimization is inconsistent with the actual task performance of the model.\n3. In addition, most of the methods for screening instruction data of large models in the model comparison are some relatively old baselines. There is a lack of comparison with some more recent methods, and very few recent related works are introduced either.\n- From quantity to quality: Boosting LLM performance with self-guided data selection for instruction tuning\n- One-shot learning as instruction data prospector for large language models\n- What makes good data for alignment?

I suspect this limitation is due to the nature of the pairwise preference loss, which may restrict ROSE's ability to extend to other tasks.\n\n2. Given that ROSE introduces pairwise preference loss calculations in the data selection process, I'm unsure whether this increases the method's computational complexity. This includes the asymptotic complexity, wall-clock runtime (measured in single A100 GPU hours), and associated storage costs for different stages such as Warmup LoRA Training, Gradient Features Computation, and Data Selection. If these costs significantly exceed full data training costs, it could potentially diminish the practicality of this method."
