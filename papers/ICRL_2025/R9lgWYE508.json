    "title": "Relaxing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting",
    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the limitations of the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) optimization scheme, revealing why it undergoes significant performance drops when initialized with noisy or random point clouds. Through in-depth analysis, we identify a key limitation of the 3DGS optimization: limited Gaussian transportability. Since Gaussians are optimized solely based on image photometric loss, the optimization tends to overfit the parameters of the projected Gaussians to improve reconstruction at their current positions, rather than relocating them to more optimal locations. This leads to producing under-reconstructed regions when starting with noisy or random initialization, failing to transport Gaussians to correct locations. Based on our findings, we propose RAIN-GS (Relaxing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting), a set of simple yet effective modifications, including initializing sparse Gaussians with large variances, progressive Gaussian low-pass filtering, and an Adaptive Bound-Expanding split algorithm. These modifications enable Gaussians to effectively redistribute across the scene, capturing both coarse structure and fine details. By addressing the inherent limitations of 3DGS, RAIN-GS allows effective training even with random point clouds, significantly enhancing reconstruction quality.",

                "value": "This submission investigates the initialization strategy commonly used in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) optimization schemes. The authors present some technical insights towards the question of why the 3DGS optimizers tend to perform poorly when the centers of the 3D Gaussians are initialized from random values. They coin a new term in the paper and call the phenomena \u201clow Gaussian transportability\u201d. The authors also argue that the sole use of photometric error leads to the aforementioned limitation.\n\nTo address the observed limitations in optimizing 3DGS representations from noisier initialization, the authors have proposed some remedies, such as a) starting with fewer Gaussians with significantly larger covariances, applying low pass filtering progressively, introducing heuristics for reducing the gaussian size as the optimization progresses and the number of Gaussians in the scene increase, new splitting criteria.\n\nEmpirically these ideas lead to incremental improvements on the popular datasets (Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate 10K, Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending) in terms of standard metrics (pSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc.). An ablation study was also reported to measure the benefit of each of the proposed modifications in isolation."

It leads to small but consistent improvements in the reconstruction quality on several datasets especially when the optimizer is started with noisy or random initialization of the 3D point coordinates. In general, the arguments and insights they present sounds reasonable in theory and seems to be helping in practice as shown in the empirical results."

                "value": "The authors try to improve 3DGS performance when the Gaussians are initialized from random 3D points. While their results show some promise towards that end, they however assume that the camera poses are accurate. Typically, a full SfM pipeline must be executed to obtain accurate camera poses \u2013 must run bundle adjustment till completion. When running a full BA, accurate points are typically obtained as a by-product and no extra computation is needed. So, in other words, I don\u2019t see a compelling situation where the 3DGS optimizer must be initialized from a random 3D point cloud when accurate camera poses are already available. In case of Re10K, the 3D points could be initialized using triangulated feature matches where both matching and triangulation could leverage the accurate poses.\n\nHowever, it becomes much more interesting and relevant when camera poses are obtained from a different source and not necessarily extremely accurate.\n\nWhile the paper is readable, the main paper lacks sufficient technical detail. The authors introduce the idea of limited Gaussian portability but in Section 4.2 there is an empirical study on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset without any deeper insights. Notably other authors have already investigated the issue of local minima in the optimization landscape. So I am not convinced that this paper extends the insight beyond what is already known in the literature. So I would argue against the first claimed contribution on page 2 \u201cFor the first time, we conduct an in-depth analysis and identify \u2026 \u201c.\n\nThe ideas of improving the initialization seem reasonable but none of these modifications guarantees escaping local minima. For example, the authors state in Section 5.1 \u201cTo prevent the Gaussians from falling into local minima, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the original random initialization\u201d. Even though some benefits of the proposed scheme are shown in the empirical evaluation, in the absence of any formal guarantees, the claims should be toned down a bit. Similarly, the specific split heuristic describes here (called ABE-Split) is a variation of existing splitting strategies and there is not much detail why this specific criteria should be used."

However, throughout the paper, the standard photometric loss continues to be used in the optimization objective without any modifications. Thus, it would help to put less emphasis on the particular point when motivating the problem."

To solve the issue, the paper proposes initializing 3D Gaussians with larger variances so that Gaussians can cover more regions of the image and learn more about the global structure of the scene. Moreover, the paper proposes progressive low-pass filtering techniques to encourage Gaussians to receive more gradients during training. The paper also uses an adaptive bound-expanding split algorithm to overcome the limitation that the variance of Gaussians becomes small after multiple splitting steps.

Some further discussions: With the recent advancements in monocular reconstruction algorithms, such as Dust3R and DepthPro, which allow for effective 3D reconstruction without relying on Colmap or even poses, would the proposed method conflict with or complement these approaches? Could case studies be conducted to explore this?\n\nI might raise my rating if my concerns are addressed."

The authors claim limited Gaussian transportation as a reason for the problem, and provide the analysis on movement of Gaussians as evidence.

In Table 5, the author claims that when combined with the low-pass filter and ABE-Split algorithm, SLV initialization shows the best performance.
