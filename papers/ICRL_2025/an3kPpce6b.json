    "title": "Steering 3D Molecule Generation in Data-Sparse Regions via Distributional Physical Priors",
    "abstract": "Can we train a 3D molecule generator using data from dense regions to generate samples in sparse regions? This challenge can be framed as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generation problem. Existing works on OOD generation primarily focus on property shifts. However, the distribution shifts may come from structural variations in molecules, such as certain types of scaffolds, dubbed as physical priors. This work introduces a novel and principled diffusion-based generative framework, termed _GODD_, which enables training a generator on data-abundant distributions to generalize to data-scarce distributions under structure shifts. Specifically, we propose utilizing a designated equivariant asymmetric autoencoder to capture distributional physical priors. The asymmetric module allows generalization to unseen, out-of-distribution structural variations. As these captured physical priors represent distinct distributions, they can steer the generation of samples that are not in dense regions. We demonstrate that with these encoded structural-grained distributional physical priors, _GODD_ does not need to train with any molecules from the sparse regions. We conduct extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution molecule generation tasks using benchmark datasets. Compared to alternative baselines, our approach shows a significant improvement of up to 65.6\\% in success rate, defined based on molecular validity, uniqueness, and novelty. Additionally, we show that our generative framework, steered by physical priors, can be readily adapted to canonical fragment-based drug design tasks, exhibiting promising performance.",

                "value": "To address the generation of OOD molecules with rare scaffolds, this work proposes a diffusion framework conditioned on physical priors from molecular fragments. The model comprises an equivariant autoencoder that encodes the 3D molecular fragment graph into equivariant and invariant latent representations as physical priors, and a diffusion model that generates molecules conditioned on the priors. The authors test the method on OOD ring and scaffold structures and show superior performance than existing methods."

Some additional analysis are needed to prove the claim (see Questions).  \n2. The actual application of the method is somewhat limited as a pre-defined scaffold structure needs to be provided to the model."

How is the input scaffold selected for the generation of molecules >10 rings?\n2. Since the scaffold information is provided as a condition, not explicitly enforced, it is possible that the scaffold is edited (e.g. slight changes in atom types and coordinates) during the generation due to the stochastic nature of DDPM. From Fig 11, it seems to be quite common. How is the proportion and coverage calculated with those cases?\n3. For linker design tasks, the initial structures are two molecular fragments. In this scenario, how is the scaffold defined and provided to the diffusion model?\n4. Following the previous question, if the model could work with disconnected scaffold in linker design, would it also work with incomplete scaffolds? (e.g. providing an increasing proportion of the fragment to the diffusion model).\n5. As mentioned in \"limitations\", a known scaffold structure needs to be provided. Is it possible to generalize it to randomly generated OOD scaffold structures?\n\nMinor:\n1. The authors name the prior as \u201cphysical\u201d, while it is actually learned only from the 3D structure of the fragments. What is \u201cphysical\u201d about it?\n2. For molecules with a large number of rings, the variations of ring structure is exponentially larger. How is the input scaffold selected for the generation of molecules >10 rings?\n3. As $f_h$ only has 1 dimension per atom, is the representation expressive enough? Would the model benefit from higher dimensionality?\n4. How is the atom number determined when sampling $z_{x,T}$, $z_{h,T}$?"

It is unclear whether authors are trying to obscure the simplicity in the method by invoking overly convoluted language.  For example use \"physical prior\" to denote a learned embedding used to guide/steer generation.\nb. Proofs on the equivariance are presented as new, yet are simple (trivial?) extensions of well known proofs in the field, and there are no references to the original work e.g. Kohler et al ICML 2020 and others. Can the authors perhaps clarify the connection to this previous work and highlight how what they present is different?\nc. While the proposed method beats a range of baselines, it is unclear whether results are good enough to be useful in a practical setting. The dataset which would be a useful benchmark for a method like this, the molecular stability should be at least 50%. On QM9 which is arguably not a helpful benchmark for this task, e.g. fragment based drug design, the method barely reaches this level."

It is reported for most standard molecular generation tasks, benchmarks you compare against have ~80-92% AS for unconditional sampling. Are you referring to the 'OOD' generation task? That seems to be the case since the atom stability is very low (Table 3), so low in fact that it is unlikely that any molecules that are generated are even valid. It seems like the comparison is nearly meaningless. For QM9 the results are better, but still far from being utile in a practical setting, since QM9 is unlikely to be used for fragment based drug discovery."

Specifically, how are $f_x$ and $f_h$ integrated into the noisy point clouds $z_x$ and $z_h$, and how does the EGNN ($\\epsilon_\\theta$) operate on this mixed point cloud? This is a critical aspect of the method but is not discussed in sufficient detail (correct me if I missed something). Additionally, Figure 1 is somewhat confusing: It depicts the physical prior as a global-level representation, whereas it is actually a latent point cloud, which is conceptually quite different (lots of previous and concurrent work has managed the first case).\n2. Potentially Unfair Comparisons: The experimental comparisons may be somewhat skewed. For example, in Tables 2 and 3, models like EDM, GeoLDM, and EquiFM condition on nothing, so it\u2019s not surprising that the percentage (P%) of OOD generation is small, which likely reflects the rarity of OOD structures in the overall distribution. This is even pronounced when these models weren\u2019t even trained on the entire dataset. While the authors attempt to construct comparable baselines such as C-EDM, conditioning on a single number seems less fair compared to the geometry elements (referred to as physical priors) that GODD conditions on. In fact, these geometry elements are the targets we aim to generate, so evaluating the partition of these elements in the output when they are taken as input may not be as fair."
