    "title": "R$^2$: A LLM Based Novel-to-Screenplay Generation Framework with Causal Plot Graphs",
    "abstract": "Automatically adapting novels into screenplays is important for the TV, film, or opera industries to promote products with low costs. The strong performances of large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a LLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task. However, there are two fundamental challenges here. First, the LLM hallucinations may cause inconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. Second, the causality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent rewriting. Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A hallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and eliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph construction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to efficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those efficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay rewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build the causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene outlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into both modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing approaches (51.3\\%, 22.6\\%, and 57.1\\% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.",

With the advent of generative AI, it is more promising for generative AI to directly generate screenplay instead of transforming from novels. \n\nW2. The paper lacks novelty. The two key technical contributions of this work are HAR and CPC. However, HAR simply adopts the self-refinement idea which has been widely studied. Moreover, CPC includes causal graph identification and cycle removal, where the cycle removal simply use the existing algorithms and the more crucial identification is not sufficiently discussed and introduced. \n\nW3. The method lacks necessary illustration of how LLMs are prompted, especially for the causal plot graph, which is a key concept throughout the whole paper."

Is HAR also applied to the causal relationship generation process?\n\n4.\tWhy are the results of the proposed methods different across comparisons between different methods (e.g., results of R^2 are all different across Table 1-3).
