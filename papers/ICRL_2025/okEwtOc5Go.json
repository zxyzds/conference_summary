    "title": "Mini-Gemini: Mining the Potential of Multi-modality Vision Language Models",
    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance across various cross-modal tasks %and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously. Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models. Code and models will be available to the public.",

Although there is still a gap between the proposed method and current SoTA private models, the Mini-Gemini has already outperformed many open-sourced models.\n3.

                "value": "### 1. Efficiency and Novelty\nFrom the experimental approach perspective, increasing the image resolution and dataset quality will elevate the performance of VLM[1]. \n\nIn order to enhance the visual representation, the paper introduces one more visual encoder. \n\nAlso, the authors collect a higher quality dataset to improve the performance. \n\nFrom an overall construction perspective, the authors leveraged additional resources to enhance the performance. However, from a research novelty standpoint, I feel this paper does not provide substantial new insights. Although the proposed approach is somewhat instructive, I believe this work primarily focuses on stacking resources to achieve better results rather than offering sufficient genuine innovation.\n\n### 2. Error Analysis\nAll qualitative results showcase the capability of Mini-Gemini, but I think the error analysis also plays an important role in seeing why the current model fails and which direction we can improve in the future.\n\n### 3. Some More Experiments\nAs far as I see, this work focuses on the zero-shot settings. However, nowadays, with the increase in training data, achieving a purely or strictly zero-shot scenario is quite difficult, as good zero-shot performance may often result from the downstream tasks containing elements similar to the training set. \n\nTherefore, rather than focusing on zero-shot scenarios, I am more interested in exploring few-shot capabilities. Few-shot not only allows us to observe the final performance but also reveals the model\u2019s instruction-following ability. If the authors could conduct more few-shot experiments, I think it would make the study even more interesting.\n\n[1] MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. I can understand the importance of increasing the image resolution for VLM, but a lot of work just crudely resizes the image without supporting arbitrary resolutions. Since the ConvNeXt is used as Visual Encoder, I am wondering why experiments are not conducted on the images with a larger aspect ratio. Because there is a greater loss of information when this type of image is fed into the VLM.\n2. For patch info mining in Figure 3, I have some doubts about this module, such as: Is the channel dimension compressed? Why are the shapes K and V in the calculation NxM2X1? Besides, the entire cross-attention is an attention with window size M, will pixels located at the edges of the window be affected in the calculation? \n3. Please add some comparisons such as VILA, LLaVA-Next, Qwen-VL, and MiniCPM-V. \n4. In Table 2, is Mini-Gemini the final version? Has the token extension overhead been calculated? What is its latency\uff1f\n5. In ablation study, is there an experimental comparison between Patch Info mining and Visual token extension? How effective is token extension alone? It seems like it improves the model very much.\n6. Table 1 would be clearer if it were compared by model size or added line graphs.\n7. Very happy to see a combination of VLMs and generative models. However, can Mini-Gemini enhance the ability to generate quality? With training on the dataset with Gen token, Mini-Gemini can generate images via SDXL, it's more of an agent to indicate when to use the SDXL model as well as adjust the prompt to increase the ability to Instruction-following for generating images. How does image understanding enhance image generation in multi-round? Another question is, is it possible to realize multiple rounds of modifications to the same image?"

This type of data collection may help open-sourced models to catch up but may never produce a better model, thus having limited insights for future research.\n\n2. **Human evaluation of the usability of models.** Although the benchmark numbers look good, they may not correctly reflect models' usability, as many benchmarks have biases, unuseful output formats (e.g., multiple choice), disconnected from real-world use cases, etc. When applied in the wild, the proposed model may still have a big gap with GPT-4V.
