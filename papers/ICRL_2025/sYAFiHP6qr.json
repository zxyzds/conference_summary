    "title": "Implicit Neural Surface Deformation with Explicit Velocity Fields",
    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce the first unsupervised method that simultaneously predicts time-varying neural implicit surfaces and deformations between pairs of point clouds. We propose to model the point movement using an explicit velocity field and directly deform a time-varying implicit field using the modified level-set equation. This equation utilizes an iso-surface evolution with Eikonal constraints in a compact formulation, ensuring the integrity of the signed distance field. By applying a smooth, volume-preserving constraint to the velocity field, our method successfully recovers physically plausible intermediate shapes. Our method is able to handle both rigid and non-rigid deformations without any intermediate shape supervision. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, delivering superior results in both quality and efficiency.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a method to simultaneously recover the implicit neural representation of two given point cloud inputs, together with time-varying intermediate shapes between them. The point movement is modeled using an explicit velocity field regularized with smoothness and divergence-free constraints, and the shape is implicitly deformed using the modified level-set equation. The method is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating its ability to model both pose and non-rigid deformation, as well as its robustness to incomplete and sparse input."

This modification ensures both the velocity field and implicit function are supervised to enforce the Eikonal constraint at each step. This approach is novel and effective in this context.\n- **Performance**: The method demonstrates a better capability to recover physically plausible intermediate shapes compared to the given baselines.\n- **Robustness to Incomplete and Sparse Input**: The proposed method is robust to the size of the target input point cloud. Unlike other methods, it can accurately recover the target shape and generate plausible intermediate shapes, even when the input is ten times sparser."

Why is it reasonable to assume that correspondances are available?\n- **Correspondances**: While an ablation of the sparsity of the correspondences is available in the supplementary materiel, it\u2019s not clear what happens when correspondances are not available i.e without the last term of Equ.15. On the other hand, can other methods rely on the correspondance information? For example, could this constraint be embedded in NISE and how does it perform in this case ?\nOn the other hand, one numerical result that can strenghten the paper is the average error of the method using correspondences from Cao et al. (2024a) . This should be added to table (a). In addition, it would be helpfull to also show the result with GT correspondences  in Fig.11 to better see the difference. \n- **Ablation of the modified level-set equation ablation**: Figure 8 is a bit surprising. Why is the OLSE baseline not able to recover the final shape while this constraint is explicitly enforced in the loss function ? Is the volume preserving term used in this experiment ?"

For example, during training 20,000 points are sampled from the surface, 5%-20% of them (1000-4000 points) are corresponded. This prior information makes the task itself much easier. From this perspective, I do not agree with the claim that the proposed learning framework is fully \u201cunsupervised\u201d.\n\n- The experimental results suggest that the input shapes have similar geometries or poses and the method cannot handle very large deformations."

What would happen if the input model becomes \"broken,\" for example, if one paw is separated from the dog's leg? Is your method robust enough to handle such scenarios?\n\nI suggest adding visulizations of the learned velocity fields.\n\nSince the method is SDF-driven, it cannot handle surfaces with large boundaries, such as the clothes models in the DeepFashion3D dataset. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to discuss this issue.\n\nCan your method handle inputs of different topologies? For example, a standing man with genus 0 and another person with hands on the waist, which is of genus 2.\n\nThe authors claim that the intermediate shapes are physically plausible; however, all evaluation metrics provided are geometric. Additionally, the velocity loss, which includes a smoothness term and a divergence-free term, is not directly related to physical principles. Therefore, this claim requires better justification using quantitative physical measures."
