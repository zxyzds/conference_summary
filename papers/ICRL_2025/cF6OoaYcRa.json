    "abstract": "Neural PDEs have emerged as inexpensive surrogate models for numerical PDE solvers. While they offer efficient approximations, they often lack robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), limiting their practical utility. Existing UQ methods for these models typically have high computational demands and lack guarantees. We introduce a novel framework for calibrated physics-informed uncertainty quantification to address these limitations. Our approach leverages physics residual errors as a nonconformity score within a conformal prediction (CP) framework. This enables data-free, model-agnostic, and statistically guaranteed uncertainty estimates. Our framework utilises convolutional layers as finite difference stencils for gradient estimation, our framework provides inexpensive coverage bounds for the violation of conservation laws within model predictions. In our experiments, we utilise CP to obtain marginal coverage for each cell and joint coverage over the entire prediction domain of various PDEs.",

                "value": "This paper presents a data-free conformal prediction approach for uncertainty quantification in neural PDE solvers, which does not require additional true PDE solutions to evaluate nonconformity scores. This data-free capability is achieved by assessing physics residual errors (PRE), or violations of conservation laws, for each prediction. PRE-CP provides both marginal (dimension-wise) and joint (domain-wide) coverage, enabling statistically sound conformal bounds for predictions. Additionally, the authors employ convolutional layers as finite difference stencils for faster and more accurate gradient estimation, as well as a rejection sampling method that uses CP-based criteria to reject predictions with a predetermined probability."

The authors should specify what guarantees these methods do not provide which conformal prediction does provide. \n2) The paper does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and should be more explicit and precise about what type of uncertainty quantification it provides. \n3) On line 155 there is a claim: \u201cWe introduce a novel data-free nonconformity score for Conformal Prediction (CP) to obtain statistically valid and guaranteed error bounds for neural PDE solvers.\u201d\nTheoretical support should be provided to this claim. \n4) Both Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate very large confidence intervals for joint CP which would not correspond to 95% coverage. For marginal CP, it is hard to visually tell what coverage is. The same holds for the later figures. The paper should provide additional metrics to evaluate the results quantitatively. \n5) Figure 4 and 5 provide a single illustrative example and not a proper Monte Carlo study to illustrate the calibration and coverage of the method.
