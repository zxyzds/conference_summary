    "title": "Looks Great, Functions Better: Physics Compliance Text-to-3D Shape Generation",
    "abstract": "Text-to-3D shape generation has shown great promise in generating novel 3D content based on given text prompts. However, existing generative methods mostly focus on geometric or visual plausibility while ignoring function for the generated 3D shapes. This greatly hinders the practicality of generated 3D shapes in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Fun3D, a physics driven functional text-to-3D shape generation method. By analyzing the solid mechanics of generated 3D shapes, we reveal that the 3D shapes generated by existing text-to-3D generation methods are impractical for real-world applications as the generated 3D shapes do not conform to the laws of physics. To this end, we leverage 3D diffusion models to provide 3D shape priors and design a data-driven differentiable physics layer to optimize 3D shape priors with solid mechanics. This allows us to optimize geometry efficiently and learn physics information about 3D shapes at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can consider both geometric plausibility and functional requirement, further bridging 3D virtual modeling and physical worlds.",

This layer is trained using physics priors embedded through Finite Element Method (FEM) data, which provides a high level of accuracy in simulating the mechanical properties of the 3D shapes.\n\nFun3D adopts an alternating training strategy that efficiently balances the optimization of geometry and physics, leading to shapes that are robust and better suited for applications such as engineering design and virtual prototyping."

                "value": "Primarily, the physical considerations in Fun3D are somewhat narrow, focusing mainly on stress, strain, etc, which is not a general framework and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world physical interactions. This could potentially lead to 3D models that, despite conforming to the considered physical laws, still lack a broader range of physical realism. \n\nAdditionally, the generated models' overall quality is reported to be average. The paper does not extensively discuss autoencoder-based 3D generation frameworks, which provide good geometric configurations and may already possess desirable physical properties. This omission raises questions about the comprehensiveness of the authors' exploration of the 3D generation landscape."

Could you elaborate on how you demonstrate that these shapes not only adhere to theoretical physical principles but also exhibit good physical characteristics in practical applications? Specifically, I would like to know if you have conducted any simulations or real-world tests, such as finite element analysis (FEA) simulations or actual 3D printing, to validate the structural integrity and functionality of the generated shapes in real-world scenarios."

Existing text-to-3D models primarily focus on visual and geometric accuracy but lack physical realism, which limits practical applications. Fun3D addresses this gap by integrating physics, specifically solid mechanics, into the generative process. It uses a two-stage framework: an initial 3D shape is generated via 3D diffusion models and then optimized through a differentiable physics layer. This layer utilizes a mix of geometry and physics constraints, leveraging finite element method (FEM) data to improve stability and load-bearing capacity. Experiments demonstrate that Fun3D yields more physically robust shapes compared to baseline models like Diffusion-SDF, making it suitable for engineering and other real-world applications."

Evaluation Metric Bias: Physical strength is evaluated using FEM, which is also an integral component of Fun3D\u2019s training. This could bias results in favor of the proposed model.

I am curious about the applicability of Fun3D to other types of objects where some of the parts are soft and some of the parts are solid. For example, in animals in Figure 6, the strength of the animal and the stress on them do not necessarily depend on the geometry we see on the outside. They are often more related to the structure of their bones and muscles. So why is Figure 6 shown or discussed in this paper, and why the proposed method can help animal generation to have better physical properties?\n3. If some artist or architect wants to build something that is against the analysis of FEM, how do you balance the strength of the generated object and the design proposed by them?"

Therefore, it can be applied to any 3D model. As a result, the comparisons are just a demonstration that the post-process improves upon the initial model, but not a comparison against other work. The Design Loss, the Geometry Constraint Loss, and the Volume Regularization Loss do not directly, but only indirectly consider the generative model. While the paper tries to set itself apart from other competing work by claiming that \u201cAll these methods do not need to learn physics feedback during shape learning. Unlike them, our method collaboratively learns geometry and physics during training.\u201d. I cannot see how this is true. Please confirm if you want to claim that you train a generative model that uses physics during training of the generative model. Physics and generation in your approach does not seem to be integrated in an interesting manner. This is still fine for a good paper, but the results would need to be a lot stronger. Overall, the quality of the results is not impressive and they do not seem to be useful in the current stage."

How did you ensure that an unbiased and fair set of shapes are used in the comparison? Cherry-picking would greatly influence the quantitative comparison, so it would be good to know how cherry-picking was avoided. This is a major issue.\n\nI am not sure about the conversion of SDF to a density field. This will create a transition of densities from the outside to the inside, but it is not clear how fast this transition is compared to the scale of the object. Can you please describe the parameters of this conversion or let me know where I can find them in the paper. This is a minor issue."
