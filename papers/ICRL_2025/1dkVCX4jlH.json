    "title": "Uncertainty-Aware PPG-2-ECG for Enhanced Cardiovascular Diagnosis using Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Analyzing the cardiovascular system condition via Electrocardiography (ECG) is a common and highly effective approach, and it has been practiced and perfected over many decades. ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to acquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may span over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is Photoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood volume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''. While PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and cost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a more precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from PPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an unavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced classification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while taking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We provide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach, and present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

                "value": "This paper presents \"Uncertainty-Aware PPG-2-ECG (UA-P2E),\" a novel framework that employs diffusion models to convert photoplethysmography (PPG) signals into electrocardiography (ECG) signals for improved cardiovascular disease classification. Recognizing the ill-posed and inherently ambiguous nature of the PPG-to-ECG conversion\u2014stemming from the loss of certain physiological information in PPG measurements\u2014the authors propose a multi-solution approach to address this challenge. By leveraging diffusion models, UA-P2E captures the full distribution of possible ECG signals corresponding to a given PPG input, effectively modeling the uncertainty inherent in this inverse problem. This allows the framework to generate robust ECG signals that account for the variability and ambiguity of the conversion process. The authors validate their approach through experiments across multiple cardiovascular conditions, demonstrating state-of-the-art classification performance. They provide empirical evaluations, including comparisons with two baseline models, to substantiate the effectiveness of UA-P2E in both signal reconstruction and cardiovascular classification tasks."

                "value": "Originality and Significance: This paper offers a novel approach to the challenging PPG-to-ECG conversion by applying a diffusion-based, uncertainty-aware model. This method effectively addresses the inherently ill-posed nature of the task, capturing the distribution of possible ECG outputs rather than a single solution. By doing so, it meets a main need in cardiovascular diagnostics, especially where paired data is limited.\n\nMethodological Rigor: The paper demonstrates strong methodological rigor with a solid theoretical foundation, including proofs of the Expected Score Classifier's (ESC) optimality. This rigorous analysis, supported by detailed equations (e.g., Theorem 3.1), supports the model\u2019s reliability, ensuring both empirical soundness and theoretical robustness.\n\nComprehensive Evaluation: A thorough evaluation across 11 cardiovascular conditions highlights the model's generalizability and robustness. Compared to baseline models, it shows superior performance in signal reconstruction and classification, with added metrics for uncertainty quantification. This detailed analysis strengthens the case for clinical applicability.\n\nClarity and Presentation: The paper is well-organized, balancing technical details with intuitive explanations, such as figures illustrating model performance and ECG visualization strategies, enhancing clarity. The emphasis on interpretability supports practical use in clinical settings.\n\nSignificance for the Field: The integration of uncertainty-aware diffusion models for physiological signal conversion represents a meaningful enhancement in machine learning for healthcare. The interdisciplinary approach bridges machine learning and biomedical engineering with the potential to drive future innovations in cardiovascular diagnostics and medical device development."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Dependence on Synthetic Data: The evaluation heavily relies on synthetic PPG data, especially for augmenting the CinC dataset (Section 5.2\u200b). This dependence raises concerns about potential biases, as synthetic data may not fully capture the variability and complexities of real-world PPG signals. Consequently, the model's generalizability to real clinical settings might be limited, potentially affecting its practical applicability.\n\nLimited Baseline Comparisons: The paper compares UA-P2E primarily with two baseline models: CardioGAN and RDDM (Table 1). While these comparisons provide some insight, the limited scope restricts a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance relative to the broader range of existing methodologies. Including additional, especially more recent baseline models, such as those in the referenced ArXiv papers, would strengthen the evaluation and better position UA-P2E within the current state-of-the-art.\n\nPotential for Synthetic Artifacts: The possibility of generating hallucinations or artifacts in the synthetic ECG signals produced by the diffusion models is not thoroughly examined. Since diffusion-based models can introduce unrealistic features, a lack of analysis on this front may raise concerns about the reliability and clinical validity of the generated signals. Addressing this risk through quantitative assessments would enhance the credibility of the proposed approach.\n\nLimited Dataset Diversity: The study focuses on paired PPG-ECG datasets from CinC and MIMIC-III. This narrow dataset selection may not adequately demonstrate the model's flexibility or adaptability to other data sources. Expanding the evaluation to include larger or unpaired datasets would provide a more robust validation of the model's generalizability and its potential utility across diverse cardiovascular data."

The methodology is novel arguing that by using a multi-solution approach - where multiple ECG signals can generate the same PPG wave - the combined classification of the generated ECGs is more accurate in comparison to using only the PPG or using a single generated ECG from state-of-the-art methods. The authors use two datasets, one with pairs of unlabeled ECG and PPG signals and another with only labeled ECG signals. A reverse ECG-2-PPG model is used to generate synthetic PPG for classification."

The authors use 3 random seeds to generate the ECG signals from the PPG ones and report the mean and standard deviation for the chosen metrics. Given the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, are 3 seeds enough to capture the full range of ECG variability, or to provide significant statistical measures?\n2. Although the motivation for the use of PPG-2-ECG relies on the widespread of wearable devices, no database with signals acquired in wearable settings was used. For the diffusion model, the MIMIC-III data comes from hospital facilities (to my knowledge), and for classification, this is unclear (unless the CinC2017 database for AFib was used, for example). This should be stated as a limitation of the work, or as a pointer for future work."

Given the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, are 3 seeds enough to capture the full range of ECG variability, or to provide significant statistical measures in your work?\n2. Although the paper reports the classification of the mean and random ECG diffusion-based solutions, you do not mention the performance of CardioGAN and RDDM directly, which were initially used to benchmark the ECG generation performance. If the end goal is to improve classification with ECG-generated signals, don't you think that it would be appropriate to use the exact implementations of CardioGAN and RDDM to compare the performance?\n3. Did you ensure that there are no segments from the same recording in both the training and test datasets? I believe this is not mentioned. If the same recording appears in both datasets, the generalization ability of the approach might be not properly evaluated.\n\nAlso some missing information:\n- The exact database(s) of CinC that was(were) used, as there are many databases from this source available on PhysioNet\n- A data summary with the number of samples used to train and test the PPG conversion and classification models (and the corresponding class distributions)\n- Only the AURC is used to assess the classification performance, but since the pathological labels often suffer from class imbalance, more insightful metrics such as sensitivity, specificity and F1-Score could be reported to improve the clinical relevance of the approach and facilitate comparison with other works."
