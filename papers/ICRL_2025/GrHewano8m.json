    "title": "XXLTraffic: Expanding and Extremely Long Traffic forecasting beyond test adaptation",
    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is crucial for smart cities and intelligent transportation initiatives, where deep learning has made significant progress in modeling complex spatio-temporal patterns in recent years. However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, the longest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.",

I think it is necessary for the authors to explain in more depth the motivation for constructing such a long-term dataset, because as transportation infrastructure advances and human travel modes change, traffic data that is too ancient is not always helpful enough to understand future transportation patterns.\n\n3.  Due to the sheer size of the proposed dataset, it requires more computational resources. Therefore, whether this dataset can be popularized and whether peers can easily adopt it in their own research is also a concern."

Although this conference has a dataset and benchmarks area, I do not think, for a top-tier conference, it is enough to propose a large-scale dataset without any model contribution. Given the fact that there are existing large-scale datasets available with just the number of nodes or time spans fewer than XXTraffic, my concern becomes more intense.\n\n2.\tSome motivations remain unclear. In the introduction section, the authors mentioned \u2018beyond test adaptation\u2019. However, it is not easy to understand how this relates to the proposed datasets. Is the concept of \u2018beyond test adaptation\u2019 better or more realistic than test time adaptation?\n\n3.\tThe setting of Extremely Long Prediction with Gaps is a bit strange to me. Here, the authors used an example of highway route planning prediction to justify the necessity of the gap. It is possible that we need to stimulate the traffic flows of uninstalled sensors to facilitate road planning. Thus, the optimal setting should be using existing sensors to predict traffic flows of uninstalled sensors, plus the gap. However, it seems the authors still used historical signals of uninstalled sensors in this setting. If we already know their historical readings, we do not have to plan anything."
