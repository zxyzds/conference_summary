    "title": "ChemThinker: Thinking Like a Chemist with Multi-Agent LLMs for Deep Molecular Insights",
    "abstract": "Molecular property prediction is vital in drug discovery and cheminformatics, yet many current models lack interpretability, making it difficult for experts to understand the rationale behind predictions. To address this, we introduce ChemThinker, a novel large language models (LLMs) multi-agent framework designed to effectively control the internal representations of concepts and functions within LLMs. ChemThinker emulates the way chemists approach molecular analysis by integrating insights from three perspectives: general molecular properties, data-driven analysis, and task-specific factors. Each perspective uses an agentic approach to stimulate the LLM's internal representations, enabling more targeted and interpretable outputs based on the problem at hand, akin to how stimuli trigger the brain's cognitive processes. By feeding representations from these three perspectives into a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), ChemThinker achieves superior performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework provides interpretable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the predictions, making it a practical tool for drug discovery and other cheminformatics applications.",

The use of LLM embeddings in conjunction with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for molecular property prediction is not a novel concept.\n\nThe multi-agent framework is central to ChemThinker\u2019s design, but the rationale behind choosing three specific perspectives\u2014general molecular properties, data-driven analysis, and task-specific factors\u2014could be clarified. Why were these perspectives selected, and are they mutually exclusive or interdependent in practice? The authors could include a discussion or ablation study examining the impact of each perspective on predictive performance and interpretability to validate their choices.\n\nThe experimental results presented in the paper do not demonstrate that ChemThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in molecular property prediction across both classification and regression benchmarks. For a comprehensive comparison, the authors should consider the results reported in the following studies:\n\nRoss, Jerret, et al. \"Large-scale chemical language representations capture molecular structure and properties.\" Nature Machine Intelligence 4.12 (2022): 1256-1264.\nSoares, Eduardo, et al. \"A Large Encoder-Decoder Family of Foundation Models For Chemical Language.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.20267 (2024).\nThese references provide significant insights into current methodologies and benchmark performances in the field. Additionally, incorporating the QM9 dataset into their experimental framework would enhance the robustness of their evaluation and allow for a more direct comparison with existing models that utilize this widely recognized benchmark in molecular property prediction."

                "value": "The paper is poorly written. It is full of typos that should be caught by any spellchecker.\n\nThe paper claims to mirror the way of chemist's thinking. It fails to define the persona of a \"chemist\", though. This is important because chemistry is an exceptionally broad field that absolutely does not reduce to analysis of molecular structure.\n\nWhat is \"general molecular thinking\" in Section 3.1? Traditional computational tools are absolutely going beyond calculating simple chemoinformatic descriptors - there's a huge field of quantum chemistry and molecular simulations that can handle really complicated chemical scenarios. The entire semantic structure of the section is so nebulous, it raises a question as of the authorship of the text. There's no single technical, reproducible, systematically improvable description of the respective agent.\n\nThe questions provided as examples barely makes sense for a trained SME. For example, \"How does the molecule\u2019s 3D shape change, and what are the effects of these changes?\" cannot have a meaningful answer - molecules exist as Boltzman distributions of 3D configurations and the shifts of these distributions depend on the external conditions that have to be specified.\n\nThe same ambiguity and lack of technical substance characterizes sections 3.2 \"intuition-driven thinking\" and 3.3 \"task-specific thinking\". \n\nSection 3.4 \"thought-representation fusion\" describes a  fusion procedure that exists completely out of context of the previous sections. Representations of molecular structure descriptors, such as SMILES, and representation of arbitrary reasoning utterances about SMILES are different entities and the authors clearly do not understand this.\n\nThe performance benchmarks suggest that the paper aims to solve simple supervised learning tasks in QSAR/QSPR domain. The performance sees some improvement compared to alternatives, but it should be noted that this moderate improvement is achieved by increasing computing footprint by the factor that equals the number of agents. This looks a lot like a case of diminishing returns.\n\nSome of the data in the tables are incorrectly labeled to favor the reported model. For example, in Table 2, ESOL(1), performance of LLM4SD should be ranked better than ChemThinker (Gallactica).  There are several instances where comparison of the models in terms of average performance might look different from the comparison of the performance distributions (Table 1: BBBP ChemThinker OpenAI vs LLM4SD; SIDER ChemThinker OpenAI vs UniMol, etc)\n\nOne of the not-so-obvious aspects of this work is that while it is reporting regression and classification of molecules expressed in some electronic format, such as SMILES, it does employ LLMs that have full capability to help bad actors and bring harmful items into the physical world, by proposing synthetic routes. Unfortunately, the authors don't seem to realize that the simple feature-engineering task accomplished by LLM agents places their work in a much broader context that requires ethical guardrails."

                "value": "# A) Lack of clarity and false and tenuous claims.\n\nThe work completely fails to embed itself into relevant related work. It provides a highly flawed and biased view on the field and misleads readers in many ways. The first paragraph cites completely inappropriate papers, such as (Yang, 2019) for \"molecular property prediction\". Molecular property prediction is a decade-old field an here, for example, papers by Corwin Hansch [1] should be cited. Neural network entered the field in the 1990s [2], and deep learning methods were used from 2014 on [3-6]. Toxicity prediction with deep learning methods started around 2015/2016 [6-7]. The authors should completely re-write the first paragraph and embed their work properly, and carefully assign credit to pioneering works in the field of molecular property prediction. \n\nAls the second paragraph mentions \"current approaches (Xia et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2024; Rollins et al., 2024)\", which is unclear: does this mean \"currently best performing methods\" (in this case, the claim is false), or \"current LLM-based approaches\". Furthermore, current best-performing approaches for molecular property prediction are hybrid methods that combine deep neural networks on descriptors with GNN-based representations (like Yang, 2019) and those are not \"statistical pattern\" based. The authors should completely re-work the second paragraph to make its theme clear and cite appropriate works. \n\nThe authors claim that LLMs perform \"reasoning\" which is highly debated [8] and questionable. If the authors insist on the point that LLMs indeed perform reasoning, they should provided substantial evidence for that and also cite works critizing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\nThe authors claim that \" [.fingerprint-based methods.] they normally rely on pre-defined fingerprint and may not fully capture the complex patterns [...]\", while it is rather the other way around: ECFP-based methods are as expressive as 1-WL, while many GNNs are not. SMILES-based approaches often lose stereo-chemical patterns. The authors should rectify this false claim.\n\n\n# B) Significance: The significance is very low due to inappropriate experiments and missing compared methods.\n\nThe authors perform molecular property only on eight tasks, while usually methods perform this on 1000s of tasks (e.g. [9,10]). Additionally, the MoleculeNet benchmarks are outdated and should not be used anymore [11]. There is also for sure an error in evaluation the ClinTox task because it is impossible to predict clinical toxicity of a molecule at 99.4 ROC AUC. Clinical toxicity is a very complicated end-point that depends on a lot of factors of the individual person, other medication, genetic composition, etc, such that even experimental replicates would never reach this quality. Reporting such high values at predicting clinical toxicity also leads to ethical concerns (see below). \n\nThe compared methods should also include several descriptor-based approaches. Since ChemThinker is an LLM-based approach, also other LLM-based method, such as KV-PLM [12] and CLAMP [13] should be compared. \n\nSince the authors claim in the abstract that their method is interpretable, they should rather not compare predictive performance, but focus on interpretability metrics, e.g., whether the toxicity-inducing parts of the molecules could be identified. \n\n# C) Originality: \n\nUsing LLMs and combining representations from different pre-trained models is already known. However, what could indeed provide some additional value is prompting LLMs to think about the general molecular structure. \n\n\n# D) Technical errors: \nThe overall approach is ad-hoc. It is unclear why exactly these components should be put together in the suggested way. The authors should propertly motivate and justify their approach and design decisions. They should perform an ablation study to identify which components yield advances in predictive performance or interpretability. \n\nIt is unclear whether LLMs can properly handle the SMILES strings as input. Usually the tokenizer is inappropraite for molecules. A single molecule can have many different SMILES representations, which could lead to different internal representations of the LLMs. Furthermore, stereochemistry is often lost in the SMILES strings. The authors should perform SMILES augmentation to show that their method is invariant to permuting SMILES strings. The authors should also include several stereo-isomers to show that ChemThinker can meaningfully distinguis stereo-isomers.\n\nThe overall training objective is not mentioned. It is unclear whether only the MLP is trained or whether the whole architecture is fine-tuned. The authors should present their approach clearer, write down the objective function, considered and selected hyperparamters, training and implementation details. \n\nTypos:\n- Chapter 2 \"Reltaed work\"\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hansch, C., Maloney, P.

It prompts the question of why only 3? Why those three in that exact phrasing? \n* The process was less transparent for the intuition driven thinking in 3.2 - I can tell the LLMs are given a persona to derive \u201crules\u201d but no examples of this are shown. Given that these rules are used to control which RDKit features are generated this makes it hard to understand exactly what is being done here. \n* I had a similar problem with the task specific thinking in 3.3 - It is not clear where the tailored insights to T are coming from / how that is being prompted of the LLM. An example is said to be in the appendix, but the appendix was missing from the PDF submitted to open Review. \n* It is unclear the typical size of the total concatenated embedding vector that is extracted per molecule, the number of calls to each LLM to generate this, the prompt structure used for each \u201cagent\u201d and the size of the final MLP.

Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 would be really useful, but in their current state are lacking enough information to adequately replicate any sort of results. \n\nFurther specific questions:\n\n* Why were the results only shown for the top 2 backbones in the tables, I would have expected to see all results there to better understand the properties of each model \n* Figure 3 was excellent - but I would like to see cleaner presentation, certainly flat bars if you think it should be a plot, but crucially the  lack of numerical values to extract made analysis of these results impossible. Maybe consider a table as I think this result is great!\n* In the conclusion and introduction you make claims about providing insights into the predictions, it would be good to see more evidence of these insights. Perhaps these are included in the appendix and were missing in the submission. \n* I also have questions about data leakage - many of the molecules in the dataset have well know properties and how much the LLMs are reporting the answers may not be reflective of performance on the benchmark. On one hand this doesn\u2019t matter as the method is demonstrating how to extract this information from the models, but on the other the comparison against other SOTA models could be misleading in these cases.
