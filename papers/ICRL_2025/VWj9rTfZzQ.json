    "title": "MEENT: DIFFERENTIABLE ELECTROMAGNETIC SIMULATOR FOR MACHINE LEARNING",
    "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EM) simulation plays a crucial role in analyzing and designing devices with sub-wavelength scale structures such as semiconductor devices and future displays. \nSpecifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device structures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research topics with far-reaching real world impact. \nTraditional algorithms for such tasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often yield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the algorithms and EM simulations. \nMachine learning (ML) emerged as a promising candidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has increasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical methods across various tasks.\nTo foster a synergistic collaboration between the optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation software that is user-friendly for both research communities.\nTo this end, we present meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities, meent serves as a versatile platform for integrating ML into optics research and vice versa.\nTo demonstrate its utility as a research platform, we present three applications of meent: 1) generating a dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the reinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a solution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers.\nThese applications highlight meent's potential to advance both EM simulation and ML methodologies. \nThe code is available on our Github repository with the MIT license to promote the cross-polinations of ideas among academic researchers and industry practitioners.",

In particular, how fast does meent generate EM simulation comparing to existing Cpp-based methods? \n- In other words, does the whole ML+EM pipeline take longer time by incorporating differentiable EM simulation? If the extra time is considerable, then the benefits of meent should be evaluated more carefully. \n- Since meent has some simulation error as discussed in Section 3, what is the performance degrade comparing to ML + classical EM simulators (e.g., Reticolo)? I think **it is helpful conduct the same set of experiments with ML+ Reticolo** and compare the resultant performance with the ones under meent."

                "value": "A key contribution of this work is the development of Meent. However, it is important to note that Meent is purely software based on numerical algorithms, and its development does not involve any ML techniques. The only connection to ML is the authors' use of Meent as a simulation backbone for dataset generation or device optimization.\n\nThis raises a significant concern: **there is no substantial contribution to the field of ML in this work**. If I may respectfully provide some examples that would align with ICLR's focus on ML, especially in the context of ML for photonics or AI for science: (1) The authors could propose a new neural operator (or architecture) that outperforms existing approaches such as FNO in predicting electromagnetic fields, such as [1,2]. (2) The paper could introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that demonstrates better performance than current RL methods or use RL addressing a problem no one has done before, such as AlphaFold, AlphaGo. (3) The authors could apply ML techniques to design a more compact photonic device with much better performance that no one can. \n\nUnluckily, this work doesn't fall into any of the categories above. While I recognize the potential value of this work, the primary contribution is not centered on ML. Therefore, I must recommend rejection for ICLR and suggest the authors consider alternative venues that might be more suitable, such as IEEE JLT, APL Photonics, Optica, Optica Express, Nature Photonics, or Nanophotonics.\n\n[1] Jiaqi Gu et al., 'Neurolight: A physics-agnostic neural operator enabling parametric photonic device simulation,' Neurips 2022.\n\n[2] Pingchuan Ma et al., 'PIC2O-Sim: A Physics-Inspired Causality-Aware Dynamic Convolutional Neural Operator for Ultra-Fast Photonic Device FDTD Simulation,' Arxiv."
