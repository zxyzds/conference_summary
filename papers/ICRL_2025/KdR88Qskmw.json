    "title": "The Contraction Property of Pooling Layer",
    "abstract": "Although the theory of deep neural networks has been studied for years, the mechanism of pooling layers is still elusive. In this paper, we report the angle contraction behavior of pooling strategies (the average pooling and max pooling) at initialization. Compared to the relu-activated fully connected layer or convolutional layer, the pooling layer stands as the main source of contraction of the angle between hidden features. Moreover, we show that the cosine similarity between average pooling features in convolutional neural network is more data-dependent than fully connected network, while the max pooling is not sensitive to the data distribution in both architectures. Our results may complement the understanding of the representation learning.",

                "value": "This paper studies angle contraction in pooling layers. It shows that angle contraction is not data-dependent in Fully Connected Networks (FCN) for average pooling and FCNs and CNNs for max pooling. It is, however, data-dependent in CNNs for average pooling. The paper performs both theoretical and empirical analysis on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and MNIST datasets."
