    "title": "A Framework for Finding Local Saddle Points in Two-Player Zero-Sum Black-Box Games",
    "abstract": "Saddle point optimization is a critical problem employed in numerous real-world applications, including portfolio optimization, generative adversarial networks, and robotics. It has been extensively studied in cases where the objective function is known and differentiable. Existing work in black-box settings with unknown objectives that can only be sampled either assumes convexity-concavity in the objective to simplify the problem or operates with noisy gradient estimators. In contrast, we introduce a framework inspired by Bayesian optimization which utilizes Gaussian processes to model the unknown (potentially nonconvex-nonconcave) objective and requires only zeroth-order samples. Our approach frames the saddle point optimization problem as a two-level process which can flexibly integrate existing and novel approaches to this problem. The upper level of our framework produces a model of the objective function by sampling in promising locations, and the lower level of our framework uses the existing model to frame and solve a general-sum game to identify locations to sample. This lower level procedure can be designed in complementary ways, and we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by introducing variants which appropriately trade off between factors like runtime, the cost of function evaluations, and the number of available initial samples. We experimentally demonstrate these algorithms on synthetic and realistic datasets, showcasing their ability to efficiently locate local saddle points in these contexts.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a new framework for finding local saddle points in zeroth-order black-box saddle point optimization. \nThe authors propose a bilevel framework inspired by Bayesian Optimization (BO) that leverages Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the unknown objective function. The lower-level game uses confidence bounds from the GP to define a general-sum game, the solution of which (a local Nash point) is used to guide sampling of the objective function. The high-level game updates the GP model with the new samples and iteratively searches for a local saddle point. The empirical results show that BSP variants outperform baseline approaches like naive random sampling and zeroth-order gradient descent-ascent on these problems."

Do you plan to address this limitation in future work?\n- The experiments are ultimately not convincing: while the experiments on synthetic data successfully achieve the optimal merit function, the real-world examples are less successful compared to the only other baseline and require further improvement.\n- Lack of sufficient theoretical guarantees for the method: While Lemma 4.1 demonstrates the convergence of LLGAME to a Local Nash Point (LNP), the paper lacks a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of the overall Bayesian Saddle Point (BSP) algorithm to a Local Saddle Point (LSP). This is particularly important, as the authors acknowledge that the LNP returned by LLGAME might not necessarily be an LSP of the original objective function."

Most existing works on two-player zero-sum games come with end-to-end analysis on convergence rate/sample complexity. Rigorous theoretical results allow us to judge algorithms in terms of efficiency, restrictiveness of assumptions, etc. Without such theoretical results, it is hard to compare the proposed algorithm with those in the existing literature and those to be introduced in the future.\n\nRegarding the takeaways highlighted in line 478-510 -- this is a plausible explanation that matches the observation from a few small-scale experiments. Much more extensive experiments need to be conducted to verify the statement. In the absence of theoretical convergence guarantees, systematic numerical simulations are especially important for understanding the algorithm performance, but they are currently missing."

The abstract and introduction should be revised for better clarity.\n\n2) In Algorithm 1 line 4 and Algorithm 2 line 7, you are not returning $\\bar{x}^*,\\bar{y}^*$/$x^*,y^*$. You are returning the iterates as an estimate of $\\bar{x}^*,\\bar{y}^*$/$x^*,y^*$."
