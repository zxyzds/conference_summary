    "abstract": "We extend the Differential Privacy (DP) framework to Hadamard manifolds, the class of complete and simply connected Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature. Inspired by the Cartan\u2013Hadamard theorem, we introduce Exponential-Wrapped Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms to achieve $\\varepsilon$-DP, $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP, Gaussian DP (GDP), and R\\'enyi DP (RDP) on these manifolds. Our approach employs efficient, straightforward algorithms that circumvent the computationally intensity Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods.  This work is the first to extend $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP, GDP, and RDP to Hadamard manifolds. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through simulations on the space of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices, a frequently used Hadamard manifold in statistics. Our findings reveal that our Exponential-Wrapped mechanisms surpass traditional MCMC-based approaches, which require careful tuning and extensive diagnostics, in both performance and ease of use. Additionally, our methods achieve comparable utility to the Riemannian Laplace mechanism with enhanced utility for smaller privacy budgets ($\\varepsilon$) and operate orders of magnitude faster computationally.",

                "value": "This paper extends the Differential Privacy framework to the class of complete and simply connected Riemannian manifolds - Hadamard manifolds. The major contributions are the first extension of Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms that could achieve DP, GDP and RDP on these manifolds. The new method is named Exponential-Wrapped mechanism in the sense that they are deducted through the Exponential Mapping  and their push forward functions. The approach gives efficient, straightforward algorithms comparable to the vanilla mechanisms in Euclidean space. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through simulations on the space of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices, a frequently used Hadamard manifold in statistics. In numerical experiments, the Exponential-Wrapped mechanisms beat traditional MCMC-based approaches in efficiency and achieve comparable utility to the Riemannian Laplace mechanism with enhanced utility."

It could be that my geometry is simply rusty, but I'm not sure how familiar the general community for this venue are with the math concepts used in this paper. In light of that, I think this paper sort of takes it for granted that people know all these things (such as Exponential mapping, push-forward, etc.) already. I find the preliminary section to be unsatisfying and insufficient of the crucial math concepts used later in the deduction of the mechanisms in general. My (biased) opinion is that some of these things deserve more explanation before we go deeper into the weeds. \n\nI was also slightly surprised that when $\\varepsilon$ is about [0.2, 0.6], the benchmark algorithm performs better than the proposed algorithm. I think in Euclidean spaces at least for pure DP the Laplace mechanism should be pretty close to being optimal for such small $\\varepsilon$ values? \n\nThere isn't much theoretical characterization of how good such generalization mechanisms are, even in the pure DP case. But perhaps that's because the community simply don't know much in this more complicated context."

I thought the Hardamard Manifold is basically a warped version of Euclidean space, but then in principle why do we need to use an additional $p_0$ to define the Laplace Mechanism? To help the understanding, can the authors recast the results back into Euclidean space and show the value of all these parameters given $\\epsilon$ for pure DP budget?\n\nMinor:\n\nIn line 108 the sentence seems incomplete: \"There exists a unique [???] starting from...\"\n\nThe notion $p_0$ abruptly appeared in line 188."

                "value": "The paper proposes a method to extend Differentially Private mechanisms designed for Euclidean space to general Riemannian manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature, aka. Hadamard manifolds. The general idea is to use the Cartan-Hadamard theorem which says that for Hadamard manifolds, a universal cover (a map between two topological spaces) is diffeomorphic (i.e., bijective or invertible) to Euclidean space via the exponential map at any point. This exponential map on a Riemannian manifold is a way to \"unroll\" a point's local geometry, letting us move along geodesics (the \"straightest\" paths) from that point in the manifold, like traveling in a direction on a curved surface as if it were flat. Thanks to the invertibility of this exponential map, the paper proposes a straightforward way to perturb points in the Hadamard manifold to satisfy differential privacy, which they call *Exponential-wrapping* --- 1) first, map the point in the manifold to the Euclidean space using the inverse of the exponential map, 2) apply a well-known mechanism like Gaussian or Laplace, then 3) invert the noisy point back to the Hadamard manifold using the exponential map. The authors argue that this style of noise sampling is computationally efficient compared to other methods in literature that rely on MCMC methods. Additionally, the paper also provides a utility analysis for DP Frechet mean computed using their proposed exponentially-wrapped Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms. A simulation comparing prior MCMC methods with proposed mechanisms for DP Frechet mean is also presented."

                "value": "- The main drawback of this approach is the cost that seems to be associated with the choice of the footpoint around which the mechanism is wrapped. More specifically, in equation (2) and (3), the utility for Frechet mean via the proposed mechanisms is closely tied to the choice of footpoint $p_0$ chosen on the manifold. Even when $p_0$ is set to be the center $m$ of the ball $B_r(m)$ in which all data-points lie, the utility upper bound is as high as $r$, which is of the same order as a random guess within the ball. This seems to be true for both the proposed EW Gaussian and EW Laplace mechanisms.\n- Authors mention that the footpoint $p_0$ for their proposed mechanisms must be selected *a priori* without looking at the data. But, it isn't obvious to me why this footpoint can't be data-dependent. I suspect the utility of the mechanisms can significantly improve if some of the privacy budget is spent to privately determine a good footpoint for the mechanism first.\n- Unlike Gaussian mechanism whose utility guarantee remains dimension independent, it's exponentially-wrapped counterpart proposed seem to be somehow dependent in the dimension size (eqn. (3)). I'm not certain if this dependence helps or hurts when dimension $d$ is large.\n- The simulation results suggest that Riemannian Laplace mechanism proposed in the prior works performs better than this paper's EW Laplace in higher dimensions or in reasonable privacy regimes (1 > eps > 0.5). In lines 415-417, the authors acknowledge that this is expected as the utility advantage of their mechanism are reserved for non-homogeneous manifolds. Most manifolds we see in practice however are homogeneous---spheres, Torus, Grassmannian, etc."

Could the authors give an example to help me see why the design of their mechanism fixes $p_0$ a-priori was necessary as opposed to setting $p_0$ to be the same as the unperturbed outcome?\n- Could the authors describe the technical reason behind the dependence on dimension size for the EW-Gaussian mechanism in equation (3)? In lines 417-419, authors mention something about the volume distortions being more pronounced in higher dimensions, but I don't quite understand the magnitude of such distortions.
