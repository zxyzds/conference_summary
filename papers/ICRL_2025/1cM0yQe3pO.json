    "abstract": "We study Variational Rectified Flow Matching, a framework that enhances classic rectified flow matching by modeling multi-modal velocity vector-fields. At inference time, classic rectified flow matching 'moves' samples from a source distribution to the target distribution by solving an ordinary differential equation via integration along a velocity vector-field. At training time, the velocity vector-field is learnt by linearly interpolating between coupled samples one drawn from the source and one drawn from the target distribution randomly. This leads to ''ground-truth'' velocity vector-fields that point in different directions at the same location, i.e., the velocity vector-fields are multi-modal/ambiguous. However, since training uses a standard mean-squared-error loss, the learnt velocity vector-field averages ''ground-truth'' directions and isn't multi-modal. Further, averaging leads to integration paths that are more curved while making it harder to fit the target distribution. In contrast, the studied variational rectified flow matching is able to capture the ambiguity in flow directions. We show on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 that the proposed variational rectified flow matching leads to compelling results with fewer integration steps.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel method using variational inference to address the ambiguity of velocity vector fields that classic rectified flow matching fails to capture. By introducing latent variables and modeling ambiguity through a mixture model of velocity vector fields, the method enables more accurate data distribution capture and efficient integration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to existing methods with fewer steps on synthetic data and image datasets."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The proposed method in this paper introduces latent variables and their inference model, enabling the capture of overlapping vector fields when they occur. However, it is necessary to clarify the setting that assumes such overlapping vector fields. The overlap and ambiguity in question here initially seemed to imply that while the flow from a specific $x_0$\u200b to $x_1$\u200b is uniquely determined, there exist different vector fields at a particular time and spatial location that may intersect. However, during inference with the proposed method, a data point $x_0$\u200b is sampled from the source distribution, followed by the sampling of a latent variable, which is then used as the initial value to integrate an ODE based on a vector field determined by it. This implies that there is uncertainty in the direction from the initial value $x_0$\u200b, meaning there is an assumption that it could lead to a different $x_1$\u200b. Is this setting reasonable? The uncertainty involving deterministic flows crossing and the possibility of tracing different flows from the initial value (i.e., the $x_0$ and $x_1$\u200b pairings are not unique) appear to be mixed. The authors should clearly distinguish between these and clarify which aspect they are aiming to address.\n- Considering the above points, while the proposed method may indeed enable faster transitions to the target due to the learned flow being linear even when vector fields overlap, during inference, $z$ is sampled from the prior and thus is not determined solely by $x_0$. As a result, the model could reach a different $x_1$\u200b, which may not be desirable from the perspective of two-sided conditioning flow matching. \n- The proposed method requires an inference model and employs separate encoders for each of $x_0\u200b,x_1$\u200b, and $x_t$\u200b with the same structure as the encoder in $v_\\theta\u200b$. This implies a significantly larger number of learnable parameters compared to existing models, and although the encoders are not used during inference, it is not entirely fair in terms of parameter count relative to previous research (even if the speed remains similar). Therefore, it would be necessary to evaluate the impact of the size of the inference model\u2019s encoders by modifying their size and investigating how it affects performance."

                "value": "The weaknesses of the paper are listed below:\n- The motivation of the paper is unclear, particularly in the Introduction. The statement at line 73, \u201cImportantly, variational rectified flow matching differs in that it enables modeling ambiguity in the data-space-time-space domain, i.e., the goal is a model where flow trajectories can intersect,\u201d does not clarify how allowing flow trajectories to intersect resolves the ambiguity problem.\n- As I understand, using an additional latent variable z when modeling the velocity at (xt,t) can partially address the ambiguity problem, as different values of z capture different modes or sources of variation in the velocity distribution. However, VAEs are known to sometimes experience mode collapse, where the same high-density velocities may be generated from multiple modes of z. How does the proposed method handle this issue? To further address this concern, I suggest including a \u201cdiversity metric\u201d in the experimental protocol to measure the variety of generated samples. \n- Furthermore, I believe RF can address the ambiguity problem by performing multiple rectifications. When training stabilizes, the optimal velocity at each sample xt at time t becomes unique, eliminating ambiguity. Even without rectification, existing methods such as OT-FM can mitigate ambiguity by improving the coupling between x0 and x1, resulting in less ambiguous directions at (xt, t). Are there any theoretical or methodological benefits of the proposed approach compared to these methods? Without such justification, it\u2019s difficult to attribute the improved performance to the additional variable z.\n- Can different values of z affect the visual quality of the generated samples? If x0 is kept constant, does varying z introduce significant variance in the generated samples? Or is there a specific value of z that results in low-quality samples? \n- There is no theoretical guarantee that the proposed approach will achieve a better straight flow when addressing the ambiguity problem."

The empirical evaluation is restricted to MNIST and CIFAR-10, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Extending the evaluation to additional datasets, such as ImageNet 64x64, would improve the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the reported results of VRFM in low NFE regimes (e.g., 104 FID for 2 NFE on CIFAR-10) are less compelling, given the recent advances [1,2,3] in reducing sampling costs in diffusion (or rectified flow) models. For instance, reflow on rectified flow (e.g., 2-rectified flow) achieves a 4.85 FID with a single step [1]. Results showing VRFM\u2019s performance with the reflow technique would provide a more competitive comparison. \n\n- It would be valuable if the authors could provide results on conditional generation setting."
