    "title": "Fair Clustering in the Sliding Window Model",
    "abstract": "We study streaming algorithms for proportionally fair clustering (a notion originally suggested by Chierichetti et al. (2017) in the sliding window model. We show that although there exist efficient streaming algorithms exist in the insertion-only model, surprisingly no algorithm can achieve finite ratio without violating the fairness constraint in sliding window. Hence, the problem of fair clustering is a rare separation between the insertion-only streaming model and the sliding window model. On the other hand, we show that if the fairness constraint by a multiplicative $\\varepsilon$ factor, there exists a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate sliding window algorithm that uses $\\text{poly}(k\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log n)$ space. This achieves essentially the best parameters (up to degree in the polynomial) provided the aforementioned lower bound. We also implement a number of empirical evaluations on real datasets to complement our theoretical results.",

                "value": "This paper studies the fair clustering problem in the sliding window model, where the goal is to maintain an approximation for clustering the most recent data points while satisfying proportional fairness constraints. Specifically, given a $k$-clustering instance in the form of a data stream, the goal of this paper is to achieve a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal fair clustering for the dataset defined by the sliding window with minimum space complexity. However, ensuring fairness under strict space constraints in a data stream poses significant challenges. To tackle the challenges in sliding window model, this paper proposes an online assignment-preserving coreset construction method. The proposed method first reduces clustering in the sliding window model to an online coreset construction via a standard merge-and-reduce technique. Then, this paper introduces an algorithm for assignment-preserving coreset construction that processes each window as a suffix of the input stream at a particular time $t$. Finally, by constructing the coreset in reverse order across all time steps from $1$ to $t$, the resulting prefix of this online coreset serves as a valid coreset for the sliding window, achieving $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the fair clustering problem in sliding window model. This paper shows that if the fairness constraint is allowed to be violated by a multiplicative factor, there exists a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate sliding window algorithm that uses only $poly(k\\epsilon^{\u22121}log n)$ space. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets further validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, complementing the theoretical results."

Although the theoretical part of this paper is sound and solid, the experimental part is highly insufficient.\n- At least, two additional types of baselines should be compared: (1) the algorithms for sliding-window clustering without fairness such as those in [Borassi et al., 2020; Epasto et al., 2022;  Woodruff et al., 2023], which indicates \"the price of fairness\", and the algorithms for offline and insert-only streaming with fairness such as those in [Chierichetti et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019], which provides lower bounds of clustering costs and presents the challenge of the sliding-window model. Uniform sampling is a too-weak baseline for coreset-based clustering.\n- How about the performance of the proposed algorithms on datasets with higher dimensions (e.g., [Census](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/116/us+census+data+1990) and synthetic data in about 10-100 dimensions)?\n- Details about experimental setup and implementation (such as dataset preprocessing and code availability) are concise.\n- The efficiency results (e.g., running time and coreset size) and scalability (e.g., performance w.r.t. k and d) are not provided.
