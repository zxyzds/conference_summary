    "abstract": "Image watermark techniques provide an effective way to assert ownership, deter misuse, and trace content sources, which has become increasingly essential in the era of large generative models. A critical attribute of watermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this paper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively nullifying the state of the art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight involves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian noise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and spatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.",

This method  starts with noising the latent representation of a watermarked image instead.\n3.

Novel Idea: The method CtrlRegen is a new method for removing image watermarks using controllable diffusion models, starting from clean Gaussian noise. This enables it to handle high perturbation attacks which the previous methods ex: Regen were unable to.\n2. Creative combinations of existing ideas: ControlNet like spatial control network and semantic control adapter to guide the denoising process, ensuring consistency between the original and cleaned images. \n3. CtrlRegen+ enables an adjustable regeneration scheme - it allows for varying degrees of watermark destruction to counter different watermark strengths.\n\nClarity: The paper clearly explains the main ideas and method, provides context and presents quantitative results and comparisons in a clear manner.\n\nQuality:\n1. Results: The method outperforms previous regeneration approaches (Regen and Rinse) and demonstrates this through quantitative evaluation on both low and high perturbation watermarks. Multiple metrics are used to asses visual similarity and quality such as CLIP-FID, PSNR, Q-Align, LIQE beside evaluations related to watermark detection performance.\n2. Consideration for use cases: The introduction of CtrlRegen+ shows consideration for different use cases and watermark strengths."
