    "title": "Latent Diffusion Planning for Imitation Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in robotic imitation learning has been enabled by policy architectures that scale to complex visuomotor tasks, multimodal distributions, and large datasets. However, these methods rely on supervised learning of actions from expert demonstrations, which can be challenging to scale. We propose Latent Diffusion Planning, which forecasts future states as well as actions via diffusion. This objective can scalably leverage heterogeneous data sources and provides a denser supervision signal for learning. To plan over images, we learn a compact latent space through a variational autoencoder. We then train a planner to forecast future latent states, and an inverse dynamics model to extract actions from the plans. As planning is separated from action prediction, LDP can leverage suboptimal or action-free data to improve performance in low demonstration regimes. On simulated visual robotic manipulation tasks, LDP outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches as they cannot leverage such additional data.",

In contrast to video prediction methods for planning, this paper plans in a latent space (learned using a VAE with an image reconstruction objective) which is much faster as it does not require time-consuming frame generation."

The paper is well-written, with the key contributions listed clearly in the introduction.

The idea of inverse dynamics prediction is not novel, however this particular approach that leverages diffusion models for both components (planning and control) is novel."

These claims do not seem to be well-supported in the experiments. The scope of heterogeneity is another set of sub-optimal teleoperation demonstrations in the same domain (MuJoCo simulations).\n2. The authors experimented with 3 simulated tasks with no experiments on a real robot, which leaves the question open as to whether this method will scale to a real robotics setup."

Have the authors considered training on large-scale video datasets, rather than just sim-only robot videos? Will this method be able to leverage that much heterogeneity in the datasets?\n2. The main contribution of UniPi (if I understand correctly) was combinatorial generalization to unseen language instructions. Can the LDP leverage their video prediction model to handle such generalization to novel goals?\n3. Can the authors report performance using a baseline BC-RNN model on the datasets they curated for their tasks?\n4. How many rollouts were performed to compute success rates? Sorry if I missed, but I could not find this in the paper.\n5. The tasks that this paper used are part of a suite has multiple other tasks such as coffee, tool hang, mug cleanup, etc. Why were just the 3 simulated tasks chosen for experimentation?"

Furthermore, the background for these tasks is relatively simple. More complex scenarios would make the latent representations hard to learn, which could be challenging for LDP.\n- In the experiments, the authors take a single-view image as the input. However, in many other simulation tasks or real-world tasks, multiple cameras including an in-hand camera are employed. It would be good to see how the LDP scale with multiple cameras.\n- The idea of training the latent planner on action-free data is interesting.

Real-world experiments would greatly enhance the quality of the paper."

It is usually used for disentangled representation learning and the $\\beta$ could influence the reconstructions.\n- In the imitation learning demonstrations, the differences between two frames are very small, which means the latent from the next frame could provide little information. How does this architecture perform better than imitation learning with sub-goals?\n- If the IDM takes the full predicted state latent, would the LDP perform better or worse?\n- What is the length of state latent in the planner? When comparing LDP with DiffusionPolicy, do the authors use the same length of actions?\n- Why does the LDP perform poorly on the PushT task?\n- If using multiple cameras, the LDP might require multiple diffusion planners which could be hard to train and do inference. How do the authors expect to solve this? Further, I am wondering if the planner could perform well on the in-hand camera.\n- The authors mentioned the speed drawbacks of the LDP. What is the inference time for the LDP?"
