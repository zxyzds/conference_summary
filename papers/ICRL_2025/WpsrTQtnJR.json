    "title": "Efficient Sparsification of Densely Connected Clusters",
    "abstract": "When modelling a real-world dataset as a graph, groups of highly correlated data items correspond to densely connected vertex sets (clusters), and efficient algorithms that find these clusters have broad applications in various data analysis tasks. In this paper we study densely connected clusters in graphs and introduce two sparsification algorithms that preserve the structure of  these clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We show that our algorithms significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while preserving their effectiveness.",

The theoretical analysis and the probability guarantee makes the methodology promising; the nearly-linear running time makes the algorithm applicable. \n3.

In fact, I still do not fully understand what \"k pairs of densely connected clusters\" actually means, I can understand there are k disjoint subsets of vertices in the graph and the induced subgraph of each subset of vertex may form a cluster (i.e., a densely connected subgraph), but where do you get k pairs of densely connected clusters from k disjoint subsets of vertices? Therefore, it is very difficult for me to understand the paper when the important concepts are not properly defined. I suggest the authors to clearly define all notations and concepts the first time they are introduced in the paper. \n\nThe significance of the proposed algorithms is not clear, i.e., why the results are important theoretically and practically?  It would be good if the authors could clearly explain the significance of the proposed method using a running example, e.g., given an input graph, what does the algorith output and show that the output is important.\n\nThe experiments were conducted on synthetic graphs only with k = 2. It would be more convincing to show the results on representative real graphs and large values of k. Another question is that k is actually unknown in practice, how do the authors address this problem?"
