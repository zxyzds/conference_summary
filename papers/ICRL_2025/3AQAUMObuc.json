    "title": "Online importance sampling for stochastic gradient optimization",
    "abstract": "Machine learning optimization commonly relies on stochastic gradient descent, where the accuracy of gradient estimation is crucial for model performance. Rather than relying on uniform sampling, importance sampling can improve accuracy by focusing on data points that have more significant impact on learning. However, existing methods for importance sampling face challenges with computational efficiency and integration into practical machine learning workflows.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel adaptive metric based on the loss derivative wrt the network output that can be used for both importance sampling and data pruning. Our metric not only enhances gradient accuracy by prioritizing influential data points but also enables effective pruning by identifying and removing data that contributes minimally to training. We propose an efficient adaptive algorithm that leverages this metric with minimal computational overhead. Our evaluations on classification and regression tasks demonstrate improved convergence and reduced training data requirements, validating the efficacy of our approach.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a new adaptive method of importance sampling for stochastic gradient estimation in multi-class classification. The sampling weights of this method do not depend on the costly full backpropagation on each data point. The importance sampling weights can also be used for data pruning, which can be further combined with the importance sampling for gradient estimation. The authors conducted experiments on classification tasks to verify the effectiveness of their algorithm compared to SGD with uniform sampling and previous importance sampling methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- A major concern with the importance sampling method proposed in this paper is that it remains \"loss-based\". To be specific, the weight of each data $x$ is proportional to $\\\\|\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x)}{\\partial m(x,\\theta)}\\\\|\\_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^J(s\\_j(x) - y\\_j(x))^2}$, where $s\\_j(x)$ is the predicted probability of data $x$ belongs to class $j$ while $y\\_j(x)$ is the groundtruth. Thus, the importance sampling weight of data $x$ can be viewed as its $\\ell_2$ loss on label prediction. However, it is unclear how this approach relates to the theoretically optimal importance sampling weight based on gradient norms. If the gradient w.r.t. the output does not take the specific form as in the logistic loss, does it still make sense to sample based on the norm of the gradient w.r.t the output?\n- There is no formal convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. So the algorithm remains heuristic. \n- The experiments in this paper were not repeated with different random seeds, resulting in a lack of error bars on reported values and curves. This makes their experimental results less reliable."

It is true that the methods proposed in the earlier years have the problem of computation efficiency, but nowadays there are many methods with little overhead.\n\n\n1. The proposed method has limited novelty. While the authors claim that the derivative wrt to the network output is different from what is used in (Katharopoulos&Fleuret,2018), from my understanding, it is pretty similar if not identical, and there are many other works that utilize something similar like the EL2N score in [1]. Even if there is some difference, the novelty seems limited and the changes are not argued or justified. (Like the difference may just be taking the derivative to the pre- or post- activation output)\n2. The experiment comparison is weak. They do not compare with some more recent work like [2]. Additionally, they do not compare with some simple and already used baseline in practice. For example, random shuffling with a reduced number of epochs is often stronger than many of these importance sampling methods. (This is sometimes much stronger than uniform sampling as the samples won\u2019t repeat within an epoch. Also, it is important that the learning rate schedule changes so that the learning rate decays)\n\n\n\n[1] Paul, M., Ganguli, S., & Dziugaite, G. K. (2021).

                "value": "1. Can you clarify the novelty of your proposed metric and why should it be better than those used in the literature?\n2. Can you add more comparisons in the experiments with more recent works ([2] and a lot more) and also the most simple random reshuffling with a reduced number of epochs?\n3. Can you add more details regarding sampling with or without replacement? It is said within a batch, it is sampled without replacement, so the samples will not repeat. But what about for different batches from the same epoch. To me, it seems like samples can repeat within an epoch, and this can lead to inferior performance compared to those will not repeat within an epoch such as [2]."

I fail to understand this renormalization and what $p(x,y)$ refers to here: is it the data-generating process or importance sampling weights? Could you explain and define $p(x,y)$.\nBesides, there are some assumptions that are not clearly stated and appear here and there in the text, for example, that the model is Lipschitz (Section 4.1).  \n\n2) The proposed metric seems to be the same as the EL2N proposed in Deep Learning on a Data Diet, Paul et al.
