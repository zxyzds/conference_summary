    "title": "Receptor-Specific Diffusion Model: Towards Generating Protein-Protein Structures with Customized Perturbing and Sampling",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep generative models have signi\ufb01cantly facilitated protein-ligand structure design, which is crucial in protein engineering. However, recent generative approaches based on diffusion models in this field usually start sampling from a unified distribution, failing to capture the intricate biochemical differences between receptors. This may limits their capacity to generate reliable ligands for the corresponding receptors. Moreover, the current sampling process incurs a heavy computational burden and inefficiency, which further escalates the training demands on the model. To this end, we introduce a novel diffusion model with customized perturbing and sampling for the ligand design targeting the specific receptor, named as Receptor-Specific Diffusion Model (RSDM). In particular, the receptor-specific information is used to tailor fine-grained sampling distributions via changing the noise for customized perturbing. Meantime, we refine the sampling process using a predefined schedule to perform stepwise denoising and gradually decrease the influence of the receptor's guidence in the ligand generation for customized sampling. The experimental reaults indicate that RSDM is highly competitive with state-of-the-art learning-based models, including recent models like ElliDock and DiffDock-PP. Additionally, RSDM stands out for its faster inference speed compared with all baseline methods, highlighting its potential for generating dependable protein-ligand.",

                "value": "This paper addressed challenges in protein-ligand structure design facilitated by generative models, specifically targeting inefficiencies and generalizations in existing diffusion-based approaches. The authors proposed the Receptor-Specific Diffusion Model (RSDM), which introduces a novel method of customized perturbing and sampling to more accurately generate ligands tailored to specific receptors. RSDM uses receptor-specific information to adjust the sampling distribution, altering noise for customized perturbations, and employs a stepwise denoising schedule to refine ligand generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RSDM is highly competitive with leading models like ElliDock and DiffDock-PP, while also offering faster inference speeds. This positions RSDM as a promising tool for reliable and efficient protein-ligand generation."

                "value": "The key aspects of the diffusion model method are questionable and confusing:\n\n1, For the \u201creceptor-specific\u201d section:\nThe paper achieves this \"receptor\" specification by adding the mean position of the binding pocket to the mean of the Gaussian in the prior distribution and gradually decreasing its magnitude during sampling. To me, this approach seems like it is steering the center of the sampled ligand protein to remain in the pocket center. However, in most molecular protein docking and protein-protein docking problems, this can be done by simply removing the Center of Mass (CoM) for the ligand during sampling, which makes it confusing why it is necessary to complicate the process by adding this mean into the prior distribution and modifying the training and sampling processes. Also, Figure 2 shows that incorporating a personalized mean into the sampling distribution reduces the RMSD of alpha carbon considerably. However, I did not see any CoM removal in the training algorithm, so the difference between RSDM and w/o PSD groups in RMSD could simply be because the mean of the ligand is not re-centered.\n\n2, For \u201cstep-by-step data purification\u201d:\nIn Equation 8, $\\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}|\\mu_{\\theta}(x_t^{(l)},t)-\\frac{\\gamma_t}{T}x^{(r)},\\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_t^{(l)},t))$ indicates that $x_{t-1}$ is sampled from this parameterized normal distribution. However, prior to this equation, the authors mention that $x_{t-1}$ is directly predicted by $f_{\\theta}(x_t^{(l)},t)$. These two expressions on how to obtain $x_{t-1}$ are contradictory; if you directly predict $x_{t-1}$ from the previous time step, how could it be equivalent to sampling from a parameterized distribution as described in Equation 8? There is no sampling involved if you are directly predicting. I would appreciate if the authors could clarify whether they used sampling to obtain $x_{t-1}$ or if it is deterministically obtained by network prediction.\n\nFurthermore, the authors introduce this \u201cstep-by-step data purification\u201d by starting with the criticism, \u201cSuch the reverse process (predict $x_0$ with the score network) poses a challenge to the model\u2019s predictive ability and complicates the training process.\u201d I don\u2019t see why this challenges the model\u2019s predictive ability. In diffusion or score-based models, predicting $x_0$, $\\epsilon_t$, or $v_t = \\alpha_t x_0 + \\sigma_t \\epsilon$ are three commonly used spaces to parameterize diffusion models. If you directly predict $x_{t-1}$ from $x_{t}$, then your network is no longer directly or indirectly parameterizing the score $\\nabla_{x_t} \\log P(x_t)$; it is directly predicting a sample instead of the gradient of the probability distribution, so it is no longer a score-based or diffusion model. \n\nTaking a step back, regardless of the confusion discussed above, even if the paper claims that directly predicting $x_t$ is better than $x_0$, I did not see any ablation study showing that predicting $x_t$ improves performance over predicting $x_0$, given the authors' criticism that predicting $x_0$ challenges the model\u2019s predictive ability."
