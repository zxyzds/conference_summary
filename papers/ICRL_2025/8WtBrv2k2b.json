    "title": "Dynamic Inhomogeneous Quantum Resource Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "A central challenge in quantum information science and technology is achieving real-time estimation and feedforward control of quantum systems. This challenge is compounded by the inherent inhomogeneity of quantum resources, such as qubit properties and controls, and their intrinsically probabilistic nature. This leads to stochastic challenges in error detection and probabilistic outcomes in processes such as heralded remote entanglement. Given these complexities, optimizing the construction of quantum resource states is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we address the quantum resource scheduling issue by formulating the problem and simulating it within a digitized environment, allowing the exploration and development of agent-based optimization strategies. We employ reinforcement learning agents within this probabilistic setting and introduce a new framework utilizing a Transformer model that emphasizes self-attention mechanisms for pairs of qubits. This approach facilitates dynamic scheduling by providing real-time, next-step guidance. Our method significantly improves the performance of quantum systems, achieving more than a 3$\\times$ improvement over rule-based agents, and establishes an innovative framework that improves the joint design of physical and control systems for quantum applications in communication, networking, and computing.",

Reasons for NP-hardness are given that are no real reasons and do not imply any NP-hardness proof. \"Quantum\" does not automatically make things harder.\n- The beginning of the introduction is not well connected to the main content of the paper and has a lot of trailing references to the appendix.\n- All matrices appear to be named \"M\" with some index. The variable name \"N\" is similarly overused etc. A better naming scheme would greatly aid understanding.\n\nIn a similar vein, I would greatly recommend introducing the problems more formally. The structure of the RL problem is just assumed and roughly derived from the underlying physics problem. Why is there no mapping to the standard MDP definition? This makes it hard to grasp the core of the problem.\n\nA more standard formulation would also allow to apply a much greater range of standard algorithm running on the problem.\n\nMost importantly, while outperformance is measured, there is not given a succinct reason. How does the approach perform on the \"basis problem\" MWCSP? Why is it not tested there?\n\nWhile only very few formal errors persist, all citations are formatted incorrectly."

It is crucial for the authors to explain in more detail the process of acquiring this information and the associated resource expenditures, particularly when the framework is to be applied to an unknown quantum system. This transparency is essential for assessing the practicality and feasibility of the framework in real-world scenarios.\n- The framework appears to require real-time characterization for the maximum cluster size and the error associated with each established entanglement. I am curious about the cost and difficulty of obtaining this information in real quantum systems.\n- The description of the framework is unclear to me. The authors should not assume that readers are familiar with their terminology. There are several points that need to be clarified further. For instance, what is the state matrix? What is the relationship between the state matrix and the pre-characterized system information? What does \"the scheduling event is complete\" mean? How do $f_1$ and $f_2$ function, and what are their inputs? How is the reward for the agent calculated?\n- I believe that more details on the training process need to be provided in the manuscript.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- There are some misleading sentences in the related works section. For instance, the authors stated, \"The Transformer model, for example, has been effectively used in various applications such as ... and quantum state reconstruction (Carrasquilla et al., 2019).\" However, I do not believe that Carrasquilla et al. (2019) utilized the Transformer model in their method."

This is an extremely challenging problem, as the optimal control and scheduling of quantum resources is affected by the inhomogeneous nature of the underlying quantum resources, their pairwise interactions and probabilistic outcomes of remote entanglement. Optimising quantum resource state production is an NP-hard problem, which the authors tackle by simulating quantum resource scheduling in a digitised environment. Connections are made to the Minimum Weight Connected Subgraph Problem and the authors introduce a novel approach using reinforcement learning agents and a Transformer model, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to optimise qubit pair scheduling. This method enhances entangled resource state construction, yielding over a 3\u00d7 improvement compared to traditional rule-based agents, with applications for a variety of quantum systems.

Moreover, the difficulty of the problem is well put by framing it as a more complicated version of the MWCSP. The applicability of this to various hardware architectures (photonics, ions, atoms, spins etc..) for networked quantum computing architectures also underscores the relevance of this work.\n\nMoreover, the application of a transformer with different encodings (pre-information, dynamic and position) is a creative approach to solve a challenging problem in the control and design of large scale quantum experiments which has not emerged previously in the literature.\n\nThe benchmarks provided are comprehensive and clear.

A more detailed analysis and perhaps discussion of the limitations of particular approaches as the number of qubits scale would be extremely helpful, particularly for the Results shown in Table 3. This would make the analysis of the experiment more complete and strengthen the overall paper.\n\nThe manuscript is not as clear as it could be and the framing of the problem is not as strong as it could be either. In the abstract the authors claim a 3x improvement over rule based agents but no reference to a metric with which this improvement is quantified is made. Moreover, the authors use a quoted upper bound in fidelity from IBM ( a superconducting device), but the general networked architecture seems to be based on \"a quantum control architecture tailored to a unique class of quantum resources featuring a spin-photon (Appendix A.8, Fig.6) interface conducive to remote entanglement routing\" and has applications to trapped ions or neutral atoms. Moreover, the reference (IBM Website) does not provide any details on this upper bound used in the manuscript. Fidelities for networked architectures generally seem to be lower than this as shown in Ref. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.110501 (fidelity of 94%) and so some more justification or a clearer explanation would strengthen the manuscript. Additionally, the authors work simulates real physical interactions and the success of the proposed Transformer-on-QuPairs model relies on inhomogeneity in the fidelities (i.e. a high sigma(F)), but little discussion, of why such inhomogeneity arises in physical systems, nor any reference to existing work which shows qubit inhomogeneity is made. Providing a stronger case for the relevance of the highly inhomogeneous fidelity scenario would strengthen the benchmarks significantly.\n\nThe results in table 2 are somewhat confusing. It seems as though for a perfectly homogeneous fidelity, the different methods should perform exactly the same, but there are small but non-negligible differences. Is this a real result? Given the two uncertain (two sigma deviation) is larger than the absolute differences across methods it is not clear how to interpret these results. Some more clarity from the authors would help."

Could examples and explicit references be provided.\n\nCan the authors further justify the use of an upper bound in fidelity from superconducting qubits for a networked architecture?\n\nWhy do the methods in Table 2 show small differences in performance even for perfectly homogeneous fidelities, and how should these results be interpreted given the uncertainties?\n\nWhy is the static minimum spanning tree (MST) approach... anticipated to be an effective heuristic when the quantum system\u2019s coherence time is indefinitely long or has a deterministic success probability during entanglement attempts.?
