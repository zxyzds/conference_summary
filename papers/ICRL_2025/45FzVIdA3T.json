    "title": "EDM: Equirectangular Projection-Oriented Dense Kernelized Feature Matching",
    "abstract": "We introduce the first learning-based dense matching algorithm, termed Equirectangular Projection-Oriented Dense Kernelized Feature Matching (EDM), specifically designed for omnidirectional images. Equirectangular projection (ERP) images, with their large fields of view, are particularly suited for dense matching techniques that aim to establish comprehensive correspondences across images. However, ERP images are subject to significant distortions, which we address by leveraging the spherical camera model and geodesic flow refinement in the dense matching method. To further mitigate these distortions, we propose spherical positional embeddings based on 3D Cartesian coordinates of the feature grid. Additionally, our method incorporates bidirectional transformations between spherical and Cartesian coordinate systems during refinement, utilizing a unit sphere to improve matching performance. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves notable performance enhancements, with improvements of +26.72 and +42.62 in AUC@5\u00b0 on the Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D datasets, respectively.",

The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the dense sphere image matching task and outperforms previous sphere matching methods and perspective matching methods by a large margin."

Although the authors demonstrated in Table 3 that these optimizations significantly improve performance over DKM in omnidirectional image matching, the work does not achieve a breakthrough in the dense matching framework, limiting its potential for broader insights and inspiration.\n\n2.

It would have been interesting to see how EDM fares against SphereGlue there.\n- Some design choices were not clear to me. For example, on line 261-262 it is stated that linear refinement on the sphere is impossible, so it must be projected to equirectangular 2D space before the refinement. To me, an obvious ablation would be to compare this to a simple projection operator, i.e. $\\hat{u}^{\\ell} = {\\rm normalize} (\\hat{u}^{\\ell+1} + \\triangle \\hat{u}^{\\ell+1})$.\n- Possibly minor complaint. The authors work in the DKM framework where global matching is seen as a coordinate regression problem, however it can also be seen simply in terms of dense correlation between the features (where the network would not need to \"see\" any embeddings). It would have been nice to see a comparison to such an approach (i.e. instead either regressing the correlation vector as in e.g. PDCNET, or using a cross-view Transformer as in LoFTR.)"

It's also seemingly pretty certain in the bottom example of a cupboard that does not seem to be covisible. The reviewer is wondering if the authors could explain a bit more about the confidence (under/over) of the model.\n- The reviewer did not find a definition of AUC in the paper. Is it AUC of the relative pose error as in most matching works? Could be good to include in the appendix, especially as ICLR readers may be less familiar with the topic."
