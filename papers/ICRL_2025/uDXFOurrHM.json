    "title": "Optimal Partial Graph Matching",
    "abstract": "Partial graph matching addresses the limitations of traditional graph matching by allowing some nodes to remain unmatched, making it applicable to more complex scenarios. However, this flexibility introduces additional complexity, as both the subset of nodes to match and the optimal mapping must be determined. While recent studies have explored deep learning techniques for partial graph matching, a significant limitation remains: the absence of an optimization objective that fully captures the problem\u2019s intrinsic nature while enabling efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for partial graph matching, inspired by optimal partial transport. Our approach formulates an objective that enables partial assignments while incorporating matching biases, using weighted total variation as the divergence function to guarantee optimal partial assignments. We  employ the Hungarian algorithm to achieve efficient, exact solutions with cubic time complexity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce a robust optimization objective that balances matched and unmatched nodes; (ii) we establish a connection between partial graph matching and the linear sum assignment problem, enabling efficient solutions; (iii) we propose a deep graph matching architecture with a novel partial matching loss, providing an end-to-end solution. The empirical evaluations on standard graph matching benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

                "value": "1) The method requires setting a series of hyperparameters tailored for the domain, which might be difficult in practice. For example, by my understanding, the parameter \\rho seems quite important and encodes the amount of partiality. This is quite an assumption, and it would be nice to find some heuristics to fix it automatically (e.g., the ratio of the number of nodes or the graph radius, etc.). Could you offer a comment on this, and in case a possible heuristic? Is it possible to explicitly relate \\rho to the amount of partiality?\n2) Since this work is a bit outside my direct expertise, I had a hard time grasping all the details, especially building an intuition. The paper itself does not show visual results, and then it is not straightforward to understand how concretely the proposed methodology differentiates in terms of artifacts (e.g., is the error caused by wrong matching bias and partiality identification, or more about mismatching?) would be interesting to add some qualitative examples, especially for keypoint, that is particularly easy to interpret. Did you observe any specific failure mode or particularly challenging setting? Could you provide a visualization to support the intuition about the main source of the error?"

In particular, the paper suggest to use spectral properties to infer properties on subgraphs, and also correspondence. Similarly \"A functional representation for graph matching\", Wang et al., PAMI 2019, propose to use spectral properties to compute matching on (full) graphs. I believe a discussion on this line of works would be interesting.\n3) How does the method perform in case of rewiring of the partiality?"

The connection between optimal transport and the graph matching problem is already well-established, making it seem redundant to re-establish this connection in the partial setting.\n\n2. The use of the term \u201coptimal\u201d in the title may be misleading. A significant challenge in partial matching is setting thresholds ($\\rho$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ in this paper) to eliminate redundant points. The paper assumes these thresholds are predefined, which undermines the rigor of claiming their results as \u201coptimal\u201d.\n\n3. PascalVOC is still the most important benchmark for the graph matching community, including its result only in the appendix does not seem appropriate, especially when this method does not do better on this benchmark.\n\n4. The paper omits two critical references [1,2], both of which have achieved better results on PascalVOC.\n\n[1] Nurlanov et al., \"Universe Points Representation Learning for Partial Multi-Graph Matching\"\n\n[2] Jiang et al., \"Learning Universe Model for Partial Matching Networks over Multiple Graphs\""

It would be important to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\n2. What would the performance of other methods look like if they simply applied a thresholding scheme on their cost matrix similar to this study? An ablation study would be appreciated.\n\n3. How is the parameter $\\rho$ chosen? Is it chosen by some heuristics? Fig. 2 (middle) suggests that $\\rho$ values supporting better performance are quite narrow (0.35-0.4), and these values vary across different tasks. Determining this parameter is one of the most challenging aspects of partial matching, so it is essential to understand how to set $\\rho$ without extensive trial and error."

The main contribution of the paper is to formulate the partial graph matching problem into an optimal partial transport problem, which is not new [1,2] and is a common relaxation of the original quadratic objective of graph matching involving both vertices and edges constraints (into a linear assignment problem).\n2. Line 065 is not 100% accurate since there are some efficient algorithms (e.g. [3] is quite intuitive and easy to implement as the k-LAP is transformed into a standard LAP that can be efficiently solved by the Hungarian algorithm) targeting towards k-assignment problem. As such, manually filtering out infeasible assignments with a hard threshold in Theorem 5.1 is not necessary.\n3. Some important references are missing [4,5].\n4. The objective of Eq(9) is almost equivalent to the first order term of Koopmans-Beckmann\u2019s QAP with partial matching constraints in Eq(10), and the network design is the same as GCAN, together with the common linear solver Hungarian algorithm making the contributions both network design and optimization insight a bit marginal. In fact, one promising and more insightful way for the paper to stand out among others is to explicit formulate graph edges into optimal transport objective or constraints rather only implicitly involved into feature aggregation by GCN.\n\nTo conclude, the paper proposed an optimal transport objective with partial matching constraints for partial graph matching problem.
