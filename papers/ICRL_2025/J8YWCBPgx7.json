    "title": "PostEdit: Posterior Sampling for Efficient Zero-Shot Image Editing",
    "abstract": "In the field of image editing, three core challenges persist: controllability, background preservation, and efficiency. Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.",

The subfigure \"Our Posterior Sampling Process\" in Fig. 1 is difficult to understand. It is unclear what exactly it is meant to represent. Additionally, how does it highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithm?\n\n2. The authors mention that the proposed algorithm runs in less than 2 seconds, but it is not clear how many denoising steps are actually performed. In Algorithm 1, the values of N and n are not specified. These details are crucial because if the number of denoising steps is high, it could naturally lead to slower execution. It would also be beneficial to visualize some intermediate results for better clarity.\n\n3. Regarding the editing process, how is the mask generated and provided? There is a lack of details on this aspect.\n\n4. The current editing experiments only involve replacing a few words in the prompt, which seems quite limited. Does the method support more extensive editing operations? More explanation and additional experiments would be appreciated."

Baselines: The experimental comparisons do not include state-of-the-art methods such as SPD Inversion [1], and Guide-and-Rescale [2]. Including these baselines is crucial to substantiate the claims of superiority. \n\nb. Ablation Study: The ablation study lacks quantitative results to further support the analysis. Numerical data on the effectiveness of each component (e.g., posterior sampling vs. inversion process) would add robustness to the conclusions.\n\nc. User Study: Given that image editing quality can be somewhat subjective, a user study would be helpful to establish the practical effectiveness of the proposed method more convincingly.\n\nd. Complex Images: All the reconstruction results shown in the paper involve images with a single object and simple layouts. However, some inversion methods struggle with reconstructing images containing multiple detailed objects. Could you provide reconstruction results for such complex images to strengthen your claims about the method's versatility?\n\n\nReferences for Missing Baselines: \n[1] Li R B, Li R H, Guo S, Zhang L.

                "value": "1. The reviewer encountered several points in the algorithm that were difficult to understand, raising the possibility of inaccuracies. The reviewer requests that the authors provide clear responses to the following questions: (1) In line 4, does \\(z_0\\) bear no relation to the original image, given that \\(z_N\\) is derived from pure noise? (2) Can lines 6 to 9 be interpreted as a re-generation of \\(z_0\\)? (3) Is the alignment with the original image (i.e., \\(z_{in}\\)) genuinely implemented only in lines 12 to 14? (4) In line 15, the reviewer finds the superscript \\(N\\) on \\(z^{(N)}\\) unusual, as it would conventionally be \\(m\\) in this context. Additionally, the reviewer is puzzled by the disappearance of \\(z_{\\tau_{i-1}}\\) in the next loop iteration. These uncertainties make the methodology difficult to follow, and the reviewer suggests clarifying these points for future readers.\n\n2. Regarding the essence of the proposed method, the reviewer interprets it as generating an image that aligns with the target prompt, followed by posterior probability correction techniques that reintroduce information from the original image via weighted blending, masking, or similar means. The reviewer has experience with studies on posterior probability and would appreciate confirmation.\n\n3. The reviewer finds the reported speed and runtime of the proposed method particularly perplexing. Given the numerous loops in the algorithm, it is unclear how the method achieves a runtime of only 1.2 seconds. As far as the reviewer is aware, most training-free image editing methods, even with fewer layers in the algorithmic structure, typically take tens of seconds. Could the authors clarify where this dramatic time saving is achieved? Beyond seeing a 1.2-second result, the reviewer would like a breakdown of time components comparing this method to other training-free methods.\n\n4. The number of baseline methods in the comparative experiments is insufficient, with few comparisons to state-of-the-art training-based methods. This lack of comparison feels inequitable, as training-based methods have become well-established for image editing, showing robustness and speed (e.g., InstructP2P, SmartEdit, SEED-X-Edit). The reviewer questions what specific contributions are offered by the proposed training-free method.\n\n5. The proposed method involves an overwhelming number of hyperparameters; there appear to be countless hyperparameters even within the algorithm section alone. The reviewer believes that a detailed hyperparameter sensitivity analysis is necessary to ensure that the model's robustness is not significantly affected by the choice of hyperparameters. From the reviewer's experience, many training-free methods require intricate hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal results. Therefore, the reviewer requests that the authors provide the specific hyperparameters used for each image in the experimental section.\n\n6. The related work section appears to reference too few relevant studies in the image editing field, which is rapidly evolving. The reviewer suggests expanding this section by referencing additional survey papers to strengthen the literature review."
