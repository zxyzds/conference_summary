    "title": "Dynamic Matching Utilizing Latent Factor Modeling",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the supply-demand matching problem on dynamic platforms, focusing on optimizing matching strategies by learning workers' attributes when their types are uncertain and constantly changing. To address this problem, we introduce a latent factor model and a multi-centroid grouping penalty mechanism to predict latent factors of workers and perform dynamic matching. Our approach operates in two stages: the first stage fits latent feature vectors for workers and jobs and groups them using historical data; the second stage utilizes these latent features for dynamic matching. Our research demonstrates that the introduced model can adapt to the dynamic changes of the platform with good predictive consistency and group robustness, and improves overall operational benefit through continuous optimization of matching results. We provide simulation experiments and a real case study using kidney exchange data and compare our model with a point process model to show that our approach performs well on dynamic platform matching problems.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- While the earlier parts of the paper are well-written, the later sections feel somewhat rushed and confusing at parts.  See below for my specific comments.\n-  The notation used throughout the paper is somewhat difficult to understand, and there are inconsistencies.  For example, the sets associated with the group membership of workers and jobs are introduced as $\\mathbf{V}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$, but then subsequently referred to using $V$ and $U$, respectively.  Fixing these and any other inconsistencies (e.g., $A \\leftrightarrow \\mathbf{A}$, $B \\leftrightarrow \\mathbf{B}$, $L \\leftrightarrow \\mathcal{L}$, $G \\leftrightarrow \\mathcal{G}$) would help with the paper\u2019s readability.  Streamlining notation wherever possible would also be appreciated.\n- While I did not spend a large amount of time looking at them, the proofs in the Appendix seem to skip several steps.  E.g., on line 655, the proof of Theorems 1 and 3 claims \u201cWith the choice of $\\lambda_n$ as mentioned, we can show: $\\Vert \\hat{\\Theta} - \\Theta^\\star \\Vert = O_p (n^{-1/2})$\u201d, which implies the theorem statement.  However, $\\Vert \\hat{\\Theta} - \\Theta^\\star \\Vert$ was not mentioned anywhere before this statement in the proof, so it is a little unclear where this is coming from.  Similarly, on line 692, the proof claims that \u201cAnd as $n$ approaches positive infinity, $R(\\hat{V},  \\hat{U})$ goes to $1$\u201d.  The justification for this claim is not clear from the preceding lines.\n- The experimental evaluation in Section 6.1 feels somewhat lacking to me \u2014 see specific comments below:\n    - The last sentence of Section 6.1 states \u201cWe found that the LFGP model performs well in handling binary labels, but its accuracy decreases when dealing with more label types.\u201d  I appreciate the acknowledgement of the model\u2019s limitations, but I do not see the corresponding evidence for this claim?  In the setup, I do not see any characterizations of the label types considered that would suggest how this comparison and conclusion was reached.\n    - The setting considered seems small and somewhat arbitrary when compared with a real application to matching markets.\n- In Section 6.2, I appreciate the increased detail in the setup description for the real-world data.  Including evaluations on this data set somewhat addresses my concerns with the experiment in Section 6.1.  \n    - However, I am a little confused about the amount of detail dedicated to evaluating the LFGP model on this task \u2014 as far as I can tell, the only reported performance metric for LFGP on the kidney exchange task is in the sentence \u201cWe applied the processed dataset to the model and obtained an accuracy of 60% for matching prediction\u201d.  \n    - The remainder of Section 6 describes an application of the point process model to the same problem as a comparison with LFGP.  The explanation of this implementation seems lengthy, and could be relegated to an Appendix.\n    - In contrast, the comparison between the point process model and LFGP is isolated to a single paragraph, namely lines 506-516.  Since the performance of the point process model is reported as a ROC curve, and the performance of LFGP is reported as a single accuracy number (60%), this comparison is confusing and inconclusive.\n- I would expect to see significantly more results in a quantitative sense (e.g., figures, performance metrics that are the same for the proposed model and the comparison model) to support the claims made in the abstract and introduction. \n- It seems that [Xu et al., 2023 (10.1080/01621459.2023.2178925)] use the multi-centroid grouping penalty as part of a two-stage model for multi-categorical crowdsourcing in the context of a platform such as Amazon MTurk, where the first stage is to fit the observed labels with a latent factor model, and the second stage is to identify high-quality workers and to make predictions.  It is unclear to me how much of the current work is a new contribution with respect to this paper."

                "value": "- I had to read Section 2 a couple times to understand it \u2014 in paragraph 4, where the paper introduces $\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$, it may be worth adding more detail to clarify what the labels mean in this application, and how to interpret them.\n- The flow of the description in Section 3, Stage 2 (dynamic matching) could be improved \u2014 e.g., after the first paragraph, it would be nice to understand the different workers that must be considered and why they are different.  Introducing notation here may be useful to better contextualize the details that follow.\n- The figures in Section 6 are hard to read.   The legends/labels should be significantly larger.\n- If I understand the paper correctly, $C$ and $D$ (the number of job and worker clusters) are hyperparameters of your framework.  It would be interesting to understand what happens in your clustering approach as this hyperparameter varies -- i.e., how well does the matching perform if $C$ and $D$ do not reflect some ground truth?\n- How is the dynamic matching affected if a new worker arrives, i.e., one with no historical record?  I believe it would be worth spending a few words in the text to discuss this case and how it would be handled by the proposed approach.\n- How well does the latent factor model handle distribution shift?  E.g., if the jobs/workers in the second state (matching stage) don\u2019t resemble the workers in the first stage?  The introduction suggests that there may be a \u201clifelong learning\u201d component to your model that continually updates these latent factors, but I do not see any corresponding discussion in the evaluation.\n- Please detail this paper's contributions with respect to [Xu et al., 2023 (10.1080/01621459.2023.2178925)]."

The statistics of the kidney exchange dataset is missing in the paper. Real-world platforms (e.g., gig economy platforms, online job recommender systems) would require handling significantly more types of jobs and workers. Without evidence of scalability tests with larger worker-job type spaces, it\u2019s uncertain if the model can handle the complexity of diverse real-world data effectively, particularly as computation time could increase exponentially with more latent factors.\n\n2. [Lack of comprehensive comparison]: In Section 6.3, the authors describe the point process model as an alternative but do not provide direct performance comparisons such as AUC, accuracy, or computational efficiency on the same kidney dataset. Additionally, there is limited analysis on how each model performs with temporal data, given that point process models are often preferred for event-driven, time-sensitive scenarios.\n\n3. [Data noise and imbalance]: The model assumes labeled data for training latent factors and matching, but in practical applications, data is often noisy or imbalanced, as seen in fields like crowdsourcing and organ donation w\nhere certain worker types or job types (e.g., rare blood types in kidney exchanges) are underrepresented.
