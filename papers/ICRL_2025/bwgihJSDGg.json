    "title": "Exploiting Task Relationships for Continual Learning with Transferability-aware Task Embedding",
    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) has been a crucial topic in contemporary deep neural network usages, where catastrophic forgetting (CF) can impede a model's ability to progressively acquire knowledge, leading to critical training inefficiency and constraint in the improvement of model's overall capacity. Existing CL strategies mostly mitigate CF either by regularizing model weights and outputs during finetuning or by distinguishing task-specific and task-sharing model components to adapt the training process accordingly. Yet despite their effectiveness, these previous explorations are mainly limited to elements of task models, while we speculate a deeper exploitation of interrelationship among tasks can provide more enhancement for CL. Therefore, to better capture and utilize the task relations,  we propose a transferability task embedding guided hypernet for continual learning. By introducing the information theoretical transferability based task embedding named H-embedding and incorporating it in a hypernetwork, we establish an online framework capable of capturing the statistical relations among the CL tasks and leveraging these knowledge for deriving task-conditioned model weights. The framework is also characterized by notable practicality, in that it only requires storing a low dimensional task embedding for each task, and can be efficiently trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive evaluations and experimental analyses on datasets including Permuted MNIST, Cifar10/100 and ImageNet-R showcase that our framework performs prominently compared to various baseline methods, as well as displays great potential in obtaining intrinsic task relationships.",

Will it degrade after a long run? Will it be hard to tune the hypernetwork? I belive it is crucial to present that the proposed methods is robust enough.\n3. Although the embedding is small, will training time linearly increase with the number of previous tasks?\n4. The use of the hypernet to generate weights for each task is not entirely concise, in my opinion. How long does it take to generate weights during inference? What if the incoming task switches frequently? I would like to know the inference speed when dealing with an extreme case where tasks switch with each iteration compared to a standard model."

It is crucial to consider both backward and forward transfer in evaluating continual learning. Through its experimental setup, the paper demonstrates that H-embedding effectively promotes forward knowledge transfer.\n3. The proposed method is efficient: as the task sequence lengthens, the computational and storage costs remain relatively stable, which adds value for real-world applications."

The selected datasets are not diverse enough; the accuracy on PermutedMNIST is nearing saturation, and CIFAR-10/100 are relatively low in difficulty. The authors should consider more varied datasets, such as Split DomainNet, to strengthen the persuasiveness of the results.\n3. The core contribution of this work mainly involves adding constraints to the task embedding learning process, which does not significantly diverge from the vanilla hypernetwork approach. Additionally, the performance improvement over the original hypernetwork is not very pronounced.\n4. The experiments lack results on more advanced model architectures, such as ViT, and comparisons with continual learning methods based on pretrained models.\n5.
