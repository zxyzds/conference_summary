    "title": "CarbonSense: A Multimodal Dataset and Baseline for Carbon Flux Modelling",
    "abstract": "Terrestrial carbon fluxes provide vital information about our biosphere's health and its capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO$_2$\n emissions. The importance of predicting carbon fluxes has led to the emerging field of data-driven carbon flux modelling (DDCFM), which uses statistical techniques to predict carbon fluxes from biophysical data. However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain. By providing these resources, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for other deep learning researchers to develop new models and drive new advances in carbon flux modelling.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a standardized dataset called CarbonSense, which is a dataset compiled from various sources. The compilation steps include fusing the data together on the same hourly scale, extracting relevant features, and doing min max normalization. Along with the dataset, the paper also proposes a data driven model based on Perceiver called EcoPerceiver. This proposed model uses transformer architecture to cross attend all input features. The paper also implemented a SOTA approach baseline and compared its performance on the proposed dataset with EcoPerceiver."

Domain-relevant evaluation metrics of RMSE and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Modelling Efficiency) are reported for each model and broken down by ecosystem type, with statistical tests of significance of the differences in performance. EcoPerceiver significantly outperforms the XGBoost model, indicating there is room for improvement on the benchmark relative to the previous SOTA with more sophisticated/tailored ML approaches."
