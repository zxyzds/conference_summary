    "title": "Multi-Label Node Classification with Label Influence Propagation",
    "abstract": "Graphs are a complex and versatile data structure used across various domains, with possibly multi-label nodes playing a particularly crucial role. \nExamples include proteins in PPI networks with multiple functions and users in social or e-commerce networks exhibiting diverse interests. \nTackling multi-label node classification (MLNC) on graphs has led to the development of various approaches. Some methods leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit label co-occurrence correlations, while others incorporate label embeddings to capture label proximity. However, these approaches fail to account for the intricate influences between labels in non-Euclidean graph data.\nTo address this issue, we decompose the message passing process in GNNs into two operations: propagation and transformation. \nWe then conduct a comprehensive analysis and quantification of the influence correlations between labels in each operation. \nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel model, Label Influence Propagation (LIP). \nSpecifically, we construct a label influence graph based on the integrated label correlations. \nThen, we propagate high-order influences through this graph, dynamically adjusting the learning process by amplifying labels with positive contributions and mitigating those with negative influence.\nFinally, our framework is evaluated on comprehensive benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming SOTA methods across various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness on MLNC tasks.",

It is better to give some hyperparameter analysis about the model, such as \\alpha, \\beta. It is suggested to plot the results showing how performance varies with these parameters and report the chosen values.\n3. How does the number of label categories k affect the model? It is recommended to study the effect of the performance.\n4. It is highly recommended to give some examples, i.e., the visualization of the positive and negative influence of different labels in the case studies, showing how certain labels positively or negatively influence others and how this affects the model's predictions.\n5. It is recommended to give other backbones, such as the most commonly used GIN, to show the effectiveness of the model.\n6. It is better to check the label of the axis in the figure. i.e., fig 4c.

Actually, decoupled GNNs\\[1,2,3,4,5] have been studied in past a few years. Although the authors are inspired by the theoretical analysis to decouple the propagation module and feature transformation, the previous efforts in decoupled GNNs should be discussed. I have noticed the authors cite APPNP \\[1], one of the representative decoupled GNNs, in Line 263. Here, I suggest the authors open a new subsection in Related Work to comprehensively review recent decoupled GNNs.\n2.  As a plug-and-play, I suggest the authors try more advanced GNNs as backbones for ablation study, such as advanced decoupled GNNs\\[1,3].\n3.  Based on Figure 4(b), I suggest the authors conduct ablation on all other datasets to comprehensively validate the contribution of each module.\n4.  The author claim the efficiency of the proposed method via the time complexity analysis. Maybe the authors can report the computational cost of each methods, including training time cost and GPU memory cost, to strength this contribution.\n\n\n\n[1] Predict then propagate: Graph neural networks meet personalized pagerank, ICLR 2019\n\n[2] On the\u00a0equivalence of decoupled\u00a0graph convolution network and label propagation, WWW 2021\n\n[3] Adaptive universal generalized pagerank graph neural network, ICLR 2021\n\n[4] Towards deeper graph neural networks, KDD 2020\n\n[5] Neighborhood Convolutional Graph Neural Network, KBS 2024"

For instance:\n- The theoretical justification in Section 4.2 and Appendix A needs more clarity. While the authors assert that the graph structure is a key driver of label influence during propagation, they do not fully clarify how the feature influence $I(i,j)$ and PPR are connected to the proposed label influence metric in the propagation operation. I can infer that positive and negative influences in PPR and feature influence metrics correspond to Equations 6 and 5, respectively, but this connection should be made explicit.\n- Additionally, the augmented form of $\\text{\\textbf A}$ is not clearly defined. Is it a multi-hop adjacency matrix?\n\n**W3.** What are the limitations of the proposed method? The authors didn't include a discussion on the potential limitations of the proposed method.\n\nIf the above concerns and subsequent questions are addressed, I'm willing to raise my score."

While benchmark datasets are commonly used in a transductive manner, it would be straightforward to modify these datasets for the inductive setting by masking nodes and their corresponding edges in different splits. The authors should consider evaluating LIP under such conditions to verify the practical relevance."
