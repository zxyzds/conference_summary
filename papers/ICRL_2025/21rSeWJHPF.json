    "title": "Balanced Ranking with Relative Centrality: A multi-core periphery perspective",
    "abstract": "Ranking of vertices in a graph for different objectives is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer science. It is known that traditional ranking algorithms can generate unbalanced ranking when the graph has underlying communities, resulting in loss of information, polarised opinions, and reduced diversity (Celis, Straszak \\& Vishnoi [ICALP 2018]).\n\nIn this paper, we focus on *unsupervised ranking* on graphs and observe that popular centrality measure based ranking algorithms such as PageRank may often generate unbalanced ranking here as well. We address this issue by coining a new approach, which we term *relative centrality*. Our approach is based on an iterative graph-dependent local normalization of the centrality score, which promotes balancedness while maintaining the validity of the ranking.\n\nWe further quantify reasons behind this unbalancedness of centrality measures on a novel structure that we propose is called multi-core-periphery with communities (MCPC). We also provide theoretical and extensive simulation support for our approach towards resolving the unbalancedness in MCPC.\n\nFinally, we consider graph embeddings of $11$ single-cell datasets. We observe that top-ranked as per existing centrality measures are better separable into the ground truth communities. However, due to the unbalanced ranking, the top nodes often do not contain points from some communities. Here, our relative-centrality-based approach generates a ranking that provides a similar improvement in clusterability while providing significantly higher balancedness.",

They propose \"relative centrality\" and develop a ranking algorithm that produces more balanced results than common centrality methods.

The paper briefly addresses the computational complexity of M-Rank for k-regular directed graphs in Section 3.2, but lacks analysis for other approaches, such as N2-Rank and RN-Rank. Providing additional clarification or a more comprehensive complexity analysis, especially for larger or irregular graphs, would enhance the paper's practical relevance for large-scale network applications.\n\n4. Although the authors tested their method on 11 diverse single-cell datasets, these datasets are relatively small\u2014only the TM dataset reaches 54K data points, with others below 16K. The superior results on Onion approach on the TM dataset in Table 2 raise questions about the scalability of the MCPC method on larger datasets. Besides, the PR for Onion is higher (.98) than RN-Rank (.87), yet RN-Rank is incorrectly highlighted in bold, which should be corrected. Evaluating the method on more larger datasets (e.g., millions of data points) could strengthen the paper\u2019s contribution.\n\n5. While the PR scores are high for RN-Rank and N2-Rank, the Purity metric is consistently lower than traditional centrality measures across most datasets in Table 2. The paper would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of this trade-off between Preservation Ratio and Purity, including potential ways to improve Purity scores while maintaining a high Preservation Ratio."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. I am not sure if this work is interesting to the ICLR community. This paper deals with unsupervised ranking, which can be regarded as unsupervised learning, but it may not fall into the scope of \"representation learning,\" which is \"generally referred to as deep learning\" as indicated on the official website of ICLR 2025. This paper may be more suitable for some venues on data mining or network science, for example.\n2. The theoretical analysis seems limited and not supportive for the balancedness of the proposed methods. The analysis relies on several simplifications: for example, the number of underlying communities is $2$, the size of all the cores and peripheries are the same, and $t=1$ in Theorem 3.6. The authors do claim that the analysis can be extended, but do not provide further explanations. On the other hand, although Theorem 3.6 and Lemma A.7 verify that the relative centrality scores of core vertices are close to $1$ and larger than those of periphery vertices, this does not imply that the induced ranking is balanced, since the scores in one community may be all larger than those in other communities.\n3. The paper is messy and needs significant improvement in presentation and layout. First, there lacks a detailed section on related work, making it hard to judge the contribution of this paper and its relevance to the ICLR community. Although Section 2.1 discusses some related work, it is brief and only concerns part of the contributions of the paper. Second, the text for the proposed assumption, methods, and analysis are not structured nicely, which is somewhat confusing. In particular, the order of the main text is not consistent with the contributions outlined in Section 1.1. Finally, there are numerous writing issues that affect the readability of the paper, as listed below.\n4. Some background concepts are not explained clearly. For example, the meaning of the single-cell data, the metrics of NMI and purity, and the \"onion\" baseline are not introduced clearly enough.\n5. The experiments only focus on single-cell datasets, which is limited. More experiments on other types of networks (e.g., social networks) are expected, and the number of tested single-cell datasets can be reduced.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1. Most (if not all) citations in this paper should use `\\citep{}` instead of `\\cite{}`, so that the author names are placed in the parentheses. Also, the authors should cite the published version instead of the arXiv version of some papers.\n2. Line 163: \"community structure\" -> \"core-periphery structure\".\n3. Line 287: here the notation $k$ is ambiguous since it has a different meaning in Line 286.\n4. Line 352: \"$N_{G}(v_{j})$\" -> \"$N_{G}(v_{i})$\". Also, here the term \"neighborhood\" should be specified as \"in-neighborhood\" or \"out-neighborhood\".\n5. Line 762: \"upper bounded\" -> \"lower bounded\".\n6. There are some grammatical issues or typos:\n\t1. Lines 22-23;\n\t2. Line 74: \"for e.g.,\" -> \"e.g.,\";\n\t3. Line 130: \"behind of\" -> \"behind\";\n\t4. Line 180 and other occurrences: \"w.r.t\" -> \"w.r.t.\";\n\t5. Line 264: remove \"is defined\";\n\t6. Lines 419 and 1012: remove repetition of \"look at\";\n\t7. Line 463: remove \"to\";\n\t8. Lines 75 and 270: add space before left parentheses;\n\t9. Lines 192-193: the parentheses are not matched;\n\t10. the hyphens in compound words should be used correctly and consistently. For example, it should be \"centrality-measure-based\" in Line 17 and \"Core-Periphery structure\" in the caption of Figure 2(b).\n7. I recommend to beautify the layout of the paper:\n\t1. the captions of Figure 4 are hard to read;\n\t2. the annotation in Lines 352-353 are separated across lines;\n\t3. Table 1 and Figure 5 are placed weirdly;\n\t4. there should be punctuations around multiline math expressions;\n\t5. math expressions are not aligned nicely, and the ones at the top of page 15 are aligned terribly;\n\t6. the font of notations in math expressions is inconsistent in many places (e.g., $k$, $\\mathrm{deg}(\\cdot)$, and $o(\\cdot)$ in Lines 849-856);\n\t7. the text font changes in Lines 1332-1346."
