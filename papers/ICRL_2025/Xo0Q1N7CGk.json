    "title": "An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent\u2019s position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.",

                "value": "The paper studies the conformal isometry hypothesis for grid cells. They studied this in a minimal setting, in the isolation of modeling place cells. They show analysis that the hypothesis underlies the hexagonal periodic patterns that the grid cells exhibit. Moreover, they mathematically show that the hexagon patterns are minimal deviations from the local conformal isometry, which can emerge by minimizing the discussed loss function. They perform topological analysis and show the similarities of the arose patterns with their mathematical model to the neural data."

Moreover, the paper discusses that their assumptions are less strict than prior works. These comparisons should be included in-depth in the main paper (in this version, only the intro discusses). Moreover, the first half of the paper is organized well; however, the theoretical analysis can be organized better. I recommend combining Sections 4 and 5.\n\n\nI have comments about additional experiments and discussions that can help to improve the paper (see my questions).\n\n\nminor \n\n- Some sentences in the abstract are exactly repeated in the intro.

For example, can the authors conduct an ablation study where an assumption is violated or added, resulting in no longer optimal hexagons? This study may bring much value. For example, the authors emphasize the importance of the normalization step, which plays a crucial role in finding the correlation between terms in the theoretical analysis. Possible to see numerical analysis in the absence of such constraint?\n\n- It was reported briefly how this work differs from Gao et al. 's. (2021) and Xu et al. (2022) on their study on conformal isometry, please discuss the importance of the difference. Why the proposed approach of only modeling the grid cells is better than the previously studied combined model?\n\n- Could the authors please explain the choice of 1.25 and 3 in the experiment design in Section 3.3.\n\n- Three models are chosen, showing that the grid pattern still emerges. Can the authors clarify if their results are fully independent of the choice of such models?\n\n- More clarifications are needed for Figure 2. How exactly are Figure 2b(ii) and (iii) constructed?\n\n- Is the finding on the proportion of the scale of patterns and the s parameter unique and new from this paper?\n\n- What is the impact of \\lambda on the presented analysis and results?"

I particularly like the ablation experiments in Fig 3e-h.\n\n* The core theoretical insight (which I view as being shown in sections 4.1) is quite interesting.

What are the potential benefits of this coding scheme? Absent any functional benefit, it is hard to interpret the significance of these results. Is it just a coincidence that this model gives the same grid coding scheme as real networks? Or is there a deeper reason why biological and artificial networks will converge upon a conformal map of space?\n\n* Sections 4.2 - 4.4 are confusing. Because there are three sections, it feels as though the authors are trying to list three different results, but I think all three of these sections are really just supporting the same result (i.e. that hexagonal flat torus results in minimal deviation from local isometry). I suggest that the authors merge these three subsections into one. Furthermore, it would be easier to read if the main result were formally presented as a proposition and, potentially, if the result in section 4.3 were formally presented as a lemma. Overall, I would suggest re-writing this portion of the paper to make the motivation more clear.\n\n* It would be useful to investigate how important assumption 3 (normalization) is to the results. Figure 3f shows that the hexagonal grids do not form when normalization is removed entirely. Real biological networks are likely normalized imperfectly. Is imperfect normalization sufficient to get hexagonal grids? That is, what if $1 - \\epsilon \\leq \\Vert \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}) \\Vert \\leq 1 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$? How big can $\\epsilon$ get before the grids fail to form?\n\n* There is a question about whether ICLR is the optimal venue for this kind of work, which I think will be primarily interesting to experimental and theoretical neuroscientists. I think this work will have little to no cross-over appeal to machine learning or artificial intelligence communities."

While the authors made it clear why a hexagonal torus is local isotropic, it was not clear to me when/if the authors ever showed it was optimal because it \"achieve the least deviation from local flatness because it distributes the extrinsic curvature evenly over all directions\" (Sec. 4.4). Providing more discussion on this (and explaining why other flat tori do not distribute extrinsic curvature evenly) would make their point of optimality more clear. \n\n2. While it was interesting to see that the framework developed by the authors could be expanded to include the generation of multiple modules (that were organized approximately $\\sqrt(2)$ apart in grid spacing), how exactly the multiple modules tied in to the idea of conformal isometry was lost for me. In an otherwise well structured paper, it felt a little like it was tacked on at the end and the thread was lost. Providing more discussion on how having multiple modules, in addition to the need to decode place responses, affects the kinds of representations that lead to conformal isometry, would be helpful. \n\nMINOR POINTS: \n\n1. What is meant by \"$\\Delta x$ is constrained to be smaller than 3 grids?\" By this do you mean 3 grids of the underlying space discretization? Maybe using a different word would be helpful to keep the reader from confusing this with grid cells. \n\n2. What is valid rate that is reported in Table 1? \n\n3. The real neural data analyzed by the authors satisfies conformal isometry (Fig. 5 - up to $||\\Delta x|| = 0.2$) for a much larger scale than the grid cells generated by the authors' models (Fig. 4 - up to $||\\Delta x|| = 0.08$). Why do the authors think this is? Could this be due to the Gardner et al. data having variability in grid properties (Redman et al., 2024) not present in the authors' model?\n\n4. Which module from the Garnder et al. data set was analyzed? If I remember correctly, none of the modules had 93 grid cells. Did the authors perform some screening on which grid cells to include?"
