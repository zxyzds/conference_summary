    "title": "COSTAR: Dynamic Safety Constraints Adaptation in Safe Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) have focused on developing agents that maximize rewards while satisfying predefined safety constraints. However, the challenge of learning policies capable of generalizing to dynamic safety requirements has rarely been explored. To this end, we propose a novel COntrastive Safe TAsk Representation (COSTAR) framework for safe RL, which can boost existing algorithm's generalization to dynamic safety constraints, including variable cost functions and safety thresholds.In COSTAR, we employ a Safe Task Encoder to extract safety-specific representations from trajectory contexts, effectively distinguishing between various safety constraints with contrastive learning. It is noteworthy that our framework can integrate with existing safe RL algorithms and possesses zero-shot adaptation capability to varying safety constraints during deployment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our COSTAR framework consistently achieves high rewards while maintaining low costs, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.",

The comparison with existing works are very limited. For example, MESA [1] and LUSR [2] are the very similar methods with slightly different target scenario. MESA is an offline meta safe RL for falut tolerance for few-shot adaptation, and LUSR is an econder based RL adaptation method for generalized state representation.\n2. The proposed method seems a simple combination of encoder, constrative learning, and augmented input for policy.\n3. One of the main result, figure 4 has no meaningful contribution. The safe velocity environment has the property that the the cost is given when the current velocity is higher than the thresold, and the reward becomes higher when the value of velocity for the foward direction is higher. To show more meaningful result, the authors should have provided the result of the oracle for each single threshold to validate the proposed method succesfully works with adapting the varying safety threshold.\n4. The reported environments covers a  small subset of safety-gymnasium enviornments compared to current safe RL papers. It is better to conduct more experiments with unconvered environments to validate the proposed method.\n\n\n[1] Luo, Michael, et al. \"Mesa: Offline meta-rl for safe adaptation and fault tolerance.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.03575 (2021).\n\n[2] Xing, Jinwei, et al. \"Domain adaptation in reinforcement learning via latent unified state representation.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Could the authors clarify if both the cost functions and thresholds are time-varying, or if only the cost functions are intended to vary over time?\n2. The abstract mentions that COSTAR demonstrates robust generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks (lines 23-24). However, during meta-testing, the trained policy is applied to tasks sampled from the same distribution as in meta-training (lines 138-141). Could the authors clarify what is meant by OOD tasks in this context?\n3. In Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, why is the sampled set $\\mathcal{M}^c$ finite? In general, it is more reasonable to assume this to be infinite, considering the number of cost functions and safety thresholds and their combinations. If the $\\mathcal{M}^c$ is indeed finite, how can COSTAR generalize to OOD tasks, i.e., a new $M^c \\notin \\mathcal{M}^c$ as the learned representation may not capture the new task? What are the assumptions behind evaluation and training tasks?\n4. As shown in Algorithm 1, at each iteration, a CMDP is sampled from a distribution $\\mathcal{M}^c$. How is this distribution defined? How efficient is COSTAR if |$\\mathcal{M}^c$| is large or infinite? \n5. According to lines 311-315, COSTAR performs constraint minimization for \u201cone of the violated constraints\u201d to enforce safety. Could the authors clarify how this update rule ensures overall constraint satisfaction, as addressing a single constraint may not satisfy others, particularly if constraints are conflicting with each other [1]? \\\n[1] https://proceedings.mlr.press/v164/huang22a/huang22a.pdf\n6. Regarding the evaluation in Section 4: a) Why are the original environments modified to use fixed obstacle layouts? Randomly sampling the layout at certain time-steps could provide a more rigorous test and a fixed layout could oversimplify the evaluation. b) Could the authors provide more detailed results for Figure 3? It appears that removing certain components of COSTAR does not lead to constraint violations.; c) In Figure 4, COSTAR struggles to maintain safety when the safety threshold is lower than the thresholds used in training (e.g., threshold = 10). Could the authors include additional results for thresholds below the training levels to clarify the method's behavior under stricter safety conditions? d) According to Equation (6), COSTAR should handle multiple constraints simultaneously. Why is it evaluated in environments with only one constraint, which may limit its demonstrated potential? e) The evaluation covers only four environments in total. Could the authors test the method in a wider range of environments with more diverse cost functions and safety thresholds to better showcase COSTAR\u2019s performance?"
