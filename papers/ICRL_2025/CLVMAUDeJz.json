    "title": "Distributed Constrained Optimal  Consensus  Under a Directed Graph",
    "abstract": "In  this paper, the distributed  constrained optimal consensus problem of multi-agent systems under a directed graph  is investigated. We propose two projection-based distributed constrained optimal consensus algorithms: one addressing set constraints and the other tailored for general constraints. Only the relative state is exchanged among agents in these two algorithms. In the stability analysis of case with set constraints, we transform the distributed  optimization problem  into a constrained leaderless consensus problem by adopting a sliding mode approach. Building on this foundational transformation, we further develop a projection-based  distributed constrained optimal consensus algorithm to  address  general constraints. It is shown that the proposed algorithm achieves an ergodic convergence rate of  $O(\\frac{1}{k})$  with respect to the first-order optimality residuals. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.",

First, what is the DSP /DPS algorithm? The two names of the algorithm both appear in the paper while the full name is missing and it is not clear what is the difference of the DSP/DPS(?) algorithm and the proposed method except for the learning rate. Second, a number of optimization methods with constraints have been reviewed in the Introduction part, however, it is not clear why they are not used as benchmarks in the experiments. \n3. The writing needs improvement. Many equations have space issues and missing some sentences missing punctuation. For example, Line 403 \"Stability Analysis: In this part, we have the following assumption\" should be \"Stability Analysis: In this part, we have the following assumption.\", line 270 \"equation (7)\" should be \"Equation (7)\". Some symbols are not defined such as $T$ and $\\alpha_i$ when they are used in the equations."

For example, Assumption 2.1 states that the considered graph should be strongly connected and balanced, but it is not explained what is the motivation behind this assumption, nor the terms are clearly defined. Another example is the content of Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 which both consist of several mathematical statements and results placed one after the other without really linking them. A third example would be equation (18) and the sentence surrounding it, where it is not clear what information should the reader note about this statement.\n-\t**Proposed algorithms given without context:** Similar to the previous point, the two algorithms proposed in the paper are given without context, lacking a justification of the different terms in (5), (12), and (13). Without providing these, it is very difficult for the reader to understand the originality, novelty, and intuition behind the proposed methods. Every term of these equations should be explained and the novel parts should be emphasized. Currently, it is not clear what parts of the proposed algorithms are new and which ones are parts of existing methods. Additionally, some terms in the proposed algorithms are not defined, for example, $T$ and $\\alpha$ are not mentioned before (5).\n-\t**The motivation behind the proposed approaches is limited:** In Section 1.1, potential alternative approaches existing in the literature are presented. For the set-constrained case, it is stated in the paper that: \n\u201cOne drawback of utilizing diminishing step sizes is a slower convergence rate. Therefore, it is desired to design a projection based algorithm with constant step-sizes.\u201d\nAs for the general constraints, the authors mention:\n\u201cBesides the difficulties of projection operation, the existence of nonlinear inequality constraints has introduced significant complexities into stability analysis\u2026\u201d\nThese two statements are, in my opinion, not very clear motivations for proposing alternative solutions. *For the former case, is a diminishing step-size that significant of a drawback, are there other studies on this? Additionally, what other drawbacks do the existing algorithms have, and are they also solved by the proposed approach? For the latter case, what type of complexities have been introduced, are they just more complex to analyze or does a stability analysis not exist for those algorithms?*\n-\t**The manuscript requires proofreading:** I will give a few examples. (i) The Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$ of a graph is mentioned and used to make mathematical statements, before defining it in the next paragraph, at the beginning of page 3. (ii) At the beginning of Section 3.1, $f_i(q)$ is mentioned where $q$ has not been defined and is probably meant to be $x$. (iii) The algorithm used for comparison in Section 5 is sometimes referred to as DPS, sometimes as DSP. (iv) In Section 5, it is written that \u201cThe DPS algorithm (6)\u2026\u201d, but equation (6) is an equation about the equilibrium analysis. (v) The legend of Figure 1.b refers to equation (24), which is never mentioned in the main text, and is a seemingly unrelated equation found in the appendix.\n\nAdditionally, I find that **the simulation section can also be developed further**. At least one more optimization problem can be studied. There also seems to be a mistake in the expression of $f_i(x_i)$ in Section 5, as it does not correspond to a quadratic function as mentioned in the text."

Can you provide a rigorous proof of boundedness for $\\gamma_{ik}(k)$ so as to omit Assumption 4.3? If so, does it apply locally (close to optimality) or globally? Alternatively, can you revise your analysis to avoid this assumption? Please also remove or replace the statement about \"continuous experimentation and testing\" in lines 407-408 with a more rigorous justification.\n3. Can you provide a step-size selection rule that is efficiently computable in a distributed manner? In particular:\na) Can you please explicitly describe how equations (30) and (42) can be computed in a distributed manner, if possible?\nb) If not, can you propose an alternative distributed method for step-size selection and analyze its cost?\nc) Can you also please provide clear ranges or guidelines for selecting $\\alpha_i,\\alpha_{v_i},\\alpha_{\\gamma_{ik}}$ in Theorem 4.4?\n4. Can you please \na) provide experiments on a more realistic application problem (such as distributed model predictive control or resource allocation)?\nb) compare with more baseline methods (see 1.above for examples)?\nc) describe a more systematic and distributedly amenable approach for parameter tuning?\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Please add the step-size selection rules and convergence rate in the statements of your main theorems. \n- I suggest writing Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 for the two methods and summarizing the key convergence results in comparison with relevant methods in a table in the main paper. You can compress the background material which is almost 50% of the current paper.
