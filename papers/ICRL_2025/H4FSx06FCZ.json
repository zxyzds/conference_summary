    "title": "SecureGS: Boosting the Security and Fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting Steganography",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a premier method for 3D representation due to its real-time rendering and high-quality outputs, underscoring the critical need to protect the copyright and privacy of 3D assets. Traditional NeRF steganography methods fail to address the explicit nature of 3DGS since its point cloud files are publicly accessible. Existing GS steganography solutions mitigate some issues but still struggle with reduced rendering fidelity, increased computational demands, and security flaws, especially in the security of the geometric structure of the visualized point cloud. To address these challenges, we propose a SecureGS, a secure and efficient 3DGS steganography framework inspired by Scaffold-GS's anchor point design and neural decoding. SecureGS utilizes a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism to embed offsets, scales, rotations, and RGB attributes of the hidden 3D Gaussian points within anchor point features, retrievable only by authorized users through privacy-preserving neural networks. To further enhance security, we propose a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy that adaptively locates optimal hiding regions without exposing hidden information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecureGS significantly surpasses existing GS steganography methods in rendering fidelity, speed, and security, effectively concealing and accurately extracting 3D objects, images, and bits within original 3D scenes.",

Be specific, avoid generic remarks. For example, if you believe the contribution lacks novelty, provide references and an explanation as evidence; if you believe experiments are insufficient, explain why and exactly what is missing, etc.\n\n1: SECUREGS and GS-Hider are notably similar, including their formulas, descriptions, and flowcharts. This resemblance suggests that the research content leans more towards optimizing the memory efficiency of GS-Hider rather than introducing substantial advancements. Consequently, the innovative aspects of this work appear insufficient to establish a distinct contribution to the field of 3DGS security.\n\n2: In terms of robustness verification, this paper fails to address the effectiveness of SecureGS against adversarial attacks and lacks experimental results for hiding scenes within scenes. The framework's ability to withstand pruning does not appear to be robust. Furthermore, the source code for the baseline scheme (GS-Hider) has not been made publicly available, and the paper does not provide detailed descriptions of the relevant parameter settings. As a result, the experimental findings lack credibility and may not be convincing to the reader.\n\n3: In terms of memory optimization, many existing memory optimization strategies use less than 20% of the memory of the original 3DGS, while SecureGS still retains a large number of redundant Gaussian points, which may hinder its ability to achieve real-time rendering in future 3DGS applications. This limitation poses a challenge for practical applications, especially in scenarios that require fast processing and high efficiency.\n\n4: It is better to describe the current research status more systematically. The figures in your paper are a bit blurry. Please consider replacing them with clearer ones."

The authors claimed that the proposed method addresses the issue of rendering quality existing previous methods. However, the experimental results show that the average improvement is only 1.16 dB. In my experience, such slight changes in PSNR values \u200b\u200busually result in only negligible subjective differences. Additionally, the $PSNR_o$ values in Table 2 and 4 are relatively low (below 30 dB), so I think the high-fidelity restoration of hidden objects comes at the expense of the quality of the original scene restoration. This further raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison in Table 1 and 5, because the author did not show the results of $PSNR_0$."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. SecureGS essentially combines elements of GS-Hider and Scaffold-GS, with limited originality. The core method of SecureGS is to create separate anchor points for the hidden objects and the original scene, which is quite similar to GS-Hider\u2019s approach of creating Gaussian points for both separately\u2014only differing in terms of abstraction level, from points to anchors. While SecureGS introduces a region-aware anchor growth and pruning strategy, these improvements are mostly about implementation details rather than any fundamental innovation. Moreover, the anchor growth and pruning strategies resemble those seen in previous 3D scene optimization work, which makes it hard to classify them as novel contributions. Consequently, the theoretical advancement of SecureGS compared to GS-Hider and Scaffold-GS is not adequately demonstrated, and the overall method feels more like an incremental combination of existing techniques rather than a breakthrough, resulting in relatively weak innovation and technical contributions.\n\n2. The motivation for using Scaffold-GS as the foundational framework is insufficiently explained. Although the paper mentions that using anchor points to generate Gaussian points helps keep their attributes and positions secure since they do not need to be directly stored, these advantages are primarily about rendering efficiency and scalability, rather than any inherent suitability for steganography or encryption tasks. Therefore, directly equating the properties of Scaffold-GS with the encryption encoder-decoder in steganography feels like a logical leap without rigorous backing. The authors need to clarify how Scaffold-GS specifically offers unique advantages for the steganography task and strengthen the rationale for this choice.\n\n3. The ablation studies are too simplistic and fail to convincingly demonstrate SecureGS's unique contributions. Despite claims of outperforming other methods in terms of visual quality (such as PSNR) and file size, the reasons for these improvements are insufficiently explained. As shown in Table 1, much of the performance gain could simply be attributed to the foundation provided by Scaffold-GS, rather than any innovations introduced in SecureGS. Since Scaffold-GS is an upgraded version of Gaussian Splatting, which inherently improves rendering quality and efficiency, directly comparing SecureGS (based on Scaffold-GS) to GS-Hider (based on 3DGS) is insufficient to prove the superiority of the proposed method. The authors need more comprehensive ablation studies to clarify the independent contributions of each new module to ensure that the observed improvements come from their own innovations rather than from Scaffold-GS's inherent advantages. Otherwise, it is difficult to consider these enhancements as unique contributions of SecureGS.\n\n4. SecureGS heavily relies on the Scaffold-GS framework, particularly in the way anchor generation and density optimization are integrated. This deep coupling makes SecureGS less flexible and not readily applicable to other Gaussian splatting models. \n\n5. The effectiveness of the region-aware anchor growth and pruning strategy lacks systematic theoretical support. There is no formal proof or analysis provided to demonstrate whether this strategy is optimal for steganography tasks. Section 3.4's gradient handling and anchor splitting thresholds are mostly based on empirical choices rather than rigorous theoretical derivation. Without a theoretical foundation, the robustness and generalizability of these strategies across different scenes are uncertain, which reduces the reliability and stability of the proposed method in real-world applications.\n\n6. The robustness experiments in SecureGS are insufficient, as they only consider the impact of random anchor pruning, neglecting other significant attack scenarios that could affect the security of steganography. Robustness is critical in evaluating steganographic methods, yet SecureGS lacks tests on important attacks such as point cloud denoising, random point deletion or addition, and geometric transformations. These factors are as crucial as visual quality in the domain of steganography and watermarking, and without proper evaluation of these aspects, the practical security of SecureGS remains questionable.\n\n7. In Table 1, SecureGS shows a significant increase in PSNR compared to Scaffold-GS, which the authors attribute to increased anchor density and the decoupling strategy. However, it seems questionable that the PSNR for the original scene is higher despite SecureGS embedding additional hidden information. Scaffold-GS has no additional hidden data and can focus solely on rendering the scene, while SecureGS introduces extra information that could potentially interfere with the fidelity of the original scene. There is no sufficient core optimization provided in the paper to justify this improvement. This effect seems more likely due to increased anchor density and computational resources rather than a genuine methodological advancement in balancing steganography with scene fidelity. More theoretical analysis or experimental validation is recommended to clarify this observation, ensuring that the PSNR improvements are due to actual innovation rather than just additional resource allocation."
