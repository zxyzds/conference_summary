    "title": "Knockout: A simple way to handle missing inputs",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models can extract predictive and actionable information from complex inputs. The richer the inputs, the better these models usually perform. However, models that leverage rich inputs (e.g., multi-modality) can be difficult to deploy widely, because some inputs may be missing at inference. Current popular solutions to this problem include marginalization, imputation, and training multiple models. Marginalization can obtain calibrated predictions but it is computationally costly and therefore only feasible for low dimensional inputs. Imputation may result in inaccurate predictions because it employs point estimates for missing variables and does not work well for high dimensional inputs (e.g., images). Training multiple models whereby each model takes different subsets of inputs can work well but requires knowing missing input patterns in advance. Furthermore, training and retaining multiple models can be costly. We propose an efficient way to learn both the conditional distribution using full inputs and the marginal distributions. Our method, Knockout, randomly replaces input features with appropriate placeholder values during training. We provide a theoretical justification of Knockout and show that it can be viewed as an implicit marginalization strategy. We evaluate Knockout in a wide range of simulations and real-world datasets and show that it can offer strong empirical performance.",

Knockout randomly replaces input features with appropriate placeholder values during training. At inference time, using the placeholder value corresponds to marginalization over the missing variables.\n\nThe key contributions are:\n\n1) Theoretical justification showing that Knockout implicitly maximizes the likelihood of a weighted sum of the conditional estimators and all desired marginals in a single model.\n\n2) Analysis and recommendations for choosing appropriate placeholder values for different data types (categorical, continuous, structured).\n\n3) Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (images, tabular data) demonstrating Knockout's effectiveness in handling missing inputs across various scenarios, outperforming common baselines like mean/mode imputation and ensemble methods."

It is unclear how well Knockout would perform in scenarios with limited data or low-capacity models.\n- The comparison against strong baselines trained specifically for certain missingness patterns is missing. In practical scenarios where the missingness patterns are known or limited, such specialized models could potentially outperform Knockout."

While the authors provide recommendations, have you explored techniques to automatically learn or optimize the placeholder values during training?\n- In scenarios with limited training data or low-capacity models, how well does Knockout perform compared to simpler baselines like mean/mode imputation? Are there any modifications or variations of Knockout that could improve its effectiveness in such cases?\n- Have you explored the potential of Knockout to handle distribution shifts in the presence of missingness? For example, if the missingness patterns or distributions change between training and inference, how would Knockout perform compared to other methods?\n- While the paper covers a diverse set of tasks and data modalities, it would be interesting to see Knockout's performance on more complex tasks like language modeling or multimodal learning, where missing modalities could be prevalent."

Compared to existing approaches like marginalization (computationally expensive), imputation (potentially inaccurate for high-dimensional data), or training multiple models (costly and requires prior knowledge of missing patterns), Knockout offers a more efficient and flexible solution. The authors also carefully analyze how to choose appropriate placeholder values for different types of inputs and show how Knockout can handle both complete and incomplete training data under various missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)."

For these types of papers, it is required to have thorough experimental studies and solid comparisons to show the applied contributions. But, I think this paper has lack of comparisons with important baselines or prior works.\n\n* The main missing baseline for comparison is the dropout method. Actually, the comparison between knockout and knockout* shows that most of the advantage comes from random replacement. In fact, since the model has seen more missing data during training, it has become more robust to missingness and performs better on test data. An intuitive baseline is to apply dropout with the same missing rate and compare with knockout. Likewise, it may be possible that by applying the same rate of random missingness and use any other baseline (e.g. mean/media imputation or other methods), their performance also improves. In general, I think the comparisons performed in the paper were not fair since the other methods did not see the same amount of missing values during training\n\n* The paper misses to cite some important related works:\n    * Why not to use zero imputation? correcting sparsity bias in training neural networks\n    * Debiasing Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent\n    * Learning from data with structured missingness\n\n* Further, the paper cites some important papers such as \"Ipsen et al, How to deal with missing data in supervised deep learning\" but does not perform any comparison. I understand this paper proposes a complicated model. But, for an ICLR paper, I think stronger baseslines are expected."
