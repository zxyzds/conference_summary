    "title": "Efficient Time Series Forecasting via Hyper-Complex Models and Frequency Aggregation",
    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a long-standing problem in statistics and machine learning. One of the key challenges is processing sequences with long-range dependencies. To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which partitions the sequence into multiple subsequences and applies a Fourier transform to each separately. Current models do not leverage information that is shared between neighboring windows, despite being highly correlated.  We propose the Frequency Information Aggregation (FIA)-Net, which is based on a novel complex-valued MLP architecture that aggregates adjacent window information in the frequency domain. To further increase the receptive field of the FIA-Net, we treat the set of windows as hyper-complex (HC) valued vectors and employ HC algebra to efficiently combine information from all STFT windows altogether. Using the HC-MLP backbone allows for improved handling of sequences with long-term dependence. Furthermore, due to the nature of HC operations, the HC-MLP uses up to three times fewer parameters than the equivalent standard window aggregation method. We evaluate the FIA-Net on various time-series benchmarks and show that the proposed methodologies outperform existing state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available on \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/research-1803/}.",

                "value": "This paper introduces the FIA-Net method for time series forecasting (TSF) model. FIA-Net leverages the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Window Mixing MLP (WM-MLP) to aggregates information from subsets of STFT windows in the frequency domain. This paper also proposes a Hypercomplex MLP as a substitution of WM-MLP, which expands the receptive field and reduces the number of parameters . FIA-Net requires significantly fewer parameters than traditional methods while achieving comparable performance. A filtering technique, which retains only the top-M frequency components of the STFT windows, helps reduce model size and complexity while maintaining accuracy. The FIA-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency on various time-series benchmarks.\nThe paper includes an ablation study that explores the effect of each components of FIA-Net and compares the performance of the two considered MLP backbones."

Besides, the results of FIA-Net and FreTS are also very close, the reported gap of MSE in many comparisons are only 0.001 or even equal. Therefore, the effectiveness of windows-integrating is questionable.\n\n2. In the last paragraph of section 4.2, it is said that \"HC-MLP aggregates information from the entire set of windows altogether, allowing for a better processing of long-term memory sequences\". However, in the reported results of Table 1 and text contents of section 5.1, \" We can deduce that the HC-MLP is more suitable for shorter-term prediction, while the WM-MLP backbone is more suitable for longer ranges.\" The theoretical analysis contradicts the phenomenon of experimtents.\n\n3. The figure 4 is not easily interpretable, mainly because the symbols of different operations are too similar. The figure is even less expressive than the corresponding equation 3."

The authors use terms interchangeably, such as \"novel complex-valued MLP architecture,\" \"the proposed methodologies,\" and \"a new model for long-term...\" This makes it unclear what the authors are actually proposing.\nIn the abstract, the authors state, \"To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-term Fourier Transform (STFT).\" However, in my view, the use of STFT to transform time series into the frequency domain cannot be considered recent, as numerous studies have applied this approach over the past decade.\nThe manuscript\u2019s title includes \"Efficient time series forecasting,\" yet efficiency was not assessed in the results presented by the authors.\nAdditionally, the motivation for using STFT is not clearly explained. In brief, the Fourier Transform (FT) is a widely recognized technique for identifying signal frequencies, but it does not indicate the specific time at which these frequencies occur. To address this limitation, researchers proposed STFT, which divides the signal into equal-sized windows and applies FT to approximate the timing of each frequency. However, STFT has an inherent trade-off regarding window size selection. Superior results can often be achieved with methods like wavelets, which provide both time and frequency localization. The authors should clarify why they chose STFT over wavelets, considering the extensive body of literature that already uses wavelets for similar tasks, as demonstrated in several published works:\n\n- T.

                "value": "1 - The manuscript must be fully reviewed. Proofreading is strongly recommended to fix grammar errors, such as \"Table 2 show\", \"As As shown\", \"the KKR are given\", \"We the FIA-Net\", \"the HC-MLP is\", \"the STFT is implements\", \"SFM utilize frequency\", and so on. There are several grammar errors. \n2 - Appendices are not available in the manuscript, as cited in several parts of the text.\n3 - All citations are wrong. I suppose the latex command used in the final of all paragraphs is wrong. \n4 - Captions of figures and tables should be better presented. For example, Table 1 should provide details about the evaluation metric, and Figure 5 has no punctuation. These problems are also seen in other parts. \n5 - In the introduction, the authors say \"we show that the FeeqShiftNet improves\", but it is not clearly discussed in the manuscript.\n6 - In the abstract, the authors mention \"a novel complex-valued MLP architecture. Later, they say \"we propose two novel MLP architectures\". Still in the introduction, the authors mention \"we construct the FIA-Net and the WM-MLP backbone\". Besides the grammar errors, there are several inconsistencies. \n7 - In Section 2, the authors say \"Two popular architectures were proposed to improve upon RNNs\". GNNs were mentioned as one of those architectures. Actually, GNN is not an architecture and wasn't proposed to improve RNN.\n8 - Equations in Section 3.1 must be refined. There are errors and wrong notations. For example, X = {x_1, ..., x_t} \\in R^{D x L}; is the length of the time series t or L? Who is D? Is it the TS dimension? Is it necessary to show D, once the authors are working on 1D time series?\n9 - In Equation 1, are the authors using Fast Fourier Transform (N_{FFT})? This is not clear.\n10 - Equation iSTFT was not numbered. In this equation, the variable X is characterized by presenting c and F, but both were not properly defined.\n11 - Is the proposal designed to work on consecutive windows? How many consecutive windows? How was it assessed in terms of long-term dependencies?\n12 - There is a short discussion on model complexity, but no experiment was performed to demonstrate the efficiency.\n13 - On page 5, is the window determined as p?\n14 - Did the authors present information about R-STFT?\n15 - The authors only used MAE and RMSE to assess the results. Why? There are several other metrics that could provide further information. Why weren't they considered?"

                "value": "The paper exhibits several severe weaknesses that considerably undermine its overall contribution. \n\nThe introduction of hyper-complex numbers appears to be an unnecessary complication, lacking both theoretical justification and demonstrated algebraic advantages specific to the task at hand. The authors fail to compare their method against simpler alternatives, such as a straightforward global MLP aggregator of the STFT windows, which could potentially achieve comparable results without the added complexity. Furthermore, while the authors emphasize that the HC-MLP backbone, unlike the WM-MLP, can process the entire sequence (all p windows) and potentially achieve higher performance, the empirical results show that the best performance often comes from the WM-MLP. This discrepancy between the theoretical advantages claimed for the HC-MLP and the actual experimental outcomes further undermines the justification for the more complex HC-MLP approach.\n\nThe literature review and comparison with existing methods are notably incomplete. While some papers, such as the one available at https://arxiv.org/html/2407.21275v1, are cited, the authors do not compare their model against these works. Furthermore, other relevant papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11047v1 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824002669) that utilize temporal correlations between STFT windows have been overlooked, undermining the claimed novelty of the presented method.\n\nThe paper lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation to explain why their methods outperform existing ones. It relies heavily on empirical results without providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms at work. This absence of theoretical grounding limits the generalizability and broader impact of the work. Additionally, the experimental results lack error bars and statistical significance tests, which are crucial for validating the claimed improvements and assessing the robustness of the findings.\n\nThe authors' treatment of their finding that the real part alone might be sufficient for predictions is underdeveloped. This potentially significant insight is not explored thoroughly, missing an opportunity for deeper analysis and possible model simplification. Moreover, this observation seems to contradict the stated need for the hypercomplex formulation, further calling into question the necessity of the proposed approach.\n\nOverall, the paper suffers from numerous grammatical errors, typos, and inconsistencies throughout both the main text and the Appendix, making it challenging to read in some sections. It is strongly recommended that the authors employ a professional proofreading service to enhance the overall quality and clarity of the manuscript, if they plan to resubmit this work somewhere else in the future.\n\nThe following is a partial list of minor comments and typos:\n1.\tAbstract: \"state of the art\" should be \"state-of-the-art\".\n2.\tSection 1, Authors refer to \u201cFeeqShiftNet\u201d when talking about their model. \n3.\tTable 2: the two rows are \u201cFIA-Net\u201d and \u201cOctontionMLP\u201d.
