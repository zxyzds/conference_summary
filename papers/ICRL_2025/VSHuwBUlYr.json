    "title": "Zero-Shot Video Semantic Segmentation based on Pre-Trained Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "We introduce the first zero-shot approach for Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) based on pre-trained diffusion models. A growing research direction attempts to employ diffusion models to perform downstream vision tasks by exploiting their deep understanding of image semantics. Yet, the majority of these approaches have focused on image-related tasks like semantic segmentation, with less emphasis on video tasks such as VSS. Ideally, diffusion-based image semantic segmentation approaches can be applied to videos in a frame-by-frame manner. However, we find their performance on videos to be subpar due to the absence of any modeling of temporal information inherent in the video data. To this end, we tackle this problem and introduce a framework tailored for VSS based on pre-trained image and video diffusion models. We propose building a scene context model based on the diffusion features, where the model is autoregressively updated to adapt to scene changes. This context model predicts per-frame coarse segmentation maps that are temporally consistent. To refine these maps further, we propose a correspondence-based refinement strategy that aggregates predictions temporally, resulting in more confident predictions. Finally, we introduce a masked modulation approach to upsample the coarse maps to a high-quality full resolution. Experiments show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing zero-shot image semantic segmentation approaches on various VSS benchmarks without any training or fine-tuning. Moreover, it rivals supervised VSS approaches on the VSPW dataset despite not being explicitly trained for VSS.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a zero-shot video semantic segmentation (VSS) method based on diffusion models. The method consists of 3 main components: 1. a scene context model that models the classes in a video based on diffusion model decoder features 2. a correspondence algorithm that produces a coarse segmentation map for each frame and 3. an upsampling strategy that applies masking to modulated segmentation masks. The method is implemented using either Stable Diffusion and Stable Video Diffusion as backbones. Experiments are conducted to compare the method's performance to the baselines on 3 VSS datasets. Ablations are carried out to asses the contribution of the 3 components above on a subset of a VSS dataset."

                "value": "1. The label setting and motivation are not clear. In Section 5.1, Evaluation Protocol, it says that the labels from the ground truth of the first frame are used to assign labels to the method's clusters (l. 359-360). However, the paper claims that the method is zero-shot [1], leading to confusion on the task the method is designed for. If the method is using the first frame of the video to assign classes then it should be categorized as Video Object Segmentation [2] and compared to the baselines for this task, rather than Video Semantic Segmentation.\n2. The method is not well-validated and deserves further analysis. In Table 2, it is not clear based on the difference in mIOU and mVC whether all components are necessary to achieve the best performance. The analysis does not delve into the contributions of different components (e.g. when the feature aggregation can fail: in l. 472 it says \"some occasions\" but what occasions?) Other aspects of the model were not validated, such as choosing the features from blocks 6-8. \n3. The computational efficiency (training time, inference time and memory use on the GPU) of the non-diffusion-based baseline methods are missing. This is important in assessing the ease-of-use of the method and contributes to one's decision to apply the method.\n\n[1] \"Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation\".

For example refer to OCRNet[1] results on VSPW at 36.68% while on Cityscapes at 81.8%. While these are fully supervised models it is still not explained why unsupervised ones will act differently? It seems something is wrong in the setup. Even if the claim this has to do with the dataset resolution, that wouldn't be the case on CamVid and still why fully supervised methods face more challenges in VSPW than Camvid/Cityscapes.\n\n- Is there a way to setup their baseline for EmerDiff to just be evaluated per image? is there a reason why they are only reporting the adaptation to the video segmentation with their proposed context model. Currently, it seems their baseline is still dependant on their own adaptation so a simple comparison to image based baselines that rely on diffusion models will serve the purpose of confirming the benefit from their video based approach.\n\n- It would be interesting to see its performance w.r.t DiffSeg[2] another image based segmentation mining diffusion models with focus on attention maps.\n \n\n- While not sure but seems their ablation is conducted on part of the VSPW val set, why 30 videos only? os is this the full number of videos in the val set?\n\n[1] Yuan, Yuhui, et al. \"Segmentation Transformer: Object-Contextual Representations for Semantic Segmentation. 2021.\" 1909.\n\n[2] Frick, Raphael Antonius, and Martin Steinebach. \"DiffSeg: Towards Detecting Diffusion-Based Inpainting Attacks Using Multi-Feature Segmentation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024."

It is a nonparametric technique so it is not clear how in their figure they refer to it as undergoing some fine-tuning or adaptation when there are no parameters. An explanation of how this is done would be more suitable for that.\n\n- In their evaluation protocol they do use the labels in the first frame to assign labels, so is this really considered zero shot? Are these labels used during the correspondence refinement. Or this is solely some form of Hungarian matching during evaluation only? Why not just do this Hungarian matching per image why only first frame? I am wondering if something is wrong in the evaluation protocol that lead to the inconsistency above between VSPW vs. CamVid."

                "value": "1. Technical contributions. The proposed paper seems to heavily rely on existing works, i.e. Emerdiff [Namekata et al., 2024] to extract per-frame semantic features and generate coarse segmentation maps, with additional correspondence-based refinement (CBR) and mask modulation to refine and upsample the coarse segmentation maps. On the other hand, the proposed segmentation map refinement strategy, CBR which employ pixel-wise correspondence has been widely studied in previous work, especially video segmentation related vision tasks, e.g. Tang et al. (2023) as the authors pointed out in the paper and [a-c] etc. While the mask modulation operation is essentially a weighted summation operation to mask out latents and difference map, the overall technical contributions c.f. video semantic segmentation seems incremental and lacking significance.\n2. Sufficiency of Experiments. While the focus of the proposed work is zero-shot VSS, several aspects are missing to convincingly support authors' claims. a) It is important to show the performance gain of the proposed pipeline versus naive frame feature aggregation to prove the effectiveness of the proposed CBR and mask modulation. I.e., what is the performance like with SD spatial features + average/max pooling of the features for the final video-level segmentation? Does row 1 and 2 in Table 2 refer to a similar case? If so, it would be better to be clarified in the paper. b) While \"zero-shot\" being one of the major contributions claimed in the paper, it would be important to compare the proposed pipeline with other foundation models like SAM/SAM2. One additional minor point is that, the proposed pipeline requires GT labels to assign class labels to the segmentation map for the first frame, whether the proposed pipeline is fully \"zero-shot\" may be argueable.\n3. Computation Efficiency. The proposed pipeline for processing videos requires to process per-frame features, while also computing pixel-level correspondence (in the proposed CBR module), which is quite computationally intensive. This has also validated by the authors in the supplementary material. There has been works explored object-level correspondence for more efficient computation, e.g. [b], I wonder if the authors can provide more insights from this aspect.\n4.

However, SVD underperforms compared to SD in other results, so I agree that, compared to SD, SVD may have a more degraded feature representation (as depicted in Sec 5.3).
