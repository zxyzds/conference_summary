    "title": "Point Cloud Dataset Distillation",
    "abstract": "This study introduces dataset distillation (DD) tailored for 3D data, particularly point clouds. DD aims to substitute large-scale real datasets with a small set of synthetic samples while preserving model performance. Existing methods mainly focus on structured data such as images. However, adapting DD for unstructured point clouds poses challenges due to their diverse orientations and resolutions in 3D space. To address these challenges, we theoretically demonstrate the importance of matching rotation-invariant features between real and synthetic data for 3D distillation. We further propose a plug-and-play point cloud rotator to align the point cloud to a canonical orientation, facilitating the learning of rotation-invariant features by all point cloud models. Furthermore, instead of optimizing fixed-size synthetic data directly, we devise a point-wise generator to produce point clouds at various resolutions based on the sampled noise amount. Compared to conventional DD methods, the proposed approach, termed DD3D, enables efficient training on low-resolution point clouds while generating high-resolution data for evaluation, thereby significantly reducing memory requirements and enhancing model scalability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DD3D in shape classification and part segmentation tasks across diverse scenarios, such as cross-architecture and cross-resolution settings.",

The authors provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating why matching rotation-invariant features is crucial for 3D point cloud distillation. They formally prove that random rotations weaken the principal components of real data, leading to degraded distillation performance, which strongly motivates the rotator of their approach.\n\n3.

The significant performance drop compared to using the full dataset, while expected in dataset distillation, still represents a considerable limitation for applications requiring high accuracy. While the paper demonstrates notable improvements over existing dataset distillation methods, there are significant concerns about potential performance degradation when scaling to larger, more complex datasets or more sophisticated tasks."

In addition to the rotation invariancy, DD3D is robust to point cloud resolutions. This is achieved with a point generator that decodes 3D coordinates following a pointwise paradigm. The number of output points is the same as the dimension of the input noise.\n3. Ablation studies, particularly Table 5, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design."

While Section 5.6 provides some representative visualizations of the DDD3D-generated synthetic point clouds, it is unclear how they compare with the baseline-generated ones. As such, it is unclear how the visualization should be interpreted. I recommend the authors include side-by-side comparisons of point clouds generated by DD3D and baseline methods. This would allow readers to visually assess the differences and better interpret the visualizations.\n\n2. The proposed method appears to be limited to shape-level tasks. It is not straightforward to apply DD3D to large-scale scene-level tasks. In particular, there may not be a well-defined canonical frame for the diverse scene-level point clouds."

I understand that the most important assumption is that $f_\\theta$ must be rotation-equivalent. The fundamental design of this paper relies on addressing the fact that existing models are not rotation-equivalent. What about the other assumptions? For example, the classifier is assumed to be linear and the classification loss is assumed to be MSE. I do not believe the actual experiment follows these assumptions. It would be great if the authors could provide some clarification on whether the theoretical results can be easily transferred. Rigorous proofs are not necessary but some insightful analysis will be great.\n\n- To follow up on the previous point, perhaps a toy example can be beneficial to illustrate the concept. Consider generating a small collection of 3D shapes and comparing the performance of a shape classification model trained with aligned and misaligned orientations. Can we gain any insights from this toy example?\n\n- Nit: On line 122, $V$ is likely a vector of integers instead of generic real numbers."
