    "title": "SE3Set: Harnessing equivariant hypergraph neural networks for molecular representation learning",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning. Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.",

                "value": "This paper introduces SE3Set, an SE(3)-equivariant hypergraph neural network designed for molecular representation learning. The main contributions include: a novel fragmentation method that combines 2D chemical and 3D spatial information, a hypergraph neural network architecture that captures many-body interactions, and integration of SE(3) equivariance within the hypergraph framework. The method shows comparable performance to SOTA on small molecule datasets (QM9, MD17) and claims ~20% improvement on larger molecules in MD22."

The fragmentation method is well-designed, offering both explicit and implicit overlap schemes while preserving chemical intuition through maintaining functional groups and rings.\n\n3. The implementation is thoroughly documented with detailed algorithms, parameters, and clear pseudocode for reproducibility.\n\n4.

The computational efficiency analysis is inadequate, lacking detailed benchmarks of training time, memory usage, and scaling properties compared to baseline methods.\n\n3. The complexity analysis in Appendix H needs more rigor and real-world benchmarking data to support the theoretical claims.\n\n4. The method cannot handle certain molecule types in MD22 (like the Buckyball catcher), limiting its applicability to complex molecular systems.\n\n5. The selection of hyperparameters, particularly cutoff values, appears arbitrary without clear guidelines for practitioners."

How do you recommend practitioners balance this trade-off?\n\n3. The improvement on MD22 is attributed to better capturing of many-body interactions. Can you provide additional evidence or analysis to support this claim?\n\n4. How does the method scale with system size? Could you provide complexity analysis for both time and memory usage as a function of number of atoms and fragments?\n\n5. Have you considered extending the method to handle periodic systems or crystal structures? What modifications would be required?"

Basically, SE3Set uses hypergraphs constructed based on a fragmentation strategy to represent many-body interactions and then develops an SE(3)-equivariant network to learn from the hypergraph. It\u2019s an extension of hypergraph neural network (which was proposed for graphs without 3D information) and tensor product-based equivariant models.\n\nSE3Set\u2019s performance is demonstrated on several widely used benchmarks for molecular representation learning, including QM9, MD17, and MD22.

SE3Set applies the idea of fragmentation to construct the many-body interactions of interest. This is a promising approach.\n\n2. It is valuable to incorporate SE(3) equivariance into the hypergraph framework. In addition, the update rules (E2V and V2E) proposed in this work are very natural, compared to the existing AllSet framework for hypergraphs without 3D information.\n\n3. The manuscript is well organized and easy to follow. I enjoy reading this work."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The experiment results are not so strong and comprehensive. \n- On three benchmarks, SE3Set shows notable improvements on MD22 but performs quite similarly to many existing methods on QM9 and MD17. I understand that it is claimed that SE3Set is more effective on large molecules where many-body interactions are more important. To support this claim well, experiments on more large molecule benchmarks should be provided. \n\n- SE3Set operates on hypergraphs and such hypergraphs are constructed based on overlapped fragments, which might bring memory and computation overhead. However, there is no analysis on the complexity of SE3Set and the experimental comparison in terms of memory and running time is also missing.\n\n2. The ablation studies are not convincing, thus cannot support the main claim strongly. SE3Set\u2019s performance is mainly demonstrated on MD22 but the ablation on fragmentation and E2V architecture is performed on one selected task on QM9. This is somewhat contradictory to the main claim that SE3Set (and the associated fragmentation strategy) is more effective for large molecule settings."

While many previous works have focused on the design of hypergraph structures and ensuring equivariance, the main contribution of the authors appears to be the proposal of a new fragmentation method. However, compared to existing fragmentation methods, the improvements introduced in this paper seem modest, and the differences primarily lie in the specific tasks each method is suited for, with each having its own strengths.\n2. The paper\u2019s performance on the QM9 and MD17 datasets is relatively unimpressive. While it emphasizes strong results on the MD22 dataset, the mediocre performance on the two datasets related to dynamic properties raises concerns about the practical applicability and generalizability of the proposed method, as real-world drug design tasks are closely related to these datasets. Additionally, given the emphasis on the method\u2019s effectiveness for macromolecular data where interaction is crucial, I am curious about its performance on the LBA dataset."
