    "title": "PoseCheck: Generative Models for 3D Structure-based Drug Design Produce Unrealistic Poses",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models for structure-based drug design (SBDD), where molecule generation is conditioned on a 3D protein pocket, have received considerable interest in recent years. These methods offer the promise of higher-quality molecule generation by explicitly modelling the 3D interaction between a potential drug and a protein receptor. However, previous work has primarily focused on the quality of the generated molecules themselves, with limited evaluation of the 3D poses that these methods produce, with most work simply discarding the generated pose and only reporting a \u201ccorrected\u201d pose after redocking with traditional methods. Little is known about whether generated molecules satisfy known physical constraints for binding and the extent to which redocking alters the generated interactions. We introduce POSECHECK, an extensive benchmarking suite for state-of-the-art SBDD methods and find that generated molecules have significantly more physical violations and fewer key interactions compared to baselines, calling into question the implicit assumption that providing rich 3D structure information improves molecule complementarity. We make recommendations for future research tackling identified failure modes and hope our benchmark will serve as a springboard for future SBDD generative modelling work to have a real-world impact.",

Four new metrics are introduced from the perspective of physical constraints, including redocked RMSD, steric clashes, interaction profile, and strain energy.

                "value": "The paper effectively highlights a critical issue in the current SBDD field, the evaluation metrics. The authors propose a two-tier approach to assessing SBDD-generated molecules: evaluating the intrinsic quality of the generated molecules and examining their structural conformations. For the latter, they introduce new metrics to address current limitations. While, from an application standpoint, the primary requirement is for SBDD models to produce effective small molecules capable of interacting with the binding pocket, supervising the quality of generated 3D conformations could offer valuable insights for further model refinement."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. On the rationale of the strain energy metric: The energy change should ideally be observed as a whole, considering both the protein and the small molecule before and after binding, rather than focusing solely on the strain energy of the small molecule. \"..., generally speaking, lower strain energy results in more favourable binding interactions and potentially more effective therapeutics.\" This assumption is inaccurate. When evaluating whether a protein and a small molecule are likely to bind and form a complex, the energy change of the protein cannot be neglected. Furthermore, as the authors pointed out, the generated poses are often problematic. The strain energy introduced by the authors may be influenced more by the generated pose itself than by the intended evaluation of the binding affinity or stability of the protein-ligand complex.\n2. Regarding interaction fingerprinting, the authors present a distribution analysis of interaction fingerprints for several current models, noting significant deviations from the CrossDocked benchmark. However, the sheer number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors does not determine the quality of the generated molecules. For instance, an excess of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors may reduce the selectivity of the small molecule, while selectivity is crucial in real-world pharmaceutical applications.\n3. These metrics cannot directly guide drug discovery in real-world scenarios. Regarding redocked RMSD, the importance of this metric depends on how we define the function of SBDD models and what we expect for them. From a practical application perspective, the role of an SBDD model is  to provide potential candidate molecules, without necessarily ensuring the accuracy of their binding conformations."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. We know that the size of generated molecules has a significant impact on the docking score. For instance, in pocket2mol, as the sampled molecules increase in size, the Vina score tends to improve. It would be valuable to experimentally verify whether these new metrics are influenced by molecular size. Intuitively, the number of clashes is likely related to molecule size. A robust metric should ideally be unbiased concerning molecule size.\n2. In the interaction analysis, it was observed that methods like diffsbdd, ligan, and decompdiff show a reduction in the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors after redocking. This is somewhat unexpected. What could be the possible reasons? Could this indicate that SBDD models are more sensitive to hydrogen bonding than redocking software?\n3. Why does pocket2mol achieve similar performance to CrossDocked in terms of strain energy, despite not showing significant advantages in other metrics?What could be the possible reasons?"

Regarding interaction fingerprints, I agree that it is meaningful and interpretable to observe the interactions present in the generated complex conformations. However, the analysis and conclusions in this section are not sufficiently clear or thorough. For instance, I still do not understand how to evaluate a method in relation to the distribution of interaction counts. Is a higher number better, or is it more favorable for the distribution to be closer to that of the test set?"

Regarding the strain energy metric, should we only consider the strain energy of the individual molecule, or do we also need to account for the strain energy associated with conformational changes in the protein target?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. As a benchmark, the evaluation in this article is far from comprehensive. Many recent works on antibody design and optimization are missing from the comparison, including GraphBP[1], VoxBind [2], MolCraft [3], and D3FG [4]. To the best of my knowledge, [2] and [3] are state-of-the-art methods, and all of the codes for these methods are open-sourced which I have tested. The lack of discussion and comparison with such a substantial body of related work is a major weakness.\n\n2. Additionally, I believe the evaluation method in this article is far from comprehensive. First, aside from interactions, evaluating the molecular topology and structure in both 2D and 3D dimensions is essential. If the generated molecule is merely in a low-energy state (as described by DiffBP, where larger molecules can produce more interactions, thus lowering affinity) but significantly deviates from real drug data in terms of structure and chemical functional groups, can we truly consider that the generated molecule has an advantage?\nHere, I have listed several methods and their examples in evaluating 3D geometric properties and 2D structural properties, refered to recently proposed benchmark paper [5], none of which have been considered in this article. \n| Method       | Substructure       | Geometry                  |\n|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| LIGAN        | Figure. S6         | Figure. S7, S8, S9        |\n| POCKET2MOL   | Table. 2           | Table. 3; Figure. 4       |\n| GRAPHBP      | -                  | Table. 2; Figure. 5       |\n| TARGETDIFF   | Table. 2           | Table. 1; Figure. 2       |\n| DIFFBP       | Table. 3           | -                         |\n| DIFFSBDD     | -                  | Figure. 8, 9              |\n| FLAG         | Table. 3           | Table. 2; Figure. 4       |\n| D3FG         | Table. 1, 3; Figure. 3 | Table. 2             |\n| DECOMPDiff   | -                  | Table. 1, 2; Figure. 3    |\n| MOLCRAFT     | Table. 1           | Table. 2                  |\n| VOXBIND      | -                  | Figure. 7                 |\n\n3. The conclusions in this paper also have significant issues. For example, in line 376, it states, \u201cInterestingly, DiffSBDD and TargetDiff, which are considered state-of-the-art based on mean docking score evaluations.\u201d However, DiffSBDD performs poorly in terms of the Vina score compared to other methods, indicating that its generated initial conformations are quite unstable. Yet, its final redocked energy is very low. Could this be due to the fact that the molecules generated by DiffSBDD have a higher molecular weight than those generated by other methods? If so, is this comparison truly fair? The Vina score is an essential metric for evaluating the quality of the generated initial conformations, and it should not be overlooked. Overall, the conclusions and analyses are overly simplistic and lack comprehensiveness. \n\n4. The writing and presentation of this article are quite mediocre. For instance, the generation strategies, detailed introductions of methods include the model architecture and generative models, and classifications of these methods are not reflected in the tables, making the table arrangement appear rather arbitrary and unstructured.\n\nIn summary, I believe the evaluation in this article is incomplete, as it lacks many essential and reproducible methods. The conclusions are not sufficiently in-depth, and for existing methods, the article merely conducts a single test, followed by evaluations from various angles. In terms of both workload and quality, this paper falls short of the standards required for a high-level conference like ICLR. Therefore, I recommend rejection.\n\n[1] Meng Liu, Youzhi Luo, Kanji Uchino, Koji Maruhashi, and Shuiwang Ji. Generating 3d molecules for target protein binding.
