    "title": "Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs",
    "abstract": "Dynamic graphs provide a flexible data abstraction for modelling many sorts of real-world systems, such as transport, trade, and social networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem.\n\nIn this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. \n\nOne of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. \n\nWe provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated.",

                "value": "The purpose of this paper is to provide valid prediction sets (with finite sample guarantees) achieved through conformal prediction for GNNs on dynamic graphs. In this setting, the graph evolves through time and can thus be represented as a set of adjacency matrices\" nodes are fixed, but edges can appear and disappear at each time point. Each node is also endowed with a set of potentially varying features and labels.\n\nTo provide prediction sets (ie, sets of labels for each nodes such that the real label is within the set with, say, 95% probability), the authors suggest leveraging unfolding, a tool stemming from the tensor literature. The procedure they describe is as follows:\n- 1- create an unfolded adjacency by concatenating all the adjacency matrices (columnwise),  yielding a matrix of size 2nT  * 2nT. Same for the features: X_unf is of size nTp.\n- 2- apply a GNN on the unfolded adjacencies and features to output a set of global representations for each of the nodes (meaning, global across time points), and \"local\" representations (node/time pairs).\n- 3 -compute conformity scores to output prediction sets.\n\nThe authors  show that this procedure can help them get uncertainty estimates for 3 types of scenarios: transductive, timewise transductive, and semi-transductive.\nThe authors then proceed to show the results of numerous experiments (synthetic and on real data). More specifically, they use as benchmark a block GNN (GNN fitted on the block diagonal adjacency, essentially treating each snapshot as a different graph). The authors show that the block approach creates \"block\" effects when there should be none, and this also results in higher accuracy of the UGNNs over the block approach, and lower set sizes."

                "value": "On the whole, I think this is a good paper, but perhaps a couple of modifications would clarify certain aspects:\n1- Some of the notations could be clarified. For instance, I found the part explaining the procedure a little confusing. More specifically:\n- $\\hat{X}^{UNF}$: since X is already used to describe features, another letter would be preferable here. I originally thought that it meant the unfolded features.\n- Similarly,  $\\hat{Y}^{UNF},$ I thought this meant the unfolded labels.\n- It would be great to add the dimensions (only  $\\hat{X}^{UNF}$ is indicated to have dimension $n_r \\times d$). \n- Would it be possible to replace $n_r$ by $n$? I personally find the subscript to be more justified to indicate a refinement, such as when, say, there would be different numbers of nodes across time points. I (personally) find that here, it invites more questions than would be necessary.\n\n2- the UGNN framework could be further detailed:\n- I am personally not familiar with the dilated unfolding approach of Davis, and consequently don't really understand the training procedure. $Y^{UNF}$ corresponds to the time-node pairs, so they should be trained with the node/pair labels?\n\n3- the current challenges in deploying CP to graphs could be clearer: it seems to me that the main contribution of the paper is the unfolding mechanism, that allows (a) better representation of nodes in embedding spaces, and that consequently (b)  lends itself well to UQ using CP. Maybe a reformulation of the introduction highlighting that some of the challenges in CP on graph embeddings would be a distribution shift of the embeddings if there is a batch effect could help highlight the contribution of the method. Currently, it is succintly mentioned (\"de-alignment between embeddings across time points\"), but I think this should be expanded upon to highlight current challenges and set the context a bit more clearly."

Quality and Clarity: The authors provided clean and rigorous theoretical analysis in explaining how its method achieves valid predictions under varied dynamic settings, supported by well-defined assumptions and conditions for applicability in different inference scenarios. Visualizations like bar graphs and tables further help readers understand the reasonableness and benefits of the unfolded approach compared to the baseline. \n\n3.

The basic idea for this approach seems to have great potential for scaling up, therefore advancing the applicability of GNNs with evolving edges."

                "value": "1. Semi-Inductive Settings:\n\nAs the authors acknowledged, the assumption of exchangeability may not hold in many real-world cases, necessary discussions for mitigating it would be appreciated. For instance, if adapting robust techniques from time-series, like basic ARIMAs, or even neural SDEs might be useful. \n\n2. Understanding UQ:\n\nThough I acknowledged the authors\u2019 efforts in providing extensive metrics, it would be insightful to how to interpret the size of prediction sets correlates with meaningful uncertainty in a dynamic graph. This could help researchers from other backgrounds understand the logic, and make benefits for them. Making a plot showing the coverage (if possible) will make the paper more solid.\n\n3. Miscellaneous:\n\nI suggested the reviewers consider the following issues, and if time allows, do some elaboration.\n\na) If there is any other way to reshape the dynamic graph from $(T, N, N)$ into a 2D-shape, e.g. compared the performance the reshaped matrix in shape $(T, N^2)$.\n\nb) Another simplification on the current $A^{UHF}$ might be: $A^{(1)}$ at top left, and the remaining unfolded $\\mathcal{A}$ dilated in the same way. I would consider if this will somehow reduce the complexity, especially when $T << N$.\n\nc) In this paper the dynamical graphs always mean edge-evolving ones. There are also cases where nodes are evolving with time, or even both edges and nodes are changing, e.g. pandemic networks (with different types of nodes, and some nodes will disappear permanently). It is appreciated if authors can do some brainstorming on this topic to provide meaningful improvements."

Needs to explain.\n\nLines 161-165: for better understanding, I would prefer the authors directly used $m$ over $m + 1$ (surely some other formula like \nAlgorithm 1 also needs to be changed). But this is more neat.\n\nLine 165: it is not encouraged to mix superscripts and subscripts in notation, especially when they share the same meanings (e.g. test pairs and calibration pairs).\n\nLine 179: do we have any differences if we use row- rather than column-concatenation? I guess they might be the same. Please think about this.\n\nLine 222: does column swapping means permutation? For example, is it equivalent to say, there exists a permutation matrix $P$. such that $PA^{UNF}P^T=A^{UNF, swapped}$?\n\nSection 2.1 and Figure 1: If you can plot $A^{(1)}$ as a 2D heatmap, or the original graph using tools like networkx package, it will be better for illustration rather than just representation scatter plots. For example, the density of nodes or the color of heatmap may clear show what happened in this toy system.\n\nFigure 2: needs a short comment on SBM evolving edges. Why is that?"
