    "abstract": "Patch representation learning has emerged as a crucial innovation in software development, leveraging machine learning techniques to advance software generation workflows. This approach has led to significant enhancements across various applications involving code alterations. However, existing methods often exhibit a tendency towards specialization, excelling predominantly in either predictive tasks such as security patch classification or in generative tasks like the automated creation of patch descriptions. This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to patch representation learning through the Image-Guided Code Patch Framework (IGCP), a novel architecture that bridges the gap between code analysis and image processing domains. We introduce a rigorous mathematical foundation for IGCP, leveraging measure theory, functional analysis, and information geometry to formalize the domain adaptation process in patch representation learning. The optimization dynamics of IGCP are rigorously analyzed through the lens of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, providing convergence guarantees in both convex and non-convex loss landscapes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IGCP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in patch description generation but also exhibits remarkable domain generalization capabilities.",

                "value": "This paper first presents Image-Guided Code Patch Framework (IGCP) for patch representation learning for code analysis. Then, the authors introduce several mathematical formulations for IGCP. \n\nThe problem is poorly introduced, the technical approach does not seem to be related and the writing looks very unnatural. While it mentions \"image-guided\", I do not see where image comes from and how it is related to software patches, which is also not well-defined. There are no clear connections between the problem with mathematical frameworks introduced, and how metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE come from. I think this submission is poorly written."

Patch representation learning is essential for tasks like bug detection, vulnerability assessment, and code optimization. Existing methods often specialize in either predictive tasks (e.g., security patch classification) or generative tasks (e.g., automated patch description generation), leading to a trade-off between understanding and generation capabilities.\n\nIGCP aims to bridge this gap by integrating code analysis with image processing. The framework treats code patches as probability measures on Polish spaces, providing a rigorous measure-theoretic foundation. This allows for a nuanced understanding of the probabilistic structures inherent in diverse coding domains."

After careful reading, the proposed methodology remains ambiguous and lacks coherence. The entirety of Section 3 feels like a collection of complex mathematical definitions that seem disconnected from one another, without a clear explanation of how they contribute to the overall methodology.\n2. The theoretical analysis is very weak and sometimes lacks clear definition. For example, in theorem 3.1 the final claim is that \"If $k$ is characteristic, then the mapping $Z \\to \\mu_Z$ is injective. However, commonly this claim itself serves as the definition of a kernel $k$ being characteristic. Similar situations happen at multiple other places, where the assumption is too strong to reduce the claim to some very obvious facts.\n3. The paper is not clearly finished at various places. For example, in line 351, 355, 365, 368, the equations or texts after the colon is missing. This makes it very hard to comprehend what the authors wanted to express.\n4. The experiment setting is very unclear, and I don't understand why all the experiment sections are italicized, making it very difficult to read. In line 428, the author states 'to evaluate the performance of IPPMF'. However, there is no mentioning of what 'IPPMF' is anywhere in the paper."
