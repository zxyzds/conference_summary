    "title": "Enhancing Cross-Lingual and Cross-Domain Adaptability in Large Language Models for Software Engineering",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a groundbreaking mathematical framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in the context of cross-lingual and cross-domain code modeling. We introduce the Enhanced Dynamic Code Modeling (UDA-EDCM) system, which leverages advanced concepts from measure theory, differential geometry, and information geometry to address the challenges posed by the diversity of natural and programming languages. At the core of UDA-EDCM is a novel measure-theoretic formulation of domain adaptation, utilizing optimal transport theory to minimize the discrepancy between source and target domains. We develop a Riemannian manifold approach to feature space alignment, introducing a Geodesic Flow Kernel that captures the intrinsic geometry of the code representation space. The UDA-EDCM operator is analyzed through the lens of functional analysis, revealing its spectral properties and their implications for generalization. Our information-theoretic bound on domain adaptation provides insights into the fundamental limits of knowledge transfer in code modeling. We present a unified theorem that synthesizes these diverse mathematical perspectives, offering a comprehensive characterization of UDA-EDCM's performance in terms of Wasserstein distance, empirical Rademacher complexity, and Fisher information. This theoretical foundation is complemented by an innovative optimization framework based on the Fisher Information Metric, ensuring efficient convergence in the probabilistic manifold of model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDA-EDCM significantly outperforms existing approaches in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios across a wide range of programming languages and coding tasks. Our work not only advances the baselines in domain adaptation for code intelligence but also establishes a rigorous mathematical basis for future research in adaptive AI systems for software engineering.",

For example, abstract concepts, control flow, and dependency relationships in code are difficult to represent with simple vectors, which may affect the effectiveness of domain adaptation. b) Dynamic code structure: The structure of code evolves with version changes, such as code refactoring and evolution. How does UDA-EDCM handle this dynamism in software engineering and ensure the adaptability of the model across different code versions?\n- This work uses information geometry methods for model optimization, but this approach may have limitations. For instance, the computation of the Fisher information matrix can be complex and computationally intensive, affecting the efficiency of model training. The paper lacks discussion and experiments on computational complexity.\n- I am concerned about the match between theory and experiment. The experiments provided in the article are too sparse to verify the following: Can the theoretical bounds proposed in the article accurately predict the actual performance of the UDA-EDCM model? Do the theoretical assumptions proposed in the article, such as the Wasserstein distance, fully capture the differences between the source and target domains? Can the feature space used in the article effectively capture the semantics and structure of the code?\n- The readability of the article is poor, especially in the experimental section."

The poor formatting of the paper makes it feel incomplete.\n\n- The paper should provide intuition for its theoretical results. As it reads now, the implication of each theorem is missing. Instead, the authors simply state the theorem followed by a proof. I would suggest placing the proofs in the Appendix so that the main paper can focus on the \"why?\" for each theorem.\n\n- It is unclear what the proposed algorithm is. I read through the paper multiple times, but it seems Section 3 talks about theoretical results and Section 4 immediately jumps into experimental results without any explanation of what UDA-EDCM is. Furthermore, the only Figure explaining the algorithm, Figure 1, is not referenced anywhere in the text.\n\n- The experimental evidence is not clearly explained. The authors simply list the performance improvements in Section 4.3 and 4.4, with no explanation why the performance is improved.\n\n- The authors should provide more explanation why they do not compare against any general-purpose large language models such as CodeLlama, Llama, GPT, DeepSeekCoder, Claude, or Mistral."

Concepts like the Geodesic Flow Kernel and operator-theoretic analysis, while innovative, are presented with minimal intuitive explanations. More concrete examples and visualizations would help.\n2. The use of differential geometry and spectral analysis introduces significant complexity, which may hinder practical adoption. While the theoretical results are elegant, the applicability of these advanced techniques in real-world, large-scale software engineering environments is not sufficiently addressed. The computational overhead introduced by Riemannian manifold calculations and optimal transport may outweigh the performance gains in practical applications, especially when working with large datasets or resource-constrained systems.\n3. The experimental evaluation is comprehensive in terms of comparing the UDA-EDCM framework with other models on several tasks, but it lacks diversity in the types of programming languages and paradigms tested. While the paper demonstrates performance across multiple languages, it does not evaluate the framework's adaptability to more niche or specialized programming paradigms (e.g., functional, logic, or domain-specific languages). This limits the generalizability of the framework in complex, real-world codebases.\n4. The scalability of UDA-EDCM to industrial-scale codebases is not fully discussed. Many modern software projects involve millions of lines of code with highly varied styles, legacy code, and mixed programming paradigms. The experiments presented focus on smaller-scale tasks, but how well the proposed framework scales in terms of both memory and processing time is not clear. There is a need to test the approach on significantly larger datasets or long-term maintenance tasks involving evolving codebases.\n5. The paper does not provide sufficient ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components, such as the Geodesic Flow Kernel or the information-theoretic bounds. Since UDA-EDCM is a complex framework with multiple innovations, understanding which parts contribute the most to performance is crucial for practical adoption. Including ablation studies would make the experimental results more convincing by demonstrating the impact of each component."

The paper claims to handle cross-lingual tasks effectively, but how does the model perform with truly low-resource programming languages? Are there any specific limitations in such scenarios?\n3. The framework relies on complex mathematical operations, including Riemannian geometry and functional analysis. How does this affect the model's computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale, real-world deployments?"
