    "title": "Sports-Traj: A Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent Movement in Sports",
    "abstract": "Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, \\textbf{\\textit{Basketball-U}}, \\textbf{\\textit{Football-U}}, and \\textbf{\\textit{Soccer-U}}, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports. Our datasets, code, and model weights are available at~\\href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniTraj-ICLR25/README.md}{link}.",

They extend the Mamba model into a bidirectional temporal Mamba for the purpose to enhance the temporal dependencies with a transformer encoder for feature extractor. The proposed method aims to. solve the trajectory prediction, imputation and spatial-temporal recovery tasks in a unified paradigm. The applied methods are designed specified to the sports scenarios but some proposed modules can be appliable to more general tasks. The authors construct several sport scenario focused datasets with existing datasets. On the proposed benchmarking platform, the proposed method achieves good experimental results."

With also tracking and forecasting the ball motion, the proposed method can be useful for the related sport activities..\n- The proposed ghost masking embedding used to replace the usual head token can provide the order-invariant properties to the agent features, which can be extended to many related applications without losing generalization.\n- Built upon the usual Mamba blocks, the proposed Bidirectional Temporal Mamba provides an improved fashion of processing spatial-temporal features with good adaptation to handle features on missing time steps.\n- On the sports datasets, Basketball, Soccer and Football videos, the proposed method shows good quantitative results when compared to other related works.\n- Overall, the paper is well written and the technical section can be easily followed."

                "value": "1. My main concern about the proposed method is its generalizability. To be precise, the proposed method is evaluated on the three datasets Basketball-U, Soccer-U and Football-U, which are built by the authors themselves thus lacking a well established benchmarking. Therefore, it is hard to estimate the significance of the experimental performance by the provided benchmarking results. I would suggest the authors to add the experiments on the existing benchmarks, such as SDD, ETH/UCY or HM3.6M and include the recently published trajectory prediction methods into the comparison for a more convincing and well-established benchmarking.\n2. The proposed methods model the ball trajectory and offensive/defensive player position explicitly. It is not clear whether the other baselines also follow this convention. For many previous works on NBA benchmark, based on which Basketball-U dataset is constructed, only the players position is considered. Such details of implementation alignment between the proposed method and baseline methods included in the benchmark results is critical to conduct a fair experiment and provide reliable experimental evidence.\n3. There are many more recent related works, though they are mostly published on the benchmarking of ETH/UCY and SDD, should have been included in the experimental comparison, to provide a up-to-date evaluation of the quantitative significance of the proposed method.

What is the variability among these 20 trajectories?
