    "title": "SPACT18: Spiking Human Action Recognition Benchmark Dataset with Complementary RGB and Thermal Modalities",
    "abstract": "Spike cameras, bio-inspired vision sensors, asynchronously fire spikes by accumulating light intensities at each pixel, offering ultra-high energy efficiency and exceptional temporal resolution. Unlike event cameras, which record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR) dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities, to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking, thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding, specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.",

It is commendable that the author considered multiple variables in the process of constructing the dataset. In addition, the author's introduction is complete and logically fluent, with good narrative quality. In the methodology section, the author provides a complete introduction to the data construction process, its basic data architecture, and the most important event data alignment steps. However, in the experimental section, the author only tested the effectiveness of two typical algorithms and used the ANN-SNN conversion to test the performance of the SNN algorithm, which is incomplete. In future work, a larger number of ANN algorithms should be supplemented for testing to verify the stability of the distribution of the SPACT18 dataset. In addition, algorithm testing based entirely on SNN is also necessary. In summary, this article provides a large-scale VAR dataset based on events and innovatively proposes an event alignment strategy, which is in line with the logic and innovation required for conference papers."

Is there an analysis of the contribution of each frame to the video action recognition task? I believe that different cumulative states of the event stream can be equivalent to one frame of video image, and the contribution of each frame will be particularly prominent in the event camera;"

The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing action recognition datasets, particularly in terms of modality, participant diversity, types of activities, sample size, and duration. Given that the primary contribution of this work is the proposed dataset, a clear comparison would help emphasize its advantages over existing datasets.\n2. The paper cites only one spike-based action recognition dataset (Amir et al., 2021). However, there exist other spike-based action recognition datasets, such as (Wang et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2021, Miao et al., 2019). It would be beneficial for the authors to consider these datasets in their comparison and explore whether any other relevant action recognition datasets are available.\n3. Could you provide the confusion matrix for one or several models in Table 3? Since some activities in the proposed dataset overlap with those in [Amir et al., 2021], a confusion matrix could help determine if the additional activities are sufficiently discriminative and enhance the dataset's value.\n4. The authors clearly specify the recording devices and versions for the thermal and RGB data. However, the spike camera is not similarly described. Could you include details about this device for completeness?\n5. I have a question regarding the proposed compression method. Specifically, what distinguishes the approach of calculating frequency first and then using IF neurons from directly employing leaky LIF neurons? Would using leaky LIF neurons potentially offer a simpler and more direct solution?\n\nWang et al., 2024, DailyDVS-200: A Comprehensive Benchmark Dataset for Event-Based Action Recognition, ECCV.\nLiu et al., 2021, Event-based Action Recognition Using Motion Information and Spiking Neural Networks, IJCAI.\nMiao et al., 2019, Neuromorphic vision datasets for pedestrian detection, action recognition, and fall detection.

                "value": "1. The experimental setup and analysis are not sufficiently thorough.  The dataset is aimed at benchmarking Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for action recognition tasks, but the paper does not include any direct evaluation using SNN-based methods. Since the core claim is that this dataset enables effective benchmarking for SNNs, its advantages in temporal processing remain unproven without such an evaluation. Including results from SNN-specific architectures or methodologies (eg. directly trained SNN models and ANN-SNN conversion methods) would strengthen the paper\u2019s contribution to the field.\n\n2. The dataset's scale and diversity are limited compared to established RGB video action recognition benchmarks such as HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, which feature far more action classes (51, 101, and 400, respectively). SPACT18 includes only 18 action classes and a significantly lower number of training clips. This restricts its utility for developing models that generalize well across diverse action recognition tasks, limiting the dataset\u2019s value for broader use in the community.\n\n3. Overclaiming on Spike Camera superiority. The paper claims that spike cameras offer significant advantages over event cameras. However, this claim is not supported by sufficient evidence or direct comparisons. To substantiate such claims, the authors should provide side-by-side evaluations of spike and event camera performance, particularly in relevant tasks like video action recognition, or refer to studies that have explored these comparisons in depth.\n\n4. The paper overstates the complexity of action recognition relative to tasks such as optical flow estimation, motion estimation, depth estimation, or image reconstruction [L133-138]. Action recognition, being a classification task, is often less complex than these tasks, which involve per-pixel regression and dense predictions. It would be more accurate to frame action recognition as an important but distinct problem, rather than more complex, to avoid misrepresentation."

From Table 4, it appears that performance using spike data is consistently lower, and Figure 6 shows that spike data is quite blurry, which may make it harder for models to learn meaningful dynamic information. How do you address these limitations, and in what situations does spike data excel over other modalities?"
