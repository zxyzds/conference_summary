    "title": "ShuffleNorm: A Better Normalization for Semi-supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "We identify critical challenges with normalisation layers commonly used in fully supervised learning when applied to semi-supervised settings. Specifically, batch normalisation (BN) can experience severe performance degradation when labelled and unlabelled data have mismatched label distributions, due to biased statistical estimation. This results in unstable gradients, hindering the model's ability to converge effectively. While group/layer normalisation (GN/LN) avoids these issues, it lacks the stochastic regularisation provided by BN, leading to weaker generalisation. Poor generalisation, in turn, produces low-quality pseudo-labels, exacerbating confirmation bias. To address these limitations, we propose novel normalisation techniques termed Shuffle Layer normalisation and Shuffle Group normalisation (SLN/SGN) that introduce controllable randomness into LN/GN without increasing model parameters, thus making semi-supervised learning more robust and effective. Through experiments across diverse datasets, including image, text, and audio modalities, we demonstrate that SLN/SGN significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms.",

                "value": "The work identifies an issue with the batch-norm layer in the case of semi-supervised learning.\nThe authors postulate the loss in performance is due to mixing statistics of supervised and weakly-supervised samples, making the BN statistics inaccurate. The authors further postulate that while the layer/group normalization approaches don't suffer the same limitation, they lack some of the regularization achieved with randomness of batch statistics.\nThe author propose a method that corrects the standard batch-independent mu/sigma from layer/group normalization algorithms with a batch-dependent component that results from the shuffling of the samples inside the batch."

This is difficult combo-move to pull-off.\nThe experimental results are very convincing, almost too good to be true. I don't deny that they are true, just that the improvement shown by such a simple method is somewhat unexpected by my mental model at least. The improvement on STL10 and UrbanSound is massive.\nThe fact the paper presents experimental results across a large set of benchmarks, datasets and modality is also a big plus IMO.\nFinally the fact the method is so simple, it doesn't require more parameters, and I understand can be added on top of pre-trained models (that were training using standard batch-norm / layer-norm) is also a huge plus."

It finds that Batch Normalization (BN) suffers performance degradation when labeled and unlabeled data have different label distributions. While Group/Layer Normalization (GN/LN) avoids this issue, it lacks the stochastic regularization of BN, hindering generalization and pseudo-label quality. The authors propose Shuffle Group/Layer Normalization (SGN/SLN), which introduces randomness into GN/LN without new parameters. Experiments across image, text, and audio datasets show SGN/SLN improves semi-supervised learning performance compared to BN and GN/LN, as well as enhancing the performance obtained by some models.  The authors analyze this improvement through the lens of randomness regularization and Hessian eigenvalue analysis which indicates SGN/SLN smooths the loss landscape."

                "value": "1. All the tasks that are being assessed are classification tasks which diminishes the credibility of the actual results of the proposed method. The authors should also include estimation tasks (e.g. audio source separation) and generative tasks (e.g. machine translation) to get a better understanding whether the proposed layers work in a variety of tasks.\n\n2. The authors include very basic baseline architectures in their experiments which also diminishes the value of their laims about improving the performance of several models. All the models used are some from 2021 papers and if anyone visits the latest state-of-the-art models for all theses tasks on any datasets are very different models that are being used. It could be the case that this regularization works for some basic transformer models under some training conditions on some specific tasks that help the models converge faster to some good solution but the effect will go away as more training steps are being completed. For instance, I can easily find over the internet multiple architectures the have way higher performance for semi-supervised training (e.g. see [A] for ~80% accuracy in semi-supervised training). In order for the authors to show significance in their results, then they need to get a SOTA architecture + loss + way of training and after they match it simply replace the normalization layers tos how that their method works.\n\n3. Following up on my previous claim, it seems that when the authors tried to do that (see Table 8 with ResNet50 experiments on fully supervised Imagenet) then the results were not great at all which makes me even more skeptical about the validity of this method. Specifically, we already know that one can get over 80% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet with ResNet50 using various tricks [B] but the authors report that their regularization trick only achieves a minor increase 76 -> 76.3%.\n\n[A] Xu, J.W. and Yeh, Y.R., 2024, July.

                "value": "1) The core idea of introducing randomness into normalization layers is not entirely new. Other techniques, such as dropout, have explored similar concepts. The dropout introduce randomness to enhance the generalization ability of the model. Randomly drops out neurons (along with their connections) during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not dependent on the presence of specific neurons. While this paper randomizes the normalization statistics by shuffling the order of samples in a batch. This introduces noise into the normalization process, preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific batch statistics.\n2) The paper primarily relies on empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of SLN/SGN. There need a more rigorous theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works. How does the introduced randomness affect the optimization landscape? Does it lead to a smoother loss surface with fewer local minima, potentially explaining the improved performance?\n3) The paper mainly compares SLN/SGN with BN and GN/LN. A more comprehensive comparison with other semi-supervised learning techniques, such as consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling methods, would provide a better understanding of the method's performance relative to the state-of-the-art. I recommed add comparision methods such as MixMatch, FixMatch and pseudo-labeling method.\n4) While compatibility with pre-trained models is a strength, it also implies that the method's effectiveness may be limited when pre-trained models are not available or suitable. Based on the evaluation, the authors should discuss the implications of their findings for situations where appropriate pre-trained models are not readily available."
