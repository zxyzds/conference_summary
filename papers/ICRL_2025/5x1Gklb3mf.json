    "title": "Learning Phase Representations for Microstructural Segmentation in Metallographic Images through Expert Knowledge",
    "abstract": "Automated segmentation of metallographic images containing multiple phases such as martensite, ferrite, and pearlite is essential for quantifying different phases and thereby helping in the understanding properties of materials. Segmentation of these phases is challenging as they often exhibit overlapping boundaries, similar textures, and other more complexities that require a holistic understanding of the microstructures and correct phase representation within the image. To this end, we propose a novel approach for learning phase representations that captures the subtle differences between phases. Our proposed Phase Learning Module strategically integrates phase ratio information with image encodings to produce ratio-aware features that preserve critical spatial details. Materials scientists can roughly estimate phase ratios by examining an image, and our proposed model leverages this expertise. While we use expert-estimated phase ratios during inference, we train model using accurate phase ratios obtained from target mask images. To our knowledge, this is the first use of class ratios as input in a deep learning segmentation model that serves as constraints to guide consistent phase proportions in predictions. Experimental results demonstrate segmentation performance improvements on both private and public datasets, with our model achieving a 5.65% increase in Dice scores on the private dataset and a 6.48% improvement on the MetalDAM dataset. Furthermore, visualizations show that our approach leads to learning of more distinct and better phase representations across models. The code and private dataset will be made publicly available.",

                "value": "The author builds upon the existing SAM model and designs a new information fusion component called the Phase Learning Module. This module integrates additional information, such as phase ratio data, with image encodings to generate ratio-aware features that enhance segmentation performance. The author tested the model on both private and public datasets, achieving promising results. The application of artificial intelligence to explore less mature fields is commendable, and the author's commitment to making the code and datasets publicly available is beneficial to the field. However, the technical contribution of this work is insufficient for an ICLR paper and may be more suitable for a domain-specific journal."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main issue with this paper is the limited technical contribution. As an ICLR paper, the primary focus should be on the machine learning contribution, but this work mainly relies on fine-tuning SAM. While some technical designs, such as the phase ratio prompt, are introduced, these are clearly minor modifications of SAM, and there are already numerous similar methods. With proper revisions, this could potentially be a good AI for Science paper; however, the current technical contribution is not substantial enough for this problem, and it lacks significant insights for the ICLR audience. It may be more suitable for a domain-specific journal.\n\n2. Although the author claims that the Phase Learning Module is a technical contribution, there are some issues with its design and evaluation. The attempt to integrate external information into the SAM-based segmentation model for improved performance is commendable. However, the practical rationale and potential costs of this approach need thorough evaluation. During training, prompt information is derived from labels, but at the inference stage, acquiring additional information incurs costs. It is important to assess whether this additional cost is justified in real-world applications. Moreover, if the information is obtained from test labels, there is a risk of data leakage.\n\n3. Specific comparison and evaluation shortcomings:\n  \n    a. Fairness of Comparison: The author mainly compares basic segmentation models, but even these comparisons lack comprehensiveness. For example, segmentation models based on fundamental transformer architectures, such as TransUNet and UCTransNet, are not sufficiently evaluated. Furthermore, the model with external information is only compared against SAM, ignoring other deep learning models that focus on similar multimodal information fusion. This raises concerns about whether SAM\u2019s framework is necessary for multimodal fusion or if a simpler attention mechanism could achieve similar results.\n\n    b. Metric Selection: The author evaluates the segmentation model using only the Dice coefficient, which may not be sufficient or reliable. Other metrics, such as IoU, NSD, or those assessing boundary accuracy, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, the dataset size is not clearly discussed. If the dataset is small, cross-validation should be performed, and the mean and variance reported, along with statistical tests like a t-test to prove the effectiveness of the newly added module.\n\n    c. Parameter Comparison: Adding the new module likely increases the number of parameters. Comparing only performance without considering parameter count is not entirely fair. Moreover, the author does not compare different configurations of the SAM model (e.g., small, base, large versions), which should be addressed."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Refer to the discussion in the Weaknesses section. The experimental comparisons need to be more comprehensive, with a wider selection of evaluation metrics and more baselines (including both basic segmentation models and multimodal fusion models, not just SAM). Additionally, a detailed comparison of model parameters and inference speed is necessary. Extra manual experiments may also be needed to evaluate the practicality of acquiring prompt information."

The hidden region-size biases of segmentation losses.\n\nSecondly, as the approach requires expert-estimated phase ratios during inference, it falls into the category of interactive methods, necessitating a fair comparison with interactive approaches in terms of interaction time and final performance."

Instead of simply calculating it from the GT, predict it from the input and penalize using the GT ratio.
