    "title": "Interpretable Analysis and Reasoning Enhancement for LLMs via Cross-Generation Reasoning Trees",
    "abstract": "Generating diverse reasoning paths by varying the context (such as demonstrations, prompts, instructions, etc) or sampling methods (such as top-k, top-p, beam-search, etc) and then selecting appropriate paths via majority voting or verifier-based strategies to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is a commonly recognized approach. Although both different contexts and sampling techniques can generate diverse contents, using sampling methods alone does not significantly enhance the diversity of generations. Context variation, however, while fostering greater diversity in reasoning, can also introduce negative effects, which causes that switching contexts can not necessarily lead to proportional improvements in performance. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how context influences LLM generation and mitigate any adverse impacts. The primary challenge lies in the inability to conduct comparative studies once divergences occur in reasoning paths generated under different contexts. Specifically, once the predicted tokens at a given step differ, it becomes unclear whether subsequent tokens in the inference path are influenced by the context or the content already generated. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Generation Reasoning Tree (CGRT) algorithm for studying the impact of different contexts on LLM generation and enhancing LLMs' reasoning performance. Experimental findings reveal that, beyond enhancing interpretability, CGRT integrates the positive effects of both context and sampling strategies more effectively than previous approaches, leading to more rational inference paths. Experiments conducted on Llama2, Llama3, and Qwen demonstrate that, when generating an equivalent number of diverse inference paths, those produced via the \"reasoning tree\" method exhibit higher accuracy.",

                "value": "This paper introduces Cross-Generation Reasoning Tree (CGRT), an algorithm that constructs a token-level tree structure to analyze and improve LLM reasoning across different contexts (e.g., in-context demonstration or instruction etc.) and sampling methods. CGRT can analyze the impact of context (i.e., independent of generations) to the reasoning correctness of LLM responses, by structure a tree structure for the inference path. The authors also propose an inference version (iCGRT), which restricts the width of the tree by taking majority votes at each node (reduce to binary tree). The authors perform experiments on mathematically reasoning datasets, and they show that good reasoning path can lead to wrong results and bad reasoning path can lead to correct results. They also compare iCGRT with self-consistent method and show improvement."

It provides insight into how context influence the LLM reasoning path through the analysis of critical branching nodes. Also, it adapts the algorithm to an inference version, which shows improvement on previously baseline method (self-consistency)."

                "value": "1. Limited insights from the analysis. I appreciate the attempt of the authors to propose a new algorithm to analyze the impact of the context to reasoning path of LLMs, however, beyond the algorithm itself I don't see much new insights from the analysis.  For example, one main finding from the paper is \"good context can lead to incorrect answers and bad context can lead to correct answers,\", this is not new and has been revealed from previous work (e.g., [1]). I would like to see the authors do more in-depth analysis with their method. \n2. Lack of experiments. One of the main contribution claimed by the authors is the proposed methods leading to more accurate reasoning of LLMs, however, it is not well supported by the experiment:\n    - The paper only compares with self-consistency method, but doesn't compare with other state-of-the-art baselines such as Tree of Thoughts or Graph of Thoughts.\n    - The method improves over self-consistency (Table 2) but it is quite marginal (<=2%). Is that statistical significant? Even if so, how do we justify the significantly increased complexity introduced by the method (tree constructing and maintenance etc)? It is worth mentioning in the paper.\n    - If the claim is about improvement of reasoning correctness on the reasoning path, there is no evaluation results to verify whether the reasoning path quality has improved.\n3. I think the paper need improvement on the writing, here are a few examples:\n    - Long sequences in the paper are not easy to follow. For example, line 13-17 in the abstract;\n    - Fix the citation in line 62-64, and line 256.\n    - Figure 3, it is not clear what is the difference between 3 plots on the same row. I think caption should be added to emphasize that.\n    - As mentioned above, section 3.3 should be expanded to include more details, e.g., what metrics are used? How should we interpret the results?\n\nreference:\n[1] Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting"

                "value": "1. What will you do if the next token predicted by different context are evenly distributed (i.e., different)? This means low confidence from the model.

Also, this difficulty level is LLM dependent, are you doing the difficult classification per LLM?"

I'm not sure if the added complexity is worth the limited gains offered by iCGRT.\n\n- In order to show the effectiveness/generalizability of iCGRT, can the authors provide more experiments on harder tasks? e.g., MATH, and other types of reasoning tasks, like commonsense reasoning and Big-bench?\n\n- Can the authors provide ablation studies on the effect of n_s, n_p, S?
