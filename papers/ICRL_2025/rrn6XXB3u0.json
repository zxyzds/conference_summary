    "title": "Fast Few-Shot Graph Flow Prediction",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of traffic flow is crucial for optimizing transportation networks, mitigating congestion, and improving urban planning. However, existing approaches like graph neural networks (GNNs) and traffic simulations face challenges in predicting flow for unseen road networks without historical data. Without abundant training data, GNNs often generalize poorly to new graphs, while simulations can be computationally infeasible for large-scale networks. This paper tackles the problem of few-shot traffic flow prediction in unseen road networks. We propose a novel traffic simulation algorithm that efficiently predicts flow based on node and edge attributes. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our approach closely approximates true flow with asymptotically optimal runtime complexity. Experiments on real-world road networks show our simulation algorithm outperforms GNNs for predicting traffic in unseen cities after training on only three cities. While motivated by traffic prediction in road networks, we expect our contributions to have broader applicability to general graph flow prediction problems across domains.",

Why simulations can be computationally infeasible for large-scale networks?\n\nThe motivation is unclear. Why is it difficult for GCN to generalize to unseen graphs with limited viewpoints? As far as I know, GCN is a type of inductive learning method that relies on message passing mechanisms to generate representations for new nodes.\n\nThe writing of the article requires significant modifications. While the introduction emphasizes the generality of the proposed method, the experiments only focus on a specific case of traffic flow prediction. The general potential of the method is not well explained.\n\nThe paper introduces a traffic simulation method, but related work is missing, making it difficult for readers to understand the gaps in existing research.\n\nThe theory heavily relies on two assumptions. What empirical support do these assumptions have? Exploring a broader theoretical framework that applies to general scenarios would make the theory more robust.\n\nThe paper is difficult to understand and requires major revisions. I suggest the authors add section hints or summaries to explain what they have done.\n\nThe experiments are not sufficient, and there is a lack of discussion on advanced baselines, such as cross-city migration methods.\n\nThe content of the paper is not substantial. I recommend adding more experiments, such as visual experiments."

The approach combines road network attributes with a few-shot learning framework, aiming to provide accurate flow predictions on unseen city road networks. The main contributions include the use of node and edge attributes to simulate flow and a theoretical analysis suggesting an optimal runtime complexity. However, the paper poses several significant problems that undermine its contributions. The use of AADT as a prediction target limits the approach\u2019s applicability, as most traffic prediction studies focus on dynamic, real-time data that provide actionable insights for urban management. Additionally, the paper lacks adequate baseline comparisons, including only a single GNN model, which is insufficient for establishing superiority. The absence of common traffic datasets and unclear experimental details further weaken the study\u2019s rigor and reproducibility. These substantial gaps, along with unaddressed advancements in transfer learning for traffic prediction, leave the paper unconvincing in terms of practical relevance and scientific contribution."

For example, the main task is \"Graph Flow Prediction\", but the concept is rarely seen in general traffic prediction domain. As such, you must give a formal definition with necessary notations and equations to tell the reader what is \"Graph Flow Prediction\". Aside from that, you also need to formally define how you construct the traffic network graph in this research, What is the edge, what is the node, what are the node feature attributes, and how you calculate the element of graph adjacency matrix. Unfortunately, I don't see any formal preliminary definition in this article. The uncleared concepts make this paper hard to comprehend.\n\n\n\nAlthough the method introduced in this work seems technically sound, there are numerous fatal questions regarding the experiments, in fact your current experiments fail to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed simulation algorithm. See the following questions:\n\n**Q3: Why did you choose AADT as the prediction target?** Based on my understanding, most traffic simulation methods focus on predicting traffic flow for specific future time intervals (e.g., the next 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours). These approaches offer time-variant, dynamic predictions that provide real-time feedback and insights into urban traffic conditions, which are invaluable for traffic management. In contrast, this study targets AADT, a fixed annual average daily traffic value. Given that AADT represents only a single value per year, what is the rationale for using a traffic simulation algorithm for its prediction? It appears inefficient to collect extensive data, extract features, and build traffic graphs and neural network models if the outcome is only a static, annual statistical metric.\n\nQ4: Dataset statistics not clear. The three datasets you choose is not the widely recognized and open-sourced datasets in general traffic prediction domain. For instance, PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, METR-LA, PeMS-Bay, are commonly adopted datasets for traffic prediction and simulation.\n\n**Q5: The selection of baseline methods is clearly insufficient.** Comparing your proposed algorithm with only **one single GNN model** is inadequate to demonstrate its superiority. Typically, a comprehensive comparison includes at least 7 baseline methods, and many studies include even more. It is recommended to compare your approach with a broader range of GNN-based methods. If not with the latest state-of-the-art, you should at least include widely recognized baseline models from the past 3-4 years, such as DeepSTN+, ASTGCN[2], and AGCRN.
