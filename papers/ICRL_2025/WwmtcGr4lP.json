    "abstract": "Effective treatment of cancer is a major challenge faced by healthcare providers, due to the highly individualized nature of patient responses to treatment. This is caused by the heterogeneity seen in cancer-causing alterations (mutations) across patient genomes. Limited availability of response data in patients makes it difficult to train personalized treatment recommendation models on mutations from clinical genomic sequencing reports. Prior methods tackle this by utilising larger, labelled pre-clinical laboratory datasets (\u2018cell lines\u2019), via transfer learning. These methods augment patient data by learning a shared, domain-invariant representation, between the cell line and patient domains, which is then used to train a downstream drug response prediction (DRP) model. This approach augments data in the shared space but fails to model patient-specific characteristics, which have a strong influence on their drug response. We propose a novel generative attention-based data augmentation and predictive modeling framework, GANDALF, to tackle this crucial shortcoming of prior methods. GANDALF not only augments patient genomic data directly, but also accounts for its domain-specific characteristics. GANDALF outperforms state-of-the-art DRP models on publicly available patient datasets and emerges as the front-runner amongst SOTA cancer DRP models.",

The paper needs to demonstrate results across a more diverse set of drug classes and provide statistical tests showing whether performance advantages hold across the full drug set. \n\n- The authors state \"we do drug-specific model tuning in GANDALF, by only augmenting with sample, drug pairs for the drug considered.\" This approach may cause extensive computational burden, as it requires fine-tuning for each new drug, potentially limiting its practical deployment.\n\n- The paper does not address how well GANDALF generalizes to novel drugs in out-of-domain scenarios\u2014a critical consideration given that new drugs are regularly introduced into clinical practice.\n\n- Though the paper deals with the challenge of limited patient data, it doesn't systematically analyze how performance varies with different amounts of training data.

For example, the authors state, \"to ease training, we reduce the dimensionality \u2026 using variational autoencoders (VAEs),\u201d but it is unclear why a VAE is required rather than a simpler embedding without a decoder and what specific role the VAE\u2019s decoder serves. While VAEs are known for capturing latent features and supporting generative tasks, considering that DDPM is an autoencoder-structured generative model, the need for a secondary, nested autoencoder is not well justified. This makes the model more complicated. The authors are needed to address the following points; 1. why a simpler embedding without a decoder is insufficient in this context; 2. what the specific function of the VAE's decoder plays in the model's architecture; 3. how the combination of VAEs and DDPM provides benefits that DDPM alone does not.\n\n- How is the time step $t$ defined? Does it mean the time after treatment? This should be clarified in the problem formulation section. Additionally, how is $\\beta_t$ set?\n\n- How are the ground truth noise distributions $e_c, e_p$ defined, and how does the DDPM decoder remove domain-specific noise?\n\n- In the results section, only five drugs are reported out of about 100 test drugs. The criteria for selecting these specific drugs should be clarified, especially given that all drugs were included in the ablation study.\n\n- The study should assess the model\u2019s ability to accurately label mutation-drug pairs when the drug in question is absent from the labeled training dataset (X_p, y_p, d_p). Were these five drugs excluded from the training and validation sets? If they were, a comparative analysis of model performance on drugs within and outside the training set would enhance the understanding of the model\u2019s generalizability; if not, this experiment does not adequately validate the model\u2019s intended benefits.\n\n- There are typos in Equation (6), specifically where L_MSE is indicated as L_R and L_KLDV as L_KLD?"

How were they selected and how did you ensure that equal hyperparameter search time was dedicated to your model and baselines?\n\n- It\u2019s very hard to compare the ablation results in table 2 to table 1.

For example, looking at only the top 2 principal components in high dimensional data to compare variance does not seem correct as you might be ignoring a ton of the signal.

What makes GANDALF capable of handling shifts like that?\n\n- Although authors have provided the source code, critical information is missing with respect to reproducibility of this work. For example, it is unclear if the reported numbers are from how many independent runs or hyper-parameters and the procedure for tuning them are not reported in the paper for any of the components e.g., DDPA, transformers, VAE, MTL, etc. \n\n- Citations of the utilized data are inaccurate and incomplete. For example, for CCLE and GDSC the seminal work like \n\u201cBarretina et al., The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity 2012\u201d or \u201cIorio et al. A Landscape of Pharmacogenomic Interactions in Cancer 2016\u201d are not cited. Moreover, Although authors claimed that they\u2019ve used GDSCv2, the citation is for 2012 which is more correlated with GDSCv1 timeline. Is this a citation error or GDSCv1 was used? \n\n- Authors used genomic data from CCLE and response data from GDSC, there is no justification for why the response profiles of these datasets are interchangeable. How many cell lines were in common between CCLE and GDSC, was the drug screening assay comparable between the two? this is important because GDSCv1 used Syto60 assay while CCLE and GDSCv2 used CellTiter-Glo (going back to the previous point on which GDSC was used).  \n\n- There are parts of the paper that is challenging to follow for example, \u201cWe had a total of 156441 train, 17371 validation and 21589 test cell line, drug pairs. We also had 488/488/487 train, 53/54/56 validation and 115/114/113 test patient, drug pairs over the 3 folds.\u201d Is unclear to me. Is this a reference to different patient data sources? \n\n- W/o MTL in ablation seems misleading as it only removes the cell line part but the proper way of doing this is to replace it with a drug specific single task model train on both cell lines and patients. \n\n- Another missing ablation is w/o diffusion what happens if you apply VAE directly to the input data?\n\n- GANDALF learning curve is missing in Figure 7"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- There is no information regarding the applicability domain of GANDAL including what types of cancers was this method train/evaluated on? What was the performance per cancer type? similarly for cell lines, was the data from only solid tumours or both solid and non-solid tumours? \n\n- While somatic mutations can be predictive of drug response, other available data types such as RNA-Seq make more accurate predictions. To my knowledge, CCLE/GDSCv2 and TCGA/CbioPortal also have gene expression data, if the ultimate goal is to assist clinicians with choice of therapy why did you choose not to use other data types? \n\n- Why is GANDALF only applicable to chemotherapy drugs? Mutation data is also predictive of targeted therapeutics I can imagine it could be due to lack of labeled data for targeted drugs if so, isn\u2019t this a huge disadvantage for the proposed method that requires labeled patient data as input? For targeted drugs like Erlotinib (Byers et al. An Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Signature Predicts Resistance to EGFR and PI3K Inhibitors and Identifies Axl as a Therapeutic Target for Overcoming EGFR Inhibitor Resistance 2013) there are many labeled cell lines and smaller labeled patient data. Do you have any sense on the minimum required number of cell lines and patient samples for your method? I believe an experiment of percentage of labeled samples would be highly beneficial.  \n\n- The reported performance for WISER and Code-AE in this work are substantially lower than those reported in the original papers for similar drugs and datasets. It seems WISER and Code-AE had a similar setup so what\u2019s the difference between your setup and their\u2019s? \n\nI'd be happy to revise my score if authors answer all questions/concerns thoroughly particularly:\n- potential data issue\n- applicability domain\n- reproducibility \n- missing ablations"
