    "title": "Object-aware Conditional Alignment for Cross-domain Counting",
    "abstract": "Object counting is an important task in computer vision with many real-world applications. In practical settings, factors such as lighting conditions and object density can vary dramatically, leading to distribution shifts then causing inaccurate counting. We found that existing domain adaptation (DA) methods cannot be directly applied to the counting task, as they usually assume changes across different domains are task-irrelevant and focus on utilizing domain-invariant features for prediction. However, in object counting tasks, changes in object density which could happen across domains are task-relevant and cannot be ignored. Therefore, applying existing DA methods to the counting task can ignore the information about density changes, resulting in unreliable counting. To address this limitation, we propose the Binary Alignment Network (BiAN). Unlike traditional DA methods that align distributions of entire image representations, BiAN segments objects of interest and aligns the distributions of the object-specific features across domains. This targeted alignment allows us to disregard irrelevant features, such as lighting conditions, while preserving essential information about changes in object density. We theoretically demonstrate that BiAN achieves superior adaptability in counting tasks by introducing conditional alignment\u2014aligning features conditioned on the presence of objects. Extensive experiments on two distinct counting tasks and eight dataset combinations show that BiAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

The introduction of conditional alignment and conditional consistency mechanisms effectively addresses task-related factors such as object density changes, leading to improved counting accuracy.\n2. The authors offer a detailed theoretical analysis, proving that BiAN achieves a lower bound on joint decision error. This analysis illustrates how conditional alignment contributes to error reduction, thereby providing strong theoretical support for the method\u2019s effectiveness.\n3. The authors achieved significant performance improvements."

As the authors state, they only align feature distributions of objects of interest so that inter-subject information can be preserved. The authors need to provide more ablation experiments and analysis to ensure that the improvement in experimental results comes from retaining the target feature distribution.\n2. In Tables 6-8, the author provides detailed structures and parameters. The author should consider adding network visualization.\n3. The method proposed by the author is universal for the problem of domain adaptation learning. Does the author consider multi-task verification on other tasks?\n4. This paper needs to be improved. For example, many quotation signs are wrong in sec. 4.1."

(1)? How is it implemented during training?\n- In line 181, is the subscript correct to denote $z_{\\text{inv}}$ and $z_{\\text{var}}$ as the domain-invariant and domain-variant features?\n- In line 234, why can $f_c \\in F$ share weights with $F$? Since $f_c$ is an element of $F$, how does it share weights? What does $F$ mean, and what are its weights?\n- In line 206, $x$ is segmented into partitions $x_i$, and then divided into conditional subsets $x_{ij}^c$. In line 208, $x_i = \\cup_{j=1}^k x_{ij}^c$. This part is confusing. What is the relationship between $x_{ij}$ and $x_i$? Is there any plot demonstrating the relationship between them? What is the meaning of $j$ here?\n- What are $\\hat{c}_s$, $\\hat{c}_s^f$, and $\\hat{c}_s^b$ in Eq. (6)? $\\hat{c}$ is not mentioned in any part except Eq.

Is there any description explaining its meaning?\n- Are there any results on adaptation from Shanghai Tech Part A/B to UCF-QNRF?\n- The results presented in Table 5 are confusing. Do you use labels in the test set of the UCF-QNRF dataset? It does not make sense to obtain a DA model achieving much better results than a model fully supervised with real data (STEERER). Similar results are also observed in Table 2. BiAN's MAE (42.3) is much better than the current SOTA (STEERER: 54.5 or PET: 49.34). Implementation details should be provided for reference."

Additionally, how do we metric the extent of the density change?\n- It\u2019s unclear how segmentation is achieved in the BiAN framework. For instance, is a pre-trained model used for segmentation, or is this achieved through training within the framework?\n- L372-373: The phrase \"As to the evaluation metrics, we follow the previous works' setting\" is followed by a similar statement: \"Following the previous research works.\"\nThe wrong best value indicated in Table 1: the SD\u2192SR MAE and SN\u2192FH MSE.\n- Missing necessary symbols in the figures. e.g., in Fig.1, the purple feature refers to the source domain, while the green feature refers to the target domain.
