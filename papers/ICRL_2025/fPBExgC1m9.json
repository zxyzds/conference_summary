    "title": "Leveraging Natural Frequency Deviation for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but the generated high-quality images raise concerns about potential malicious use. Existing detectors often struggle to capture distinctive features across different training models, limiting their generalization to unseen diffusion models with varying schedulers and hyperparameters. To address this issue, we observe that diffusion-generated images exhibit progressively larger differences from real images across low- to high-frequency bands. Based on this insight, we propose a novel image representation called \\textbf{N}atural \\textbf{F}r\\textbf{e}quency \\textbf{De}viation~(\\textbf{DEFEND}). DEFEND applies a weighted filter to the Fourier spectrum, suppressing less discriminative bands while enhancing more informative ones. This approach, grounded in a comprehensive analysis of frequency-based differences between real and diffusion-generated images, enables robust detection of images from unseen diffusion models and provides resilience to various perturbations. Extensive experiments on diffusion-generated image datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art detectors with superior generalization and robustness.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a synthetic image detection method with frequency analysis, based on the discrepancy of the high-frequency components of real and synthetic images. According to the motivating power spectrum analysis, the synthetic images (generated with diffusion models) under-represent high frequency components compared to real images, especially in low-noise regime (last steps in diffusion generation). The paper points out this phenomenon, and this is caused in the same manner that the likelihood-maximizing loss function for diffusion model do not work prominently for high-fidelity image synthesis.\nThe detection method is as follows: first, after sampling from the pre-trained diffusion model, the paper first measures the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of gray-scaled natural/diffusion-generated images then compare the mean discrepancy in terms of power spectrum in the dataset. Then with the designed weight (focuses in high frequency) multiplicated with the frequency components is considered as the classifier (detector) input. In various image datasets, the proposed method achieves almost perfect performance, while existing works does not."

                "value": "1. The main idea of the paper is not novel. Overall, utilizing the frequency domain for deepfake detection (especially in the high-frequency component) has been exhaustively explored. Although the authors put a lot of effort into explaining the power spectrum and the design, the final form of Equation (4) shares similarities with previous papers that utilize frequency domain representation (to cite a few, [1~4]). Furthermore, the idea of applying the power spectrum analysis for deepfake detection has been introduced in previous literature ([5]). \n\n2. Connected to 1., the paper proposes a weighted filter as a main difference compared to existing frequency-based methods. The main difference is the pre-defined quadratic weight and threshold in Equation (10), which seems to be set \"Empirically\". I do not find any meaningful justification for the choice. Hence, no justification for the benefit of the proposed method is introduced, and it is hard to understand why this method works.\n\n3. However, all of a sudden, the result in this paper is near-perfect. It is hard to understand why introducing quadratic frequency weighting term nearly solves the challenging benchmarks while previous methods that engineer the weighting function by learning (e.g. [1]) do not. Given that there is no code available, the results in this paper do not satisfy my concerns. \n\n4. I also find the experiment setting is distant from common practices. For example, the GenImage benchmark usually trains on the ImageNet training dataset and SDv1.4-generated images. This paper trains on ADM images for AI-generated images. It is hard to compare the results reported in this paper to the other papers, which further hinders resolving my concerns about the experiment results. \n\n5) While this seems relatively minor, I do not concur with the author's proposition in related works in L130-132. I think the existing works also take account of the distribution of the real images since they train their classifiers on the real data's frequency representation. \n\n\nOverall, I feel the idea of the paper is dated and the methodology shares similarities to various existing works. The only difference is the quadratic weight, and I do not understand why this difference should critically work. Given that, I find it hard to understand why the reported results show near-perfect performance."

What's the performance in the GenImage dataset when SDv1.4 is used for training?\n\n4. Why the BigGAN dataset is excluded?
