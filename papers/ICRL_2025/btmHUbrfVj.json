    "abstract": "Self-supervised contrastive learning models, such as CLIP, have set new benchmarks for vision-language models in many downstream tasks. However, their dependency on rigid one-to-one mappings overlooks the complex and often multifaceted relationships between and within texts and images. To this end, we introduce RankCLIP, a novel pretraining method that extends beyond the rigid one-to-one matching framework of CLIP and its variants. By extending the traditional pair-wise loss to list-wise, and leveraging both in-modal and cross-modal ranking consistency, RankCLIP improves the alignment process, enabling it to capture the nuanced many-to-many relationships between and within each modality. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RankCLIP in various downstream tasks, notably achieving significant gains in zero-shot classifications over state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the importance of this enhanced learning process.",

                "value": "The paper presents RANKCLIP, a vision-language pretraining method that enhances the alignment between visual and textual modalities. It shifts from traditional pair-wise loss to a list-wise approach, allowing the model to capture many-to-many relationships. RANKCLIP introduces a ranking consistency mechanism to optimize similarity levels within and across modalities. This approach helps the model learn nuanced relationships, such as the closeness between similar images and texts. By leveraging secondary similarities among unmatched pairs, RANKCLIP improves learning efficiency without needing extra data or resources. Comprehensive experiments demostrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in downstream tasks, particularly in zero-shot classification and retrieval accuracy."

For example, [1] proposed a progressive self-distillation method that uses image-to-text logits (and vice versa) as targets, while [2] introduced in-modal consistency.\n\n- Lack of Novelty: RANKCLIP closely resembles the method described in [1], raising questions about its novelty.\n\n- Misaligned Experiment Settings: The experimental setup is misaligned, making the results less convincing. While many CLIP-related works utilize the ViT-B/32 architecture as the vision backbone, RANKCLIP employs RN50, which could affect the comparability of the results.\n\n- Performance Downgrade in Linear Probe Classification: The proposed method underperforms in linear probe classification on fine-grained datasets, such as GVGAircraft, Food101, and GTSRB. The paper does not address this phenomenon, which limits the interpretation of its effectiveness.\n\n- Unconvincing Results in Zero-Shot Text/Image Retrieval: There is a substantial disparity between the results of image retrieval and text retrieval (84.1% vs. 8.1%), which raises doubts about the reliability of these findings.\n\n\n[1] Andonian, Alex, Shixing Chen, and Raffay Hamid. \"Robust cross-modal representation learning with progressive self-distillation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n[2] Goel, Shashank, et al. \"Cyclip: Cyclic contrastive language-image pretraining.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 6704-6719."

While embedding-level correlations between similar samples are known to emerge naturally from this approach, no method to date has directly leveraged this correlation. The proposed rank consistency loss effectively utilizes this inherent similarity, potentially improving the overall quality of the learned embeddings.\n\n- **Improvement and Scalability in Embedding Quality**: Consistent improvements in embedding quality are observed across various benchmarks. Notably, the gains become more pronounced as training dataset sizes increase (e.g., from CIFAR to ImageNet to YFCC), indicating promising scalability with larger datasets."

                "value": "- **Integration with the Original CLIP Objective**: While the method improves experimental results, further analysis could clarify how the proposed rank consistency objective interacts with the original CLIP objective. For instance, it would be helpful to understand the balance between the two objectives, or if the rank consistency objective alone could effectively learn cross-modal alignment embeddings. This discussion is currently lacking.\n\n- **Limited Ablation Study on Loss Components**: The ablation study on the loss components appears insufficient. Table 5 shows that cross-modal consistency alone performs close to the combined objectives, suggesting that in-modal consistency may have limited impact. This raises questions about whether in-modal consistency is essential, or if the CLIP objective could also benefit from in-modality instance discrimination. \n\n- **Limited comparison with other CLIP modifications**: The paper compares with ALIP and CLIP in experiments. However, there are other recent works on improving the CLIP objective, such as SigLIP,. It is a bit difficult to justify the significance of the quality improvement introduced by the method without comparison with the recent methods and analysis of the comparison results. \n\nOverall, the complementarity between rank consistency and the CLIP objective could be explored further, as it may offer insights beyond the experimental improvements presented. Stopping at the observed gains may overlook a deeper understanding of the method\u2019s theoretical and practical value."
