    "title": "Leveraging Semantic and Positional Uncertainty for Trajectory Prediction",
    "abstract": "Given a time horizon with historical movement data and environmental context, trajectory prediction aims to forecast the future motion of dynamic entities, such as vehicles and pedestrians. A key challenge in this task arises from the dynamic and noisy nature of real-time maps. This noise primarily stems from two resources: (1) positional errors due to sensor inaccuracies or environmental occlusions, and (2) cognitive errors resulting from incorrect scene understanding. \nIn an attempt to solve this problem, we propose a new framework that estimates two kinds of uncertainty, \\ie, positional uncertainty and semantic uncertainty simultaneously, and explicitly incorporates both uncertainties into the trajectory prediction process. \nIn particular, we introduce a dual-head structure to independently perform semantic prediction twice and positional prediction twice, and further extract the prediction variance as the uncertainty indicator in an end-to-end manner. The uncertainty is then directly concatenated with the semantic and positional predictions to enhance the trajectory estimation.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware approach, we evaluate it on the real-world driving dataset, \\ie, nuScenes. \nExtensive experiments on 3 mapping estimation and 2 trajectory approaches show that the proposed method (1) effectively captures map noise through both positional and semantic uncertainties, and (2) seamlessly integrates and enhances existing trajectory prediction methods on multiple evaluation metrics, \\ie, minADE, minFDE, and MR.",

                "value": "This article introduces a novel framework for trajectory prediction that addresses the challenges posed by real-time map noise resulting from sensor inaccuracies, misinterpretations, and other factors. The proposed method estimates both positional and semantic uncertainties, integrating them into the prediction process through a dual-head structure that performs independent predictions and extracts prediction variance as an indicator of uncertainty. Validated on the nuScenes dataset, this approach effectively captures map noise and enhances existing trajectory prediction methods."

Additionally, the figures and charts adhere to established standards, which is commendable.\n\n2. This paper addresses two types of uncertainties: positional and semantic. It aims to mitigate the adverse effects of noise in High-Definition (HD) map estimation for trajectory prediction.\n\n3. By integrating map elements that include both positional and semantic uncertainties into downstream models, this approach leverages the context of uncertainty to improve the accuracy of trajectory predictions.\n\n4. The method can be integrated with existing mapping estimation and trajectory prediction approaches, consistently enhancing prediction accuracy. This is evidenced by significant improvements in minADE, minFDE, and MR on the nuScenes dataset when combined with specific backbone models."

Although the authors have conducted numerous experiments and analyses, which is commendable, there is still an opportunity to expand the experiments further to enhance the credibility of the work. For instance, the authors could consider referencing some of the latest research in online mapping or trajectory prediction, such as:\n\n    [1] MapTracker: Tracking with Strided Memory Fusion for Consistent Vector HD Mapping\n\n    [2] MGMap: Mask-Guided Learning for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction\n\n    [3] MapDistill: Boosting Efficient Camera-based HD Map Construction via Camera-LiDAR Fusion Model Distillation\n\n    [4] Producing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction\n\n    [5] Accelerating Online Mapping and Behavior Prediction via Direct BEV Feature Attention\n\n2. In future work, it is suggested that the authors attempt to explore research based on scene topology reasoning, such as:\n    [1] TopoNet: A New Baseline for Scene Topology Reasoning"
