    "title": "MolStitch: Offline Multi-Objective Molecular Optimization with Molecular Stitching",
    "abstract": "Molecular discovery is essential for advancing various scientific fields by generating novel molecules with desirable properties. This process is naturally a multi-objective optimization problem, as it must balance multiple molecular properties simultaneously. Although numerous methods have been developed to address this problem, most rely on online settings that repeatedly evaluate candidate molecules through oracle queries. However, in practical applications, online settings may not be feasible due to the extensive time and resources required for each oracle query. To fill this gap, we propose the Molecular Stitching (MolStitch) framework, which utilizes a fixed offline dataset to explore and optimize molecules without the need for repeated oracle queries. Specifically, MolStitch leverages existing molecules from the offline dataset to generate novel `stitched molecules' that combine their desirable properties. These stitched molecules are then used as training samples to fine-tune the generative model, enhancing its ability to produce superior molecules beyond those in the offline dataset. Experimental results on various offline multi-objective molecular optimization problems validate the effectiveness of MolStitch. MolStitch has been thoroughly analyzed, and its source code is available online.",

                "value": "This work introduces MolStitch as an approach to molecular design that uses a fixed offline dataset to design \u201cstitched molecules\u201d; this is in contrast to the more common iterative molecular optimization approaches that are able to query an oracle. The approach is inspired from trajectory stitching in offline RL. Generated molecules are scored by a proxy model trained to perform pairwise ranking of molecules\u2019 optimalities defined by a scalarized property score. Scalarization weights are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution to achieve diversity along a Pareto front."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The method that seems central to MolStitch---to stich two molecules together and generate a new structure that combines substructures of each---is equivalent to a standard crossover operation in molecular optimization. Indeed, the authors pretrain their model using the rule-based crossover from Jensen\u2019s GraphGA/GraphMCTS. A comparison to a GraphGA employing crossover operations and otherwise using the same ranking proxy model (e.g., for binary tournament selection) is not included.\n\nHowever, the examples in Figure 17 suggest that the generative model, when proposing newly \u201cstitched\u201d molecules, pays very little attention to the two parent molecules. For me, this calls into question the entire premise of \u201cstitching\u201d as opposed to direct optimization of a generative model given a ranking proxy model. Even if the generative model is pretrained on the results of crossover operations, the stitched molecules here have extraordinarily little resemblance to the parent molecules.\n\nThe ablation in Table 3 suggests that the rank-based proxy is critical to performance, yet the other ablations and comparisons seem to lack evaluations using the rank-based proxy in combination with other generative methods besides REINVENT, including a GraphGA as mentioned earlier. Overall, the ablations still leave a murky impression of what aspects of MolStitch represent the most significant improvement over prior work. \n\nRelatively simple concepts for a venue such as ICLR are explained in unnecessary detail. For example, the form of a Dirichlet distribution, a 2-norm regression loss, Pareto optimality, pairwise ranking in Equation 13, and autoregressive token generation. Generic inequality and equality constraints in Equation 1 do not seem to serve a role in the example applications.\n\n[not a score-driving weakness] Proxy model training focuses on pairwise ranking and is initially trained on unlabeled molecules under the assumption that high structural similarity (above a threshold $\\delta$) implies that the objective scores of an unlabeled molecule should match that of the original molecule. Imposing this assumption can be accomplished through means besides pretraining (e.g., use of a Tanimoto kernel in a GP proxy model trained on the original regression task, or simple data augmentation for any proxy model). There is not specific justification for this particular approach, but the empirical results are strong.\n\n[not a score-driving weakness] There is no Related Work section in the *main text* of the manuscript. \n\n[not a score-driving weakness] As a minor point regarding Appendix B.2, Bayesian optimization and scalarization are not mutually exclusive."

                "value": "The comparisons in Table 1 and 2 focus on the hypervolume; it is not clear how the multi-objective nature of the task is being considered here. The potential contributions of MolStitch related to its generative approach is distinct from its potential contributions related to sampling diverse scalarization weights. How is scalarization handled for the baseline methods included in this comparison? \n\nMolStitch is not a method that needs to be applied in a multi-objective context, fundamentally. Have benchmarks been performed on single objective tasks or multi-objective tasks with fixed scalarization weights using performance metrics other than HV? For example, the same top-10 AUC in PMO where some tasks were derived?\n\n(My questions and stated weaknesses are an attempt to clarify the contributions made by this work; there are many combinations of modelling choices that are possible, and despite the inclusion of ablations, my impression is that the rank-based proxy is the largest contributor to performance. Taking this component and integrating it with other modelling choices would help verify or refute this. I acknowledge the empirical results are very strong.)"

The article is clearly written to explain the method, and I can easily understand how each module works.\n\n3. The authors have considered the multi-objective challenge in MOMO. In fact, I agree that this is not an issue that should be ignored because there are too many phenomena in molecular properties that cannot be balanced due to natural conflicts. The existing MOMO methods can just complete this task, but does not consider or solve the problems brought about by multiple objectives."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper is not very well written. For example, especially in the introduction, I understand the importance of reducing the number of oracle queries, but what is the relationship with the performance of the proxy model that is introduced at great length? In other words, why does low proxy accuracy increase the number of oracle queries? In fact, online oracle calls are not absolutely related to the performance of the proxy model. For example, in DST[1], the proxy model is sufficient to support effective functional group editing. However, due to the limitations of its formulation, DST still needs an oracle to screen and obtain the optimal and more detailed connections between atoms. \n\n2. Motivation is good, but the proposed method does not fit well with motivation. I personally think that the number of oracle queries should take into account the labeled dataset and online generation. Some methods don't need the former, and some don't need the latter. The two parts should not be treated too differently. For example, if a method requires rdkit's online query but it can achieve effective MOMO, why not? If the author can show that the proposed method has an absolute advantage in the evaluation of the sum of the oracle query times of the two parts, then I agree. If plan to do this, please consider adding the oracle query times of the two parts of all baselines. Also, please note that LigGPT[2] also does not need to call oracle in the latter (please correct me if I am wrong).\n\n3. I am very grateful that the author pays attention to the multi-objective problem in MOMO, which is ignored by most baselines. This is because multi-objective optimization itself is a huge challenge. MOMO needs to consider not only the optimization itself, but also how to balance multiple objectives. Although this paper adopts the Pareto solution, this problem has not been analyzed in detail, which is regrettable for the MOMO field. Frankly speaking, this is not a factor I consider when scoring, but I really hope that the author will add some necessary analysis. For example, do the molecules have natural property conflicts? And will MOMO cause gradient conflicts during the optimization process (for specific implementation methods, please refer to [3]). Of course, has the property conflict problem been resolved before and after Pareto was adopted?\n\n4. About experiments. In my opinion, the authors unnecessarily restricted their experiments to offline optimization baselines, as they are not commonly found in MOMO tasks. For example, the ICT method does not seem to be designed for molecules. I suggest the authors add all the baselines mentioned in the DST paper and report the respective numbers of oracle calls during two stages required for all baselines. I would like to see whether the method in this paper has a clear advantage in the number of queries in both stages. Authors should consider reporting average property score (APS), which is a commonly used metric in the MOMO community.\n\n\n[1] Differentiable Scaffolding Tree for Molecular Optimization.
