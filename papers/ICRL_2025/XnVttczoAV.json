    "title": "Beyond Circuit Connections: A Non-Message Passing Graph Transformer Approach for Quantum Error Mitigation",
    "abstract": "Despite the progress in quantum computing, one major bottleneck against the practical utility is its susceptibility to noise, which frequently occurs in current quantum systems. Existing quantum error mitigation (QEM) methods either lack generality to noise and circuit types or fail to capture the global dependencies of entire systems in addition to circuit structure. In this work, we first propose a unique circuit-to-graph encoding scheme with qubit-wise noisy measurement aggregated. Then, we introduce GTraQEM, a non-message passing graph transformer designed to effectively mitigate errors in expected circuit measurement outcomes. GTraQEM are equipped with a quantum-specific positional encoding, a structure matrix as attention bias guiding nonlocal aggregation, and a virtual quantum-representative node to further grasp graph representations, which guarantees to model the long-range entanglement. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GTraQEM outperforms state-of-the-art QEM methods on both random and structured quantum circuits across noise types and scales among diverse settings.",

While it\u2019s pretty straightforward, their approach works better than other GNN-based quantum error mitigation methods that I\u2019ve seen.\n   - Pretty good results on simulated data. While a lot of the error bars overlap, the new method regularly outperforms competitors on many of the toy error models."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Weaknesses:\n   - Lots of misleading or slightly incorrect claims in the background section. See below.\n   - Simulations leave a fair bit to be desired. In particular, they don\u2019t use any error models with coherent errors, which are particularly pernicious kinds of errors because they\u2019re effects depend intimately on the unitary implemented by a quantum circuit (e.g., coherent errors can cancel). The IBM fake providers use an error model that models gate errors as a depolarizing channel followed by thermal relaxation (T1 decoherence). Their incoherence-only error model only features depolarizing noise, which is probably the easiest to mitigate\n   - No head-to-head comparisons on experimental data: They ran 50-qubit circuits on IBM Brisbane but then didn\u2019t compare their new approach to other methods (if they did, I\u2019m sorry! I missed it in the paper).\n\nMiscellaneous remarks:\n   - The circuit-to-DAG encoding (or a very similar encoding) used in this paper was used earlier in this paper: \u201cQuEst: Graph Transformer for Quantum Circuit Reliability Estimation.\u201d You should cite it.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the misleading claims in the paper: \n   - \u201cQuantum Error Correction (QEC) (Calderbank & Shor, 1996; Gottesman, 1997; Terhal, 2015) first offers a theoretical solution by fully correcting quantum errors at the hardware level, but its implementation demands impractically qubit overheads and complex operations (Cai et al., 2023).\u201d I don\u2019t think that QEC corrects errors at the hardware level. Most QEC protocols (e.g., quantum error correcting codes) require syndrome data to be extracted and then processed by a classical co-processor. The quantum state is then adaptively updated (at least when running a circuit that uses a universal gate set) in response to the results of the syndrome data analysis. I\u2019d change this statement to better reflect how QEC works.\n     I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that QEC is \u201cimpractical.\u201d Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation is certainly currently infeasible, but lots of teams are working on making it a reality! I\u2019d re-phrase this to say that large-scale fault-tolerance quantum computation is currently well beyond the capabilities of our experimental hardware. \n   - \u201c Overall, QEM provides a feasible approach to enable imperfect quantum systems to produce reliable outcomes (Kandala et al., 2019; Bravyi et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2023), which is crucial for achieving practical quantum supremacy over classical supercomputers (Daley et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023).\u201d So, most quantum error mitigation methods also have an exponential-in-the-qubit-count overhead. So it\u2019s not clear if they\u2019ll offer a path to quantum computational supremacy. Past works, such as in the Kim et. Al. Paper, have only shown hints at quantum advantage, which is a much weaker claim. This sentence should be rewritten to reflect this.\n   - \u201c Machine learning-based QEM methods have recently been developed, offering greater generality across various settings.\u201d This claim is questionable and requires citations. \n   - \u201c Bell nonlocality (Bell, 1964; Brunner et al., 2014) demonstrates that entangled particles exhibit correlations where the measurement outcome of one particle instantaneously influences that of another, regardless of the distance between them.\u201d This is not an accurate description of Bell nonlocality. Entanglement does not allow particles to influence each other at a distance. No information is transmitted. Instead Bell nonlocality allows for measurement distributions with non-classical correlations. \n   - \u201c We introduce a data augmentation technique that constructs training data by composing circuits with their inverse circuits.\u201d Composing circuits with their inverses in order to (ideally) create the identity circuit is not a new idea. It underpins almost all randomized benchmarking algorithms (Clifford RB, Magann et. Al.). You should at least mention this.\n   - Section 2.2 gives a very non-standard overview of the noise sources in quantum computers. For instance, I\u2019ve never heard anyone use the term \u201creal quantum device errors\u201d before. I would re-write the section to first talk about Markovian vs. non-Markovian errors, then step through the differences between the kinds of Markovian errors a device can experience: incoherent/stochastic errors, coherent errors, and \u201cother errors\u201d like amplitude damping (see \u201cA Taxonomy of Small Markovian Errors\u201d). N.B. I\u2019m pretty sure that all quantum error channels also have a Kraus decomposition (this is not clear from your claim in A.7.1 when you state that incoherent errors have a Kraus decomposition)."

While the authors compare GTraQEM with learning- or ML-based QEM approaches, showing many promising results, classical QEM methods such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation, Symmetry Constraints, and Purity Constraints are not included in the experimental comparisons or discussed anywhere in the paper.\n2. The authors clearly demonstrate that GTraQEM can achieve better performance in noise calibration compared to learning- or ML-based QEM methods. However, they do not compare the overheads of these methods, which is crucial for evaluating QEM methods.\n3. I am concerned about the scalability of GTraQEM due to its reliance on edge features that require expectation measurements. As quantum circuits grow in size and complexity, the need for extensive measurements could result in significant resource demands, potentially limiting the applicability of GTraQEM for larger quantum systems or more complex circuits.\n4.

Because QEM is an area that is mainly based on experimental/numerical evidence, it is vital to clarify the methods and the settings when the authors do not provide any codes.\n\nIn my opinion, the results shown in the figures and tables are not that convincing for me. For example, In Fig. 3, the results show that ZNE does not have any effect in all experiments. This clearly contradicts with the famous known results such as [Nature volume 618, pages500\u2013505 (2023)], which also applies the transverse-field Ising model and trotterisation. \n\n2. The paper writing needs to be strengthened. For example, the 15-qubit circuits experiment in Table 2 seem to be confusing. Why do we need this?\n\n3. Figure 3 is unclear. I can hardly recognize the color.\n\n4. There are many typos. For example, 6 qubit should be 6-qubit (in Fig. 3), and the \nbroken sentence in line 408.\n\n5. The limitations of the proposed approach should be discussed, including the extra cost caused by the acquisition of the training set, and the cost of the training process."

The original data/code generated by this paper should be provided to improve reproducibility. Also, there should be an explanation about why ZNE does not have any effect in Fig. 3 and Table 1.\n\n2. The y-axis in Fig. 4 is the absolute error of EV. However, panel (f) implies there is some distribution over 2.0. In fact, it should be always in the range [0,2] (considering the observable should be within [-1,1]). \n\n3. Whether the type of the circuit matter in GTraQEM? How is the generalizability of the method?\n\n4. As this paper uses an IBM's quantum computer (Brisbane), it is recommended to articulate the hardware's physical parameters to improve the soundness, e.g. the topology (including the 50 used qubits), the coherence time, the single-qubit and two-qubit fidelities during the experiment."
