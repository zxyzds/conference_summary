    "title": "ProtoSnap: Prototype Alignment For Cuneiform Signs",
    "abstract": "The cuneiform writing system served as the medium for transmitting knowledge\nin the ancient Near East for a period of over three thousand years. Cuneiform\nsigns have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert paleographic\nanalysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical developments and\ntransmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior automated techniques\nmostly treat sign types as categorical and do not explicitly model their highly varied\ninternal configurations. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for\nrecovering the fine-grained internal configuration of cuneiform signs by leveraging\npowerful generative models and the appearance and structure of prototype font\nimages as priors. Our approach, ProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on\nmatches found with deep image features to estimate the diverse configurations\nof cuneiform characters, snapping a skeleton-based template to photographed\ncuneiform signs. We provide a new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate\nour method on this task. Our evaluation shows that our approach succeeds in\naligning prototype skeletons to a wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we\nshow that conditioning on structures produced by our method allows for generating\nsynthetic data with correct structural configurations, significantly boosting the\nperformance of cuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular\nover rare signs. We will release our code and data to the research community,\nforeseeing their use in a variety of applications in the digital humanities.",

In my view, the authors should not focus on a single model for feature extraction, but rather experiment with all of them in the same setting (with or without RANSAC) and present their method as a more general method for template alignment for cuneiform signs."

The prototype consists of an image of the canonical character, as well as an aligned skeleton representation of the character. The method uses deep image features from a finetuned diffusion generation model to measure the patch similarities between the prototype image and the real image. Given the similarity map, the method first applies a global affine transformation to the skeletal representation, such that the feature similarities are maximized. Then the method applies per-stroke projective transformation to the skeleton strokes, to further maximize the alignment of image features. To regularize the alignment optimization, mutual optimal matching between patches, RANSAC for global transform, as well as saliency, identity and boundary constraints for local transform are applied. \n\nThe method has been tested on a new benchmarked collected by expert annotators, and showed improved accuracy than baseline matching algorithms. The aligned image-character pairs also allow for finetuning ControlNet, so that new images can be synthesized for training OCR models, which demonstrates the benefits enabled by the method.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a fluent combination of various image processing and registration tools to solve the problem of cuneiform character recognition to a better state."

To handle such variations, the assumed projective per-stroke transform may not be sufficient. In particular:\n1. Are there any components of the current method that would need significant modification?\n2. Could the authors provide a brief analysis of how the skeleton structure and deformation models need to be adapted?\n\nFig.6 can be more specific about \"the most prevalent sign variation during training\". Which are these variants and how do you know it? Specifically, the authors can provide more insights into the dataset, by the following means:\n1. Provide quantitative data on the frequency of different sign variants in their training set, if available.\n2. Explain the method used to determine which variants were most prevalent.\n3.
