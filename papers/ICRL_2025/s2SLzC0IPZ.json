    "title": "A Fast Federated Method for Minimax Problems with Sequential Convergence Guarantees",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has recently been actively studied to collaboratively train machine learning models across clients without directly sharing data and to address data-hungry issues. Many FL works have been focusing on minimizing a loss function but many important machine learning tasks such as adversarial training, GANs, fairness learning, and AUROC maximization are formulated as minimax problems. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning method for minimax problems. Our method allows client drift and addresses the data heterogeneity issue. In theoretical analysis, we prove that our method can improve sample complexity and has convergence guarantees for the updates of the model parameters, i.e., the sequences generated by the method. Given the Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz (KL) exponent of a novel potential function related to the objective function, we demonstrate that the sequences generated by our method converge finitely, linearly, or sublinearly. Our assumptions on the KL property are weaker than previous work on the sequential convergence of centralized minimax methods. Additionally, we further weaken the KL assumption by deducing the KL exponent of the potential function from that of the original objective function. We validate our federated learning method on AUC maximization tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods when the distributions of local training data are non-IID.",

In the Introduction section, \"sequential convergence\" is used without definition. In the Preliminaries section, where such concepts like this should be discussed, it is not mentioned at all. In the main text, the word \"sequential\" appears only once in the title of Section 4.2. I would suggest that the authors provide a clear definition of \"sequential convergence\" early in the paper, ideally in the Introduction or Preliminaries section. This would help readers better understand this key concept and its importance to the method.\n- Undefined terms and notations\n\t- Equation (1): l and r are not defined\n\t- L78: \"proximal operator\" is not defined. I would recommend that the authors provide a brief definition of \"proximal operator\" when it is first introduced, as this may not be familiar to all readers.\n\t- L95: \"complexity of federated learning methods\" -> \"complexity of optimization algorithms\" or \"algorithmic complexity\".\n\t- L97: \"convergence of the model parameters themselves\" -> \"statistical convergence\" (if I understand correctly)\n\t- L195: distance is denoted as $d$, where in the rest of the paper, it is referred to as $\\text{dist}$ (L96, L247)\n- Writing\n\t- L93: \"Our work introduces methods that offer convergence guarantees without relying on these heterogeneity bounds\". When introducing the proposed methods, you may want to (1) describe the method itself, and (2) clarify the motivations. Put it another way, instead of just saying, \"we don't do A\", say \"we do B\" and \"why we choose B over A \". For example, you may say this: \"Our work introduces methods that offer convergence guarantees under (some assumption), hence do not require these (stringent) heterogeneity bounds.\"\n- Grammatical errors, typos, and minor issues\n\t- L52: it is necessary (to) develop ...\n\t- Inconsistent format: L237: *equation* 1, L285: equation 6.

                "value": "1. The experimental results in Table 2 and Fig 1 show that the improvement of FFMDR appears limited. This raises concerns about the improvement's reliability. It would be better to conduct multiple runs of experiments to report the model's average performance. \n2. The number of clients in this paper is significantly lower than that typically used in FL scenarios. I would expect to see the results of increasing the client count to better align with standard FL settings.\n3. As seen in Fig. 2, FFMDR's performance drops considerably when the number of participating clients per round is reduced across at least three datasets. It would be helpful to include other baseline comparisons under similar conditions. I am curious whether other methods also show this sensitivity to client participation levels.\n4. The major concern is the authors' claim that FFMDR reduces sample complexity in solving minimax problems within the FL. The method essentially reformulates the minimax problem in Eq. (6) into another minimax problem in Eq. (8), which doesn't appear to directly lower the complexity of solving a single minimax problem. A more detailed explanation addressing this aspect would be valuable.\n5. I gave a cursory review of the appendix to verify the technical accuracy of the derivations, although not all steps were closely examined. Some proof raises concerns due to unclear explanations or possible inaccuracies. For example:\n- In L. 853, it is unclear how the stated first inequality was derived.\n- In L.1275, the inequality might need a correction to the equality.\n- In Eq. (52), the first term in the inequality doesn't appear in the following equation, and the sixth term in L.1309 seems to be missing a summation symbol."

How does $\\epsilon_w$ affect things? How do you go from Eq (9) to Eq (10)? Where does the randomness come from (do we assume each client runs some unbiased stochastic algorithm)?\n\n- Assumption 2 is not the same as \"allowing client drift:\" how do you deal with stragglers or \"unstable network conditions\" (line 108)?\n\n- Theorem 1 is difficult to read as well, due to the many terms that were introduced but not explained. For example, $\\delta$ was introduced early on but later it was defined again as $\\delta_\\beta - \\delta'$. What is $\\delta'$ anyway? What are the roles of $\\iota, \\epsilon_w, \\delta_\\epsilon$? I was not able to parse the theorem and verify the claimed O(\\kappa^2/\\epsilon^2) complexity in Remark 2. In fact, I do not even know how we measure stationarity using $\\epsilon$ (is it $d(0, \\partial)$?)\n\n- Proposition 3 requires g to be defined everywhere but the function U in Line 426 involves $\\tilde g$, which is defined on a hyperplane at best (due to the product-space trick). How does Proposition 3 apply to the main problem studied in this work? \n\n- Line 483: perhaps it is worth mentioning that Eq (13) is not semi-algebraic so how do you verify this? (The early parts gave the impression that semi-algebraic functions suffice, but here you need a heavier machinery.)\n\n- Line 513: why do you use SGDA as the local solver in your experiments? Wouldn't that imply all of the experiments have nothing to do with the theoretical results? This discrepancy diminishes most of the claimed contributions."

Here each $f_i=\\sum_j f(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\xi_j)$ also comes with a finite-sum formation, while in Local SGDA, FedNEST, FedSGDA papers (c.f. Table 1), their $f_i=E_j f(\\cdot,\\cdot,\\xi_j)$ generally comes with a expectation formation. This difference is important in my opinion, because your SAGA (Proposition 2) cannot be applied in their cases (due to no access to the full objective $f_i$). So I think the comparison in Table 1 is not fair, and the outperformance should be further clarified.\n2. Assumption 3 requires the subroutine output to be deterministic, which basically requires each client to use deterministic algorithms to solve local problems, which is impractical regarding the large-scale data character.\n3. I don't understand the \"nonsmooth\" in Line 124 regarding the contribution. As far as I can see, the main component $f_i$ in your objective is differentiable, the regularizer $g$ is (implicitly) assumed to be prox-friendly. You mentioned in Line 130 \"... nonsmoothness of the max function...\", but Proposition 1 shows that the max function is smooth, which contrasts the nonsmoothness claim. Can you clarify it?\n4. The writing is a bit sloppy in my opinion. Some notations are not clearly defined, for example $m$ and $\\kappa$ in Proposition 2. The failure of model parameter convergence in Table 1 for other algorithms is also a bit misleading, because they didn't consider KL condition, and we should not expect such convergence in their nonconvex setting.\n\nWith that, I vote for a rejection, and expect a revision for better clarification on the authors' contribution.
