    "abstract": "Wind energy stands out as a promising clean and renewable energy alternative, not only for its potential to combat global warming but also for its capacity to meet the ever-growing demand for energy. However, analysis of wind data to fully harness the benefits of wind energy demands tackling several related challenges: \n(1) Current data resolution is inadequate for capturing the detailed information needed across diverse climatic conditions;\n(2) Efficient management and storage of real-time measurements are currently lacking;\n(3) Extrapolating wind data across spatial specifications enables analysis at costly-to-measure, unobserved points is necessary.\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce a modality-agnostic learning framework utilizing implicit neural networks. Our model effectively compresses a large volume of climate data into a manageable latent codec. It also learns underlying continuous climate patterns, enabling reconstruction at any scale and supporting modality transfer and fusion. Extensive experimental results show consistent performance improvements over existing baselines.",

                "value": "- You claim your work is **continuous** super-resolution, how finer is it to say \"continuous\"?\n- I believe there is some related work using diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for downscaling tasks. You may want to consider them as ML baselines. The current comparison against ML baselines is relatively weak.\n- As you mentioned in the related work, data sources could be text, images, audio, and video. This is why it is called multi-modal learning (generally in the AI domain). In your work, you call the data at different altitudes as different modalities. It is confusing for users, especially for ICLR readers.\n- You claim your model enables reconstruction at any scale. Do you use one model or train separate models for different scales?\n- PSNR, SSIM, and CR are used as evaluation metrics. It would be better to provide the details on how to compute them? Any equations? Adding them in the appendix also helps if you have a limited-space problem.\n- In Figure 4, it is surprising to see the model performance does not drop as the super-resolution scale increases. Could you please provide any possible reasons?\n- In section 5.6, you train the ML model on one region and test it on other regions. This is actually an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. You may want to add a short discussion on it (FYI). And, what is the meaning of the $x$-axis in Figure 6? Why are there some values between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3?"

Regression learns the mean of the conditional distribution which leads to a loss of the high-frequency information that is usually present in the wind profile (especially with turbulence).\n- It's a bit hard to parse the PSNR/SSIM figure since there's no space between them, it would be better to have a small vertical space between them."
