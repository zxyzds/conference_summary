    "title": "Towards Reliable Offline Reinforcement Learning via Lyapunov Uncertainty Control",
    "abstract": "Learning trustworthy and reliable offline policies presents significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainty in pre-collected datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel offline reinforcement learning method to tackle this issue. Inspired by the concepts of Lyapunov stability and control-invariant sets from control theory, the central idea is to introduce a restricted state space for the agent to operate within. This approach allows the learned models to exhibit reduced Bellman uncertainty and make reliable decisions. To achieve this, we regulate the expected Bellman uncertainty associated with the new policy, ensuring that its growth trend in subsequent states remains within acceptable limits. The resulting method, termed Lyapunov Uncertainty Control (LUC), is shown to guarantee that the agent remains within a low-uncertainty state enclosure throughout its entire trajectory. \nFurthermore, we perform extensive theoretical and experimental analysis to showcase the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed LUC.",

                "value": "This paper aims to bring the concept of Lyapunov control into offline reinforcement learning. In particular, they aim to tackle the problem of partial data coverage which is very well studied, both theoretically and empirically, in the literature of offline reinforcement learning. The problem of partial data coverage is subsumed under *distributional shift* problem which is a general problem that can be encountered in any learning problem with a fixed dataset, e.g., regression problem, classification problem.\n\nThe authors propose a Lyapunov-inspired pessimistic value which also draws inspiration from the work [1]. Some theoretical analysis is provided. In addition, the proposed method is tested empirically on classical MuJoCo tasks.\n\n[1]Ying Jin, Zhuoran Yang, and Zhaoran Wang.

                "value": "1. Are authors aware of distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL)? There is a large body of works in this track to tackle distributional shift issue in reinforcement learning, both offline and online. **Fundamentals of DRRL**: [1,2] ;**Offline DRRL**: [3,4] ; **Online DRRL**: [5,6]. This is a very much non-extensive list of works but many of these works shows robustness even when there is complete distribution shift, meaning that the test environment (model) is completely different from the training environment. [3,5] both have extensive simulations on MuJoCo tasks. There is another line of work which specifically tackles state adversarial attack. A notable paper will be [7].\n\nMy question is, since you include RORL in your benchmarks, why do you ignore a whole line of robust reinforcement learning works.\n\n2. If you are using pessimism to solve *partial data coverage* issue, you also omitted a seminal work [8]. Could you comment on this paper and compare it with your approach?\n\n3. Is your theoretical guarantees comparable to the ones presented in many other offline RL papers?\n\nReferences:   \n[1] Iyengar, G. N. (2005). Robust dynamic programming.

By focusing on performance rather than traditional density measures, this method offers a novel, theoretically grounded strategy for managing uncertainty in offline reinforcement learning.\n\u200b2.Strong Performance in Walker2D: Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong performance across various environments, with particularly outstanding results on the Walker2D task within the MuJoCo environment.

This capability emphasizes the model\u2019s potential to manage and reduce errors in unfamiliar states, which is essential for achieving safe and reliable offline RL."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.Similarity to EDAC\u2019s Regularization Approach: The proposed method\u2019s use of a Q-ensemble for regularization has notable similarities with the Ensemble-Diversified Actor Critic (EDAC) approach, which also employs a Q-ensemble to stabilize Q-value estimation through variance reduction and normalization. Ensemble methods are indeed a common strategy in reinforcement learning to address challenges such as overestimation and uncertainty. However, given the alignment with EDAC\u2019s approach, the novelty of the proposed method\u2019s regularization technique may not be fully distinctive. Specifically, EDAC was designed to diversify ensemble members, thereby enhancing policy stability and improving exploration via variance-based adjustments. If the current method mirrors this approach without introducing a clearly defined improvement or novel mechanism, it may be difficult to argue that the proposed regularization is an advancement rather than a reiteration.\n\u200b2.Limited Evaluation Scope: The experiments presented in this study are limited to the MuJoCo benchmark, a commonly used environment for continuous control tasks in reinforcement learning. However, focusing solely on MuJoCo may restrict the conclusions that can be drawn about the generalizability and robustness of the proposed approach. Given the objective of establishing reliable offline reinforcement learning policies under uncertainty, it would be beneficial to test the method in more complex and varied environments such as AntMaze or Android-based tasks. These environments present unique challenges, including navigation in maze-like structures and the nuanced action requirements of robotics, which are highly relevant to evaluating an RL method\u2019s capacity to operate in uncertain or OOD conditions. Testing across such diverse benchmarks would significantly strengthen the claims of robustness and adaptability, providing evidence that the proposed method is not overfit to the dynamics and characteristics of MuJoCo tasks.\n3.Absence of Direct Comparison to Conservative Offline RL Approaches: Although the study emphasizes stability through Lyapunov principles, it lacks a direct and systematic comparison with conservative offline reinforcement learning techniques, notably Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). CQL has been widely studied for its conservative penalty approach to mitigating out-of-distribution (OOD) risks in offline settings by favoring actions within the distribution of the offline data. Given that the Lyapunov-based uncertainty control also aims to limit the policy\u2019s operations to low-uncertainty (and implicitly, familiar) regions, a comparison with CQL would be invaluable in assessing whether the proposed approach offers any distinct advantage or improvement over conservative penalties in managing OOD actions. Specifically, such a comparison could clarify whether the Lyapunov-based framework introduces any measurable improvements in stability, robustness, or data efficiency compared to CQL and other conservative techniques. A comparative study would also allow for a more nuanced discussion on the benefits and trade-offs between a Lyapunov-centered approach and traditional conservative penalties, potentially uncovering limitations or situations where one may outperform the other. In the absence of this comparative analysis, it remains challenging to fully evaluate the added value and practical impact of the proposed methodology within the broader landscape of offline RL."

Results on these benchmarks could shed light on the method\u2019s generalizability across different reinforcement learning challenges.\n\u200b3.Relation to CQL in OOD Scenarios: The proposed method appears to have parallels with conservative Q-learning (CQL) in its handling of OOD data.
