    "abstract": "Model owners often wish to introduce new capabilities into their trained models or remove undesired ones. Task Vectors (TVs) present a promising new approach to editing models after training, allowing simple and controllable addition of new capabilities to the model and the removal of undesired ones. But what happens when the model owner wants to change multiple capabilities? \n\nIn this work, we study the interactions of task vectors in a multi-edit setting for image classifiers and diffusion models. We start by quantifying the overall model degradation induced by applying many specific TVs simultaneously. \nWe show that the overall model performance degrades rapidly as the quantity of TV edits increases.\nFinally, we explore different ways to mitigate this degradation and present an adaptive method to select the most relevant TVs to apply to a diffusion model during inference. Our technique achieves a 94.6% ROC AUC in identifying the correct TV, enabling the effective integration of multiple TV edits while significantly mitigating quality degradation.",

                "value": "The manuscript targets the problem of model editing on multiple tasks, over the concept of task vectors where they serve as the model weights combined with the original model o achieve the targeted task. Preliminarily, the authors first provide an analysis on how does the current approaches on applying multiple-concept editing perform, by first introducing different kinds of interactions between task vectors (linear and non-linear). In the first part of the provided analysis, authors attempt to quantitively assess the influence between them over changing performance on the desired tasks and the strength of the applied task vector. Following, the authors consider different strategies on combining the subjected task vectors. Throughout the presented experiments, the authors show how the current approaches fell short over classification oriented multi-concept editing, where they also provide discussions and background on each of the existing approaches for multi-task arithmetic.\n\nAs the second part of the manuscript, which also serves as the second contribution, they propose an inference time solution for performing multi-task arithmetic on diffusion models. In the proposed algorithm, the authors introduce an heuristic based multi-task arithmetic operation, that relies on the similarity between the images generated by edited and non-edited models. Following, they assess the performance of detecting the relevant task vectors over 6 different artistic styles."

However, the authors have no analysis on the overall effect of the applied task vectors on the image. They claim that the existing methods cannot effectively combine multiple task vectors. If the proposed algorithm is to solve this problem with an heuristic, they also need to provide an analysis on the task performance. In addition, the task performance should also be shown qualitatively with additional examples as they propose the algorithm on diffusion models.\n- The first part of the paper completely investigates the multi-task arithmetic problem over the task of classification. However, the proposed algorithm targets diffusion models completely. These two parts does not seem completely connected, and the provided analysis on multi-task editing should be extended with experiments on diffusion models also.\n- The experiments on diffusion models are limited with artistic styles, where each task vector will involve same set of features. However, it is still a question that needs to be answered that if the proposed method can handle different kinds of task vectors at the same time and is it limited to artistic styles only.\n- The details of how the authors train the task vectors is not clear. Even if an external method is used, it has to be mentioned explicitly.\n- Diffusion models encode information with different granularity over iterating timesteps[1]. As the authors also select a timestep to perform the arithmetic task, they should also discuss how the timestep selection effects the performance of task vectors (ideally with a visual analysis and demonstrations).\n- Details of the baseline models that the experiments are conducted on are not provided (i.e. the diffusion model used).\n\n[1] Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross-Attention Control, Hertz et. al., 2022."

Otherwise, it is not clear what the baseline approach is, and how existing approaches perform on the task that the algorithm is proposed on.\n- Other than identifying the task vectors, how does the proposed algorithm behave in terms of visual coherence? How does the image quality change? How well does it perform the task? This aspect is crucial for diffusion models as it helps readers to assess how visually pleasing the proposed algorithm is, in addition to how well the tasks are identified.\n- What are the algorithms used to train the task vectors?"
