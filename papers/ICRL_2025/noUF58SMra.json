    "title": "MeToken: Uniform Micro-environment Token Boosts Post-Translational Modification Prediction",
    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) profoundly expand the complexity and functionality of the proteome, regulating protein attributes and interactions that are crucial for biological processes. Accurately predicting PTM sites and their specific types is therefore essential for elucidating protein function and understanding disease mechanisms. Existing computational approaches predominantly focus on protein sequences to predict PTM sites, driven by the recognition of sequence-dependent motifs. However, these approaches often overlook protein structural contexts. In this work, we first compile a large-scale sequence-structure PTM dataset, which serves as the foundation for fair comparison. We introduce the MeToken model, which tokenizes the micro-environment of each amino acid, integrating both sequence and structural information into unified discrete tokens. This model not only captures the typical sequence motifs associated with PTMs but also leverages the spatial arrangements dictated by protein tertiary structures, thus providing a holistic view of the factors influencing PTM sites. Designed to address the long-tail distribution of PTM types, MeToken employs uniform sub-codebooks that ensure even the rarest PTMs are adequately represented and distinguished. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of MeToken across multiple datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in accurately identifying PTM types. The results underscore the importance of incorporating structural data and highlight MeToken's potential in facilitating accurate and comprehensive PTM predictions, which could significantly impact proteomics research.",

For example, SAProt using the Foldseek structural tokens learns a sturture aware embedding.\n\nThe authors demonstrate one of the codebooks as an example but a more extensive analysis on this would be interesting. For example a very basic question would be : \"Are the amino acid preferences (K for Sumoylation, S/T/Y for Phosphorylation, etc )correctly captured by the codebooks?\"\n\nInformation on the hyperparameters used to train MeToken and the baseline models are needed for reproducibility of the results.\n\nA hyperparameter sensitivity analysis would be useful. For example the codebook size, the number of neighbors in the k-nn graph etc. \n\nDistinguishing some PTMs from others are easier because of the distinct amino acid preferences in their modification sites. Hard evaluation sets up could have been designed to understand the weakness and the strength of the methodology. For example, does the model correctly differentiate a Lysine residue  being ubiquninated or sumoylated?\n\nThe authors do not provide results on performance across different PTM classes. Are certain PTMs are much easier because of the available training data?"

What criteria are applied on this selection?\nAuthors suggest that they introduce a sub-codebook strategy to handle the long-tail distribution but at the end of the day, all the rare classes are grouped as a single class.

But from table 4 it seems like this has enough boost compared to other baselines. It's beneficial to investigate deeper (and perhaps more ablation studies on only this arm of contribution) to stress the importance of added benefit of structural information.\n\nAdditionally, ESM-2 baseline seems to be very close the proposed method and beats all other baselines so there's still arguably a lot of sequence information that's useful already, so how to showcase their method is not overfitting to structural features might help reviewers to understand the validity of their method.\n\nAgain, the latter contributions, uniform sub-codebook strategy and temperature-scaled vector quantization, seems to offer marginal benefit which IMO dilutes the core contribution brought by the Micro-env arm of contribution. In addition, the temperature adjusted approach might necessitate a huge effort for hyperparameter tunning to make it work. But the authors didn't discuss any ramification of it. Further, the uniform sub-codebook strategy might risk embedding redundancy for common PTM types, and this was not discussed either."

                "value": "They highlighted the long tail nature of the current datasets in the domain but it lacks some deeper analysis for the distribution e.g. rarity analysis, frequency statistics. It's unclear the extent to which the long tail nature is currently at play for the modeling difficulty in the domain, as what they claimed as a challenge. Additionally, reducing the class imbalance by consolidating PTM types with fewer than 100 samples into a single \u201crare sites\u201d category might be exacerbate the imbalance issue? The rare classes are not modeled/studied individually then\n\nAlso, UMAP is often better at preserving global structure in the final projection. This means that the inter-cluster relations are potentially more meaningful than in t-SNE. So might want to suggest the authors to compare that visualization (see appendix c: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426)"
