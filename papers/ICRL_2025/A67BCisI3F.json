    "title": "A Diffusion-based Generative Approach for Model-free Finite-time Control of Complex Systems",
    "abstract": "Complex systems with nonlinear dynamics pose significant challenges for finite-time optimal control, especially when accurate system models are unavailable. This paper introduces DIFOCON (DIffusion Finite-time Optimal CONtrol), a novel data-driven framework for finite-time optimal control that operates without prior knowledge of system parameters or dynamics. DIFOCON reformulates the control problem as a generative task, optimizing control signal trajectories to guide systems to target states within a finite time. Our approach utilizes a diffusion model with a dual-Unet architecture to capture nonlinear system dynamics and generate entire control sequences in a single step. Additionally, an inverse dynamics module is integrated to ensure that the generated control signals are appropriate for complex systems. To further enhance performance, we propose a retraining strategy that improves out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on two nonlinear complex systems demonstrate DIFOCON's superior performance, reducing target loss by over 26.9\\% and control energy by over 15.8\\% compared to baselines while achieving up to 4 times faster convergence in practical steering tasks. The implementation of this work can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIFOCON-C019/.",

                "value": "The main weaknesses/limitations of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n1. The theoretical contribution of this paper appears to be limited. In particular, \n\n    a) The main theoretical contribution is the introduction of problem (4) which is a standard log likelihood maximization. Furthermore, it is not well justified why the selection of this optimization is proper for the control of complex systems. The authors should better justify how it relates to the original problem (1) and whether the conditioning in Eq. (4) occurs based on an underlying derivation or if it is ad-hoc approach. \n\n    b) The classifier-free guidance free idea has also been presented in a related approach in [R1]. To the reviewer's best understanding, the difference between the current paper's approach and [R1] is only on how labeling works. \n\n\n2. The related work section is short and only emphasizing in few works, rather than providing a general overview of the areas. For example, in Section 2.1, a large body of literature on deep learning based control is omitted. In addition, only two references are provided for finite-time control methods. The authors are encouraged to provide a more complete overview of the related literature, as this is of great importance for the reader to understand the motivation and importance of a proposed method.\n\n3. It is unclear whether a running state cost or constraints can be incorporated through the proposed formulation, although such specifications are often crucial to be met in complex physical systems. The problem formulation in Eq. (1) only includes a terminal state cost, and similarly, in Eq. (4) the conditioning is only on the initial and terminal states.\n\n4. It seems that in Eq. (4) there is also a conditioning on the \"optimization goal\" J which is the desired cost. Nevertheless, such an approach might encounter the following limitations: i) It is often very hard to \"predict\" what a good cost is - especially in complex physical systems. ii) If the cost J used for conditioning is worse (higher) than the optimal cost of Eq. (1), then the proposed approach might \"force\" the resulting policy to be worse than it should. On the other hand, if the guess for the optimization goal is too good to be feasible (too low), then no trajectories will satisfy this conditioning. The authors are encouraged to comment on this issue.\n\n5. The actual implementation of the proposed methodology is not clearly explained in the paper. An algorithm figure is missing showing the steps and how the described components are integrated in practice (e.g., inpainting, inverse dynamics). \n\n6. The advantages of the presented method are only shown in two systems. The authors are encouraged to explore more complex physical systems with performance specifications encoded throughout the tasks, constraints, etc. \n\n[R1] Li, A., Ding, Z., Dieng, A.

                "value": "1. The authors are encouraged to elaborate on the derivation of Eq. (4), (5) and how it is connected to the original problem in Eq. (1). Is there an underlying mathematical derivation that is missing or is the proposed formulation in Eq. (4), (5) an ad-hoc approach for tackling problem (1)?\n\n2. Can the proposed methodology be extended for handling running state costs and/or state constraints? Given that the motivation for this approach is the control of complex physical systems, these are specifications that are often significant to be met in practice in such applications. \n\n3. To the reviewer's best understanding, conditioning on the optimization goal J in Eq. (4) can lead to issues such as the ones described in weakness (4). Could the authors provide a clarification on that?\n\n4. Although the inpainting idea sounds interesting, it is not clearly explained and especially how it applies on a control of complex systems perspective. The authors are invited to further elaborate on how inpainting works in their problem setting. \n\n5. While the experiments section is helpful to evaluate the performance of the method, its scalability is not investigated. How does this framework scale with an increasing dimensionality in the studied problems?  \n\n6. In Eq. (11), the authors use the variable $\\tau$ to refer to the dataset consisting of the set of trajectories and controls. However, it appears that in the optimization $\\tau$ also corresponds to the parameterized conditional classifier-free diffusion model. Could the authors provide a clarification on why the same symbol is used for both?"

There are many papers that use the conditional diffusion model to generate optimal control solutions in a purely data-driven fashion.

For example, why does the author choose DiffPhyCon as there are other diffusion methods like [1] that can be used in similar tasks? Not to mention that in Table 2, the DiffPhyCon doesn't have a stable time. Overall, the diffusion model results are far behind other methods. What is the intuition behind it?\n3. The experiment results are not very convincing. In Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 4, no statistics are provided for the results.  The difference in the results can be marginal.\n\n\n[1] Anurag Ajay, Yilun Du, Abhi Gupta, Joshua Tenenbaum, Tommi Jaakkola, and Pulkit Agrawal.
