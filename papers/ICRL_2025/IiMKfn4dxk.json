    "title": "Capturing substructure interactions by invariant Information Bottle Theory for Generalizable Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "Molecular interactions are a common phenomenon in physical chemistry, often resulting in unexpected biochemical properties harmful to humans, such as drug-drug interactions. Machine learning has shown great potential for predicting these interactions rapidly and accurately. However, the complexity of molecular structures and the diversity of interactions often reduce prediction accuracy and hinder generalizability. Identifying core invariant substructures (i.e., rationales) has become essential to improving the model's interpretability and generalization. Despite significant progress, existing models frequently overlook the pairwise molecular interaction, leading to insufficient capture of interaction dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose I2Mole (Interaction-aware Invariant Molecular learning), a novel framework for generalizable property prediction. I2Mole meticulously models atomic interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces, by first establishing indiscriminate connections between intermolecular atoms, which are then refined using an improved graph information bottleneck theory tailored for merged graphs. To further enhance model generalization, we construct an environment codebook by environment subgraph of the merged graph. This approach not only could provide noise source for optimizing mutual information but also preserve the integrity of chemical semantic information. By comprehensively leveraging the information inherent in the merged graph, our model accurately captures core substructures and significantly enhances generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates I2Mole's efficacy and generalizability. The implementation code is available at https://anonymous.4open/r/I2Mol-C616.",

The environment is defined based on portions of the merged graph outside of the core substructure, yet the physical and chemical environment where interactions occur, as well as other external conditions, are not considered.\n\n* Although quantitative metrics demonstrate the model\u2019s superiority, it is disappointing that the paper does not provide evidence that the model captures emergent structures specific to interactions, as suggested in the introduction. Showing such examples would better highlight the effectiveness of the model in learning interaction-specific substructures.\n\n* Numerous formatting, notation, and equation issues need correction:\n    * Inconsistent usage of \"I2Mol\" and \"I2Mole.\"\n    * In Equation (5), the definition of $k$ is missing\n    * Redundant wording in \"$u$ is is updated into $u_i^{'}$.\"\n    * Misaligned square brackets in Equation (6).\n    * In Equation (10), $s$ is defined by the top $s$%, but the equation appears to represent a threshold.\n    * In Equation (24), the definition of $||$ is missing.\n    * The following sentence in Section 4.2 seems to belong in Section 4.3: \"Type 1 aims to predict potential interaction properties between known and unseen drugs, while Type 2 aims to predict potential interaction properties between unseen and unseen drugs.\""

Core substructure identification is then performed on this graph applying GIB, in particular, \"compression via noise injection (Yu et al., 2022b).\" In (2), several latent environmental factors in the training data are represented as learnable embedding vectors, and prediction robustness is enhanced by clustering non-core substructure variations through learning vector quantization (LVQ).

                "value": "- Overall, the paper is intriguing, but the description in Section 3.3, one of the two main ideas, is highly unclear and falls short of publication standards. For example, at the start of Section 3.3, it states that \\tilde{G}_{IB} is obtained from Equation (19), but in its definition, it is derived via optimization in Equation (12), which is contradictory. Additionally, mutual information is represented as I(Y; \\tilde{G}_{IB}) in Equation (12) but as MI(\\tilde{G}_{IB}, Y) in Equation (19), showing inconsistency in notation. In Section 3.1, \\\\tilde{G}_{IB} is defined as a graph, yet in Equations (20)\u2013(22), it is treated as a multivariate vector apparently, with no explanation of this difference within the paper. Furthermore, the description of q(\\tilde{G}_{IB}) in Equation (20) as \u201cthe distribution of data under environment \\tilde{G}_{IB}\u201d is too vague to understand, and defining \\tilde{G}_{IB} as a subgraph of \\tilde{G} while expressing (\\tilde{G}_{IB}, Y) \\sim q(\\tilde{G}_{IB}) is unclear.\n\n- Numerous simple typos are found throughout the draft. For instance, in the title \u201cBottle\u201d should be \u201cBottleneck\u201d; in Section 2.1, \u201ca molecular\u201d should be \u201ca molecule\u201d; \u201cis is\u201d on line 187 should be \u201cis\u201d; parentheses in Equation (6) do not match; \u201cEquation equation\u201d on line 219 should be \u201cequation\u201d; in Equation (19), MI(\\tilde{G}_{IB}, Y) should be I(Y; \\tilde{G}_{IB}); there is inconsistency on whether \\tilde{G}_{IB} is a graph or a vector; and \u201cvertor\u201d on line 479 should be \u201cvector.\u201d\n\n- Regarding Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 on GIB applications, the approach primarily applies Yu et al. (2022b)\u2019s method to a merged graph, which lacks technical originality. It would be better to clarify this point, as the sections present ideas from Yu et al. (2022b) as if they were original derivations, which is misleading. If these points are self-evident, emphasizing the proofs is unnecessary.\n\n- The term \u201cout-of-distribution generalization\u201d requires discussion. Since this paper primarily addresses adaptations to environmental changes within the training data by modeling environment patterns through clustering, it focuses on robustness within the training data rather than an out-of-distribution approach. Typically, \u201cout-of-distribution\u201d refers to data outside the training distribution, so calling this an OOD method could be quite misleading. The original idea in Section 2.3 would be assuming that the external environments can be represented by latent factors, therefore the adjustment of Eq(2) would make sense to achieve unbiased predictions to mitigate any potential OOD biases."

Since $\\tilde{G}_{GIB}$ is obtained through the optimization in Equation (12), shouldn\u2019t it be referring to that equation rather than Equation (19)? Also, why is the notation for mutual information inconsistent? Any special meaning here?\n\n- In Section 3.3, it seems that \\tilde{G}_{GIB} is treated as a vector. How is this derived? If it\u2019s obtained through some form of global pooling, the procedure should be clearly specified and reflected in the notation. The paper defines \\tilde{G}_{GIB} as a graph, so Equations (20) and (21)\u2013(22) doesn't make any sense.\n\n- The probability distribution $q$ assumed in $(\\tilde{G}, Y) \\sim q(\\tilde{G}_{GIB})$ and the sampling process from it are unclear. With respect to what variable is the expectation $\\mathbb{E}$ taken?\n\n- Also, $\\tilde{G}_{GIB}$ is a subgraph of a graph from the training data, so it seems it would not contain information beyond the training set.
