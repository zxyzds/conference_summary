    "title": "Explainable Transfer Learning on Graphs Using a Novel Label Frequency Representation",
    "abstract": "Graphs are characterized by their versatility in representing objects from a wide range of domains, such as social networks or protein structures. This flexibility and power poses a significant challenge for  transfer learning between graph domains. Current methods of transfer learning between graph domains tend to focus exclusively on the structure of the underlying graphs, neglecting the characteristics of the nodes and not addressing the difficulties in comparing  nodes that represent very dissimilar entities, such as atoms and people for instance. In this paper, we propose a novel universal representation of graphs based on the relative frequency of the node labels. This novel representation enables explainable transfer learning between labeled graphs from different domains for the first time, without the need for additional adaptations. That is, we show that our novel representation can be readily combined with a data alignment technique that in turn allows transfer learning between data from different domains. Experimental results show that knowledge can be acquired from graphs belonging to chemical and biological domains to improve the accuracy of classification models in social network analysis. A comparison with state-of-the-art techniques indicates that our approach outperforms existing non-topological methods and, in some cases, even graph neural networks. In summary, our technique represents a major advance in graph node representation for transfer learning between different domains, opening up new perspectives for future research.",

                "value": "1.\tThe technical contribution of the proposed method is severely limited. The proposed relative frequency of node labels is essentially an ad-hoc heuristic method, similar to the term frequency (TF) in natural language processing that dates back to the 20th century. Considering the fast development of graph machine learning and data mining techniques in recent decades, this somewhat antiquated method is of limited novelty and no longer of interest to the general audience.  \n2.\tOne particular drawback of the metric is that it does not use any graph structure information, which is vital in graph machine learning. In other words, the proposed method essentially treats a graph as a set of its node labels, disregarding any relational information. Though the authors mention this in the limitation and future direction part, I believe this is a fundamental flaw that is unacceptable for a technical paper for graph machine learning.  \n3.\tBesides, another key drawback of the proposed method is that it is based purely on heuristics and does not have learning ability, which is a major difference between manually designed patterns and machine learning or deep learning based methods.  \n4.\tIn experiments, the authors only conduct experiments on TUDataset, which is too small and known to not be able to compare different methods. More experiments on large-scale benchmarks, such as Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), should be adopted to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.   \n\nAll in all, I believe the technical quality of this paper is far from a top-tier conference. If the authors could truly demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple method through comprehensive experiments, it may be possible to rewrite this paper into a \u201crethinking\u201d-like or \u201ca simple but effective\u201d-like paper, but the current experiments and claims are clearly not sufficient."

The approach resembles a basic graph learning method using hand-crafted features in a transfer learning setting. The authors should provide additional experimental results to demonstrate the method\u2019s superiority over GNNs in the transfer learning setting.\n\n4. Although the authors aim to address transfer learning across graphs, the experimental results (Tables 1\u20134) do not show significant performance gains when pretraining on other datasets.
