    "title": "REBIND: Enhancing Ground-state Molecular Conformation Prediction via Force-Based Graph Rewiring",
    "abstract": "Predicting the ground-state 3D molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs is critical in computational chemistry due to its profound impact on molecular properties. Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently, significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (*i.e.*, low coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose **ReBind**, a novel framework that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental results demonstrate that **ReBind** significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20% reduction in prediction error.",

By adding edges based on Lennard-Jones potential, REBIND captures non-bonded interactions between low-degree atoms.

                "value": "This work presents a novel contribution to molecular conformation prediction, primarily through its force-based graph rewiring mechanism. By incorporating the Lennard-Jones potential for non-bonded interactions, REBIND effectively addresses the low-degree atoms, which often suffer from high prediction errors in conventional models. The proposed force-aware edges between atoms provide an extra solution for creating molecular graphs besides relying on bonds and pairwise distances. REBIND could inspire further research in both conformer generation and broader applications in molecular property prediction.\n\nThis work contains rigorous experimental design and comprehensive evaluation on well-established datasets (QM9, Molecule3D, GEOM-DRUGS). The quantitative results are compelling, showing substantial improvements over baseline methods across multiple metrics.\n\nIn terms of clarity, the paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the related concepts."

Is my understanding correct? Are there key contributions I'm missing? With this in mind, while this is an interesting idea, I\u2019m not sure it needs a 9 pages paper, especially if the experimental validation is not very strong. \n\nRegarding the experimental validation, my main concern is the task definition and the way that it is evaluated. Molecular conformer generation methods do not aim to generate a single pose but multiple poses that represent the different low-energy conformation that the molecule can take. For this reason, the objective function with which they are typically trained are very different than the one used by the authors and the evaluation metrics are also significantly different and look not at the accuracy in capturing one pose but the whole set. A metric like the E-RMSE that the authors propose makes no sense to me: we are optimizing for the models to learn a weighted geometric average of the different conformations. For example, if we have two poses equally energetically favorable, this evaluation function would rank best the method that predicts the geometric average of these two poses, why would this be an interesting conformation? I believe the authors should adopt the metrics regularly used in the molecular conformer generation field that look at coverage & precision of the generated poses as well as their energetic properties."

If this is the case, the sampling bias in the training/evaluation set might be the reason for large errors for low-degree atoms.\nIf a predicted conformation has a large RMSD with one ground truth, maybe it is also in an energy-favored state, but not included in the evaluation. \n\nFurthermore, flexibility in non-bonded conformations may not adversely impact empirical applications, as real-world cases often involve ensembles of multiple conformations."

                "value": "This article proposes a method, REBIND, to enhance the performance of deep learning (DL)-based molecular ground-state conformation prediction. The authors begin by identifying a key limitation in current approaches, which primarily rely on chemical bond information and interatomic distances but fail to adequately model atomic interactions, particularly for non-bonded atom pairs influenced by van der Waals potentials. Through detailed observations and statistical analysis, the authors conclude that current methods tend to accumulate more significant errors in predicting conformations of low-degree (i.e., low coordination numbers) molecules with fewer chemical bonds. This supports their viewpoint on the limitations of existing methods. To address this shortcoming, the authors introduce an approach based on the Lennard-Jones potential, deriving a new connectivity framework (comprising two adjacency matrices, $A^{attr}$ for attractive forces and for $A^{rep}$ repulsive forces) to redefine the molecular graph. By adding these new edges, the model enhances the representation of non-bonded atomic interactions as a form of data augmentation. The overall model architecture builds upon the GMTGC [1] network, replacing its original interatomic relation modeling component, $D^{row-sub}$, with the newly proposed $A^{attr}$ and $A^{rep}$, thereby strengthening the native self-attention mechanism. The results are clear and well-documented, strongly supporting the authors\u2019 assertions. Comparative experiments demonstrate that these improvements lead to significant performance gains across various datasets.\n\nFor me, a major strength of this work is its clear observations and straightforward improvements that lead to noticeable performance gains, with a well-organized structure throughout. However, the methodological contributions feel somewhat modest. Given that molecular ground-state conformation prediction is still an underexplored area, this work holds potential to drive further advancements in the field.\n\n[1] Xu, Guikun, et al. \"GTMGC: Using Graph Transformer to Predict Molecule\u2019s Ground-State Conformation.\" *The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations*."
