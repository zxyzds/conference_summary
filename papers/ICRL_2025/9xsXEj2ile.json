    "title": "BiAssemble: Learning Collaborative Affordance for Bimanual Geometric Assembly",
    "abstract": "Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a crucial skill for robots with broad real-world applications. Among the various assembly tasks, geometric assembly\u2014where broken parts are reassembled into their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)\u2014is particularly challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping, assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity  of broken parts, we introduce a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods.",

The multi-stage framework involves some assumptions, such as the object having two broken parts, the imaginary assembled shape being obtainable in advance, and the robot needing to follow the alignment and assembly process. This means that the framework may work well in this specific task, perhaps benefiting from pre-set assumptions, but it may not generalize to other scenarios, such as a cup breaking into several pieces.\n\n2. I believe that the performance of this framework is affected by the quality of the imaginary assembled shape, which may be more difficult to achieve than the subsequent processes. Discussing this aspect would be helpful for this paper.\n\n3. Although the results show that the performance of this framework surpasses previous methods, they are not good enough (only an average of 24).
