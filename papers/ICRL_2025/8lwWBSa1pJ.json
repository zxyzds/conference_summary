    "title": "Time-aware World Model:  Adaptive Learning of Task Dynamics",
    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce Time-Aware World Model, a model-based approach designed to explicitly incorporate the temporal dynamics of environments. By conditioning on the time step size, $\\Delta t$, and training over a diverse range of $\\Delta t$ values - rather than relying on a fixed time step size - our model enables learning of both high- and low-frequency task dynamics in real-world control problems. Inspired by the information-theoretic principle that the optimal sampling rate varies depending on the underlying dynamics of different physical systems, our time-aware model enhances both performance and learning efficiency. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline approaches across different observation rates in various control tasks, using the same number of training samples and iterations. We will release our source code on GitHub once the final review decisions are made.",

They show that empirically this approach outperforms the baseline method, which was trained with a fixed time step size, when tested with a different $\\Delta t$."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The motivation referring to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem does not seem to be consistent with the observation of numerical experiments. From the sampling theorem, as long as the sampling frequency is high enough, there won't be any information loss. But the numerical experiments suggest that the non time-aware model performs poorly even when the sampling frequency is the highest. This inconsistency makes the connection to the sampling theorem questionable.\n\n- During the training phase, the sampling step is randomly selected from a log-uniform distribution. It is suggested that this distribution helps stabilize the training process, but no theoretical nor numerical analysis is provided. Some ablation studies using different sampling distribution might provide some insights to the choice.\n\n- In the numerical evaluation, performance is compared across different observation rate. Given any time-step, the time-aware model can provide the appropriate prediction by conditioning on the time-step. But for the model trained with a fixed time-step, the information of the observation time-step does not seem to be adjusted. For example, for a model trained with $\\Delta t=1$ms, when evaluating at $\\Delta t=2$ms, instead of applying the model once, one might want to apply the model twice to have a more accurate prediction given the knowledge of the doubled time-step. Without doing some kind of adjustments for the baseline models make the fairness of comparisons questionable.\n\n- When trained and evaluated with the same time-step, Figure 5 shows similar performance between the baseline model and the time-aware model. This makes the effectiveness of the proposed methods questionable when the goal is just to achieve good performance. Maybe under some scenarios where the training time-step and evaluation time-step are different, the proposed method might make more sense."

                "value": "This paper emphasizes the importance of incorporating temporal information $\\Delta t$ into dynamic modeling and introduces a mixture-of-time-step training framework that learns task dynamics across multiple frequencies. The authors' motivation stems from the existence of multi-scale dynamical systems, where each subsystem may operate at a unique frequency, and from the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which implies that lower sampling frequencies reduce performance, while higher sampling frequencies improve accuracy but increase sample complexity and reduce learning efficiency. Their approach involves conditioning all components of a world model, except the encoder, on $\\Delta t$ and using the Euler or RK4 integration method to reformulate the dynamic model. The authors experimentally validate their method on several control tasks from the Meta-World suite, using TD-MPC2 as the baseline. They demonstrate that their time-aware modifications to TD-MPC2 yield superior performance over the baseline when evaluated across varying frequencies at test time, all while maintaining the same sample efficiency."

In its current form, the paper lacks sufficient novelty to fully engage readers. I recommend that the authors either incorporate experiments in more complex environments to demonstrate real-world applicability or create more challenging scenarios, such as those requiring adaptation to varying $\\Delta t$ within the same episode.\n\n\n- The authors claim that smaller frequencies increase sample complexity and are therefore lead to inefficient learning. However, the paper lacks theoretical or experimental evidence to explain why this is true. To strengthen this claim and further support the motivation for time-aware world models, I suggest adding smaller frequencies to the experiment in Figure 4 and comparing their sample complexity with that of the time-aware model. This addition would provide valuable insight into the efficiency benefits of the proposed approach."

Would it be reasonable to combine these sections, or are they based on distinct motivations?\n\n- Since TD-MPC2 assumes an underlying MDP structure, I suggest replacing $o_t$ with $s_t$ in Section 4.1 to avoid confusion with observations in a POMDP setting."
