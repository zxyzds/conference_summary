    "abstract": "Medical time series (MedTS) classification is critical for a wide range of healthcare applications such as Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. However, its real-world deployment is severely challenged by poor generalizability due to inter- and intra-dataset heterogeneity in MedTS, including variations in channel configurations, time series lengths, and diagnostic tasks.\nHere, we propose FORMED, a foundation classification model that leverages a pre-trained backbone\nand tackles these challenges through re-purposing. FORMED integrates the general representation learning enabled by the backbone foundation model and the medical domain knowledge gained on a curated cohort of MedTS datasets. FORMED can adapt seamlessly to unseen MedTS datasets, regardless of the number of channels, sample lengths, or medical tasks.\nExperimental results show that, without any task-specific adaptation, the repurposed FORMED achieves performance that is competitive with, and often superior to, 11 baseline models trained specifically for each dataset. Furthermore, FORMED can effectively adapt to entirely new, unseen datasets, with lightweight parameter updates, consistently outperforming baselines. Our results highlight FORMED as a versatile and scalable model for a wide range of MedTS classification tasks, positioning it as a strong foundation model for future research in MedTS analysis.",

                "value": "The paper introduces FORMED, a new generalization method for foundation models. It introduces a novel mechnanism called re-purposing, designed for generalizable medical time series (MedTS) classification tasks. Generalization in medical time series data is challenging due to inter- and intra-dataset heterogeneity and data insufficiency, which often hinder model adaptability across various datasets. To overcome these issues, FORMED uses a pre-trained foundation model, TimesFM, as a backbone model and employs a two-stage procedure of re-purposing and adapting. In the re-purposing stage,  it learns the weights of the channel embedding, label query, and classifier. During the stage of adapting, it learns only the weights of the channel embedding and label query, while keeping the classifier frozen. This setup allows the channel embedding and label query to be tailored to specific datasets and tasks,  while the classifier retains essential domain knowledge. As a result, FORMED can adapt effectively to new datasets with varying channel configurations, lengths, and diagnostic tasks. Through evaluations on a curated cohort of five MedTS datasets, the model consistently outperforms traditional task-specific and task-adaptive models, maintaining high performance. \n\nI believe this paper aims to introduce a novel transfer learning paradigm specifically for medical time series dataasets. However, I think some modules and configurations are unclear and require more details. Additionally, based on my experience with biosignal data, the performance appears suboptimal compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the model still requires training a very large classifier (8 million parameters), and given its relatively poor performance, I am not seeing clear advantages. If these points can be addressed, I would consider revisiting my assessment."

                "value": "I believe the main strength of this study lies in its clear motivation and the reasonable solutions it proposes.\n\n1. This study clearly addresses the existing challenges, such as inter-dataset heterogeneity, intra-dataset heterogeneity, and data insufficiency. For instance, a biosignal dataset may contain recordings from multiple participants, each with a unique health status, leading to notable intra-dataset heterogeneity. Additionally, across different datasets, biosignals often exhibit distinct patterns; for example, ECG and heart rate data both describe heart function but follow completely different temporal patterns.\n\n2. It clearly identifies the challenges in adapting foundation models for the time-series domain, particularly the need for a dataset-specific alignment module and output layer, which limits the model\u2019s generalization across different datasets.\n\n3. This study proposes a reasonable two-stage solution. In the stage of re-purporsing, it introduces a generalization classifier designed to capture the domain knowledge, through the transformer's attention module. In the adaptation stage, it learns the channel embedding and label query specifically tailored to each dataset and task.\n\n4. In the adaptation stage, it requires learning only 30k parameters, making minimal modifications to the task head and avoiding specificity to a single task."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The primary weakness of this paper is its suboptimal performance on medical time series datasets compared to existing methods. Additionally, some modules and configurations are not clearly explained. Given that experimental performance is the main concern, I will begin by discussing limitations in the experiments and model comparisons.\n\n1. In the two-stage solution, its re-purposing stage involves a training of large classifier with 8 million parameters. This parameter size is actually larger than that of some pre-trained models on the medical time series data, which raises questions about the benefits of this adaption approach.\n\n\n    For instance, Cross Reconstruction Transformer (CRT) introduces a dropping-and-reconstruction pre-training paradigm. Its default setup is 6 encoder layers, 2 decoder layers, and an embedding size of 128, resulting in a model with 3.9 million parameters. Both this study and the CRT paper use PTB-XL biosignal data, which is the largest biosignal dataset used in this study. Consequently, a 4-million-parameter Transformer is sufficient for pretraining, while this adaption method needs to train a classifier with 8 million parameters. It is problematic if domain adaptation requires an even larger adapter, as this undermines the idea of efficient adaptation.\n\n    [1] Self-Supervised Time Series Representation Learning via Cross Reconstruction Transformer. IEEE NNLS, 2023. \n\n2. The classification performance of this paper actually is not impressive. In terms of PTB dataset, it is a very simple binary classification task. As it is simple, we did not really see recent works about pre-training or adaption make it as benchmark. For example, a simple convolution-based model with thousands of parameters can achieve an accuracy of 95%, while the baseline of RNN and SVM can also achieve over 90% [2]. However, in this paper, the proposed method and Transformer baselines are ranged from 73% to 86%, signficantly lower than exisitng methods. \n\n    [2] ECG Heartbeat Classification: A Deep Transferable Representation. ICHI, 2018.\n\n3. The experimental results on the PTB-XL dataset are also lower than those of existing methods. For instance, this paper references the Biosignal Transformer, which achieves a balanced accuracy of 84.21%, an AUPRC of 92.21%, and an AUROC of 76.59%. Additionally, the CRT model reports an accuracy of 87.81% and an AUROC of 89.22%. In contrast, FORMED achieves a balanced accuracy of 71.31%, an AUPRC of 63.67%, and an AUROC of 88.44%. Other related works on this dataset also generally achieve accuracy scores over 80%.\n\n    [3] BIOT: Biosignal Transformer for Cross-data Learning in the Wild. NeurIPS, 2023.\n\n4. The experiments also do not show the advantages of FORMED compared to Task-Specific Model (TSM). For example, the baseline among TSMs are 2% higher than FORMED. Morever, most of baselines are designed for forecasting, like Informer, Autoformer, Fedformer, which may not be suitable baseline. This paper may include Transformer-based baselines for classification tasks. \n\n5. The datasets used in this study are relatively easy for classification tasks due to their shorter sampling lengths, ranging from 250 to 300. Specifically, this study uses PTB-XL with a sequence length of 250. In contrast, CRT employs a sequence length of 5000, and BIOT uses a sequence length of 2500, making those tasks more challenging.\n\n6. I also have questions about the rationale behind using the foundation model TimesFM. This paper states, \"Repurposing the foundation model involves changing the forecasting head to a classification head\", and \"Foundation models have showcased their capability in capturing general time series patterns, through pre-training on forecasting tasks\". Here, the forecasting pre-training task implies using a sequence to predict another sequence, whereas next-token prediction refers to using a historical sequence to predict the next token.\n\n\n    However, as far as I know, most foundation models rely on next-token prediction rather than forecasting tasks. It should be noted that TimesFM, with its forecasting-based pre-training, is an unusual case. In comparison, next-token prediction is generally better suited for learning generalizable knowledge, often enabling zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities [4,5].\n\n\n    As a result, I am uncertain about the rationale for re-purposing by changing the head, as **the primary purpose** of a foundation model is to capture inherent generalizable knowledge.\n\n\n    [4] Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners.\n\n\n    [5] Language Models are Few-Shot Learners.\n\n\n7. Although this study highlights the challenges of domain adaptation in medical time series data, such as inter-dataset heterogeneity, intra-dataset heterogeneity, and data insufficiency, no experiments demonstrate these aspects. \n\n    Aside from the benchmarking results, there is a lack of informative ablation studies, and no experiments are provided to support various claims made in the paper.\n\n\n8.

                "value": "I have a few questions, and I\u2019m unsure whether they represent limitations of the paper or simply my own confusion. Could you please help clarify?\n\n1. Task-Specific Design: Is the proposed method in this paper specific to classification tasks? If I wanted to adapt it to a different type of task, such as regression or anomaly detection, would it require retraining a new layer to replace the very large classifier?\n\n\n2. Use of Transformer Decoder Layer for Classification: Instead of a simple linear classifier, the paper employs a Transformer decoder layer called Shared Decoding Attention (SDA). Since the SDA mechanism only generates an output embedding, I\u2019m unclear on how a decoder layer or attention module can perform classification directly. Could you clarify the role of this module in classification?\n\n    I assume it applied label query of **Q \\in K \\times D** and generates output embedding with a shape of ** K \\times D**. And how will it make classification?\n\n3. How does this SDA module adapt to different classification tasks? The paper claims that the attention module gains domain knowledge during the re-purposing stage, but I am uncertain how an attention layer trained on a limited biosignal dataset can generalize to unseen data.\n\n    For example, if the model is re-purposed by training this attention layer on ECG and EEG signals, it might learn domain knowledge specific to heart or brain functions. It is reasonably adapted to related signals like heart rate during the adapting stage. However, how would this model handle entirely unrelated signals in unseen datasets (i.e., inter-dataset Heterogeneity), such as body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, or blood pressure?"

A combination of a Transformer decoder layer and a residual network is also employed to form the desired output: it is trained during repurposing but frozen during adaptation.\n\nFORMED is thus a lightweight model: training it after repurposing only requires training of the channel and task embeddings.\n\nThe authors use a pretrained TimesFM backbone and demonstrate the high performance of their repurposing approach on five medical datasets, and of their adapting approach on fractions of a sixth unseen medical dataset."

Unfortunately, the authors do not provide any quantitative results demonstrating the time and computational efficiencies of their method, especially when compared to task-specific and task-adapted models; they merely provide arbitrary parameter counts. \n\nMoreover, the most common scenario for medical institutions is supposed to be adaptation of a repurposed model, as it requires the least amount of data and computational resources. Yet, the proof provided by the authors that adaptation works is very limited (fractions of a single dataset, only two competing models, and again no efficiency results).\n\nFinally, the claims at the end of section 4.3 are scarcely substantiated: for example, the \"domain knowledge\" gained by the SDA during repurposing is never demonstrated.\n\nIn the current state of the paper, it is impossible to assess how significant the authors' contribution is.\n\nAdditionally:\n- At line 284, the authors state that they are \"processing each channel of input individually\", which means that before the SDA block and thus within the backbone model where most of the weights are, channels are processed independently.
