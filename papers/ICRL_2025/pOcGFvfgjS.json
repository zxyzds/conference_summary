    "title": "AR-1-to-3: Single Image to Consistent 3D Object Generation via Next-View Prediction",
    "abstract": "Represented by Zero123 series of works, recent advancements in single-view 3D generation research have shown prominent progress by utilizing pre-trained 2D diffusion generation models. These approaches either generate multiple discrete views of a 3D object from a single-view image and a set of camera poses or produce multiple views simultaneously under specified camera conditions. However,\nit is hard to maintain consistency across different views and camera angles, especially for poses with large differences. In this paper, we introduce AR-1-to-3, a novel paradigm to generate multi-view images according to the input single image with significantly improved consistency in details. We achieve this by designing a novel auto-regressive scheme where novel views are generated based on previous views. The core of our method is first to generate views closer to the input view, which is utilized as contextual information to prompt the generation of farther views. To this end, we propose two image conditioning strategies, termed as Stacked-LE and LSTM-GE, to encode the sequence views. Particularly, Stacked-LE encodes the previously generated views into a stack embedding, which is employed as a local condition to modify the key and value matrices of the self-attention layers for denoising the target views of the current step. Meanwhile, LSTM-GE divides the previously generated views into two groups based on their elevations, whose feature vectors are encoded by two LSTM modules into high-level semantic information for global conditioning. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset show that our method can synthesize more consistent 3D views and produce high-quality 3D assets that closely mirror the given image. Code and pre-trained weights will be made publicly available.",

This paper proposes a novel AR diffusion approach with hybrid-architecture (block-wise casual attention and LSTM). The authors conduct experiments on Objverse and report quantitative results on it, outperforming other recent works. They also investigate the impact of synthesis order, demonstrating improved results when compared to random and reverse order generation. This AR diffusion approach might be applied to lots of other problems."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are a key design choices and questions in AR-diffusion which are not closely disscused. \n\n1. **Noise strategy**: The authors mention adding the same noise timestep to both reference and target frames. However, there is no explanation or ablation study to justify this choice. Why was this approach chosen over others? For example, you can keep reference frames as clean images, and only add noise to target denosing views. Or you can add indenpendent noise levels, or using increasing noise levels for target views.\n\n2. **Efficient Parallel Training Across Target and References frames**.   For example, when using an input image and reference views 0 and 1 to denoise target views 2 and 3, is the loss calculated only for target views 2 and 3? With block-wise causal attention and the same-noise-level strategy, it seems possible to calculate diffusion loss for reference views (e.g., views 0 and 1) as well. How would this impact the results? Idealy, this seems more efficient, right? Like in LLM nowdays, decoder-only arch can compute loss at every tokens, but Bert-based approach can only compute loss at MASK tokens, which is not that efficient (regarding the number of loss tokens divided by the number of FLOPS). \n\n   \n\nAnother comments, which might seems objective. The authors seems to suggest that AR diffusion might produces more 3D consistent results compared to full sequence diffusion ones. Though, when doing full sequence diffusion, the target frames cannot extract features from clean reference frames (because reference frames are at the same noise level as current frames), this claim remains unconvincing for me, without direct comparisons using the same model architecture, data, and computational resources. \n\n\n\nI think it's better to add some citations for other AR-diffusion paper, though not applied to the same task, like DiffusionForcing, Rolling Diffusion Models, and Pyramid Flow (Came out on Oct, you don't need to cite it now, but recommend to cite later.)."

                "value": "1. The evaluation is conducted only on the synthetic dataset Objaverse. Given that ABO and GSO are commonly used benchmarks in this field, could you provide additional results on these datasets?\n2. Several ablations are missing. For instance, what is the impact of the LSTM on model performance and inference speed? Why is the noise added to the reference frames the same as for the target frames?\n3. Do you observe any error accumulation effects? AR algorithms trained with teacher forcing often suffer from error accumulation. Out of curiosity, have you observed increasing artifacts in later synthesized views? or maybe 6 views is not long enough to observe strong error accumulation artifacts. \n4. Regarding Figure 5, does the reported FLOPs represent the entire model or just the attention module? If it's for the attention module alone, could you also provide the total model FLOPs? This would help in understanding the extent of computational savings achieved by the alpha parameter in a single evaluation (also, consider mentioning if KV-cache can be used when generating new views)."

Although SyncDreamer cannot generate the specific poses as AR-1-to-3's, it is unfair to compare with the renderings of reconstructed meshes. Because the step of reconstruction and then rendering will reduce the quality of the images.\n2. Fixed generation poses and numbers restricts the ability of the model to fully utilize its capabilities. Leveraging autoregressive scheme, it is natural to generate arbitrary poses or numbers of novel views. Otherwise, there is no substantial benefit in adopting this approach, which consumes more resources and time. Could you please discuss the potential for extending your method to generate arbitrary poses or numbers of views, and to analyze the trade-offs between flexibility and computational cost in your approach.\n3. Insufficient evaluation dataset. Evaluating only on Objaverse is limited, and more testing datasets should be evaluated, such as Scanned Objects by Google Research."

From the reviewer's perspective, generating views auto-regressively will cause an accumulation error. If there exists inconsistency in the initially generated two views, will the encoded feature be affected? Or should there be any designs to alleviate accumulation error if we would like to extend this auto-regressive paradigm to more complex NVS tasks in the future? \n2. Potential ablation study. This paper conducted several ablative studies including sequence order, sampling ratio of latent features, and so on. While the two most important designs are the Stacked-LE and LSTM-GE, this paper does not include ablating them out during training.  So my question is what will happen if we ablate one of them during training? To what extent will they impair the performance? From the current ablative study, I am not clear on the importance of the proposed designs. \n3. Potential metrics. As the method is also capable of extracting meshes, I suppose it is reasonable to also report mesh reconstruction metrics like Chamfer Distance.\n4. More visualized results. I understand this kind of generation task may be hard to assess, but it will be great to see more visualized results or comparisons. Some of the examples do not seem convincing to me like the second example in Fig.8. \n5. Time consumption. Both the training time and inference time can be reported in the revision. \n\nOverall, I would like to see more visualized results, in-the-wild tests, and more ablation studies and comparisons. For now, I still have some concerns about the generalization capability and what matters the most to this method.  I would be glad to raise my rating if my concerns are addressed."
