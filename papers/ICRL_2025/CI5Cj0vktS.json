    "title": "Robust Barycenter Estimation using Semi-Unbalanced Neural Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "A common challenge in aggregating data from multiple sources can be formalized as an *Optimal Transport* (OT) barycenter problem, which seeks to compute the average of probability distributions with respect to OT discrepancies. However, the presence of outliers and noise in the data measures can significantly hinder the performance of traditional statistical methods for estimating OT barycenters. To address this issue, we propose a novel, scalable approach for estimating the *robust* continuous barycenter, leveraging the dual formulation of the *(semi-)unbalanced* OT problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to develop an algorithm for robust barycenters under the continuous distribution setup. \nOur method is framed as a $\\min$-$\\max$ optimization problem and is adaptable to *general* cost function. \nWe rigorously establish the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness to outliers and class imbalance through a number of illustrative experiments.",

The primary method seems to be a combination of barycenter calculation, neural optimal transport, and semi-unbalanced optimal transport. In my view, simply combining methods may not be sufficient for publication at ICLR, so I give a negative score. I will consider raising my score if the authors can demonstrate unique contributions that go beyond a straightforward combination of these methods."

If not, for different proportions or types of noise, different $tau$ is usually required. Will this limit the practicality of the scheme?\n- How does the method work with high-dimensional data? In other words, the support size of the measures may be large in practical applications. While the support size of the measures in your experiments seems rather small.\n- Why don't you compare the methods [1,2] based on robust OT?

The $m$-congruence is a constraint of the problem. So I do not understand why it is written \"if the potentials satisfy the m-congruence, then the optimal value of the SUOT barycenter can be derived by solving (8)\". The SUOT barycenter can always be derived by solving (8) and the potentials necessarily satisfy this constraint when solving (8).\n\nIn Corollary 1, it is stated that the sup is taken over $f_{[1,K]}$. Isn't it also taken over $m$?\n\nIn Theorem 2, equation (12), shouldn't it be an argmin?\n\nIn Section 5.1, it is stated that the UOT problem is equivalent with the OT problem between rescaled distribution. Is it truly equivalent? And could we solve the OT barycenter between the rescaled distributions instead of solving the SUOT barycenter?\n\nIs it proved that $T_{1\\\\#}\\mathbb{P}_1$ gives the UOT barycenter?\n\nI think that the reference [3] is missing.
