    "title": "DynST: Large-Scale Spatial-Temporal Dataset for Transferable Traffic Forecasting with Dynamic Road Networks",
    "abstract": "In real-world traffic networks, it is common to encounter a shortage of historical data in the target region. Researchers often address this issue through transfer learning. However, transfer learning tasks in traffic prediction currently lack dedicated datasets and instead rely on datasets designed for non-transfer prediction tasks. The major drawback of these existing datasets is the adoption of a fixed network topology to model the real world's road networks. This does not align with reality and limits the model's transferability. To tackle this issue, we propose DynST, a dataset specifically designed for transfer learning tasks in traffic prediction, with a massive data volume of 20.35 billion, spanning 20 years and 9 regions. The key feature of DynST is evolving dynamic road network topology, which reflects the evolution of real road networks. Moreover, to address the shortcomings of the distance-based adjacency generation algorithm, we introduce a novel tree-based algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adoption of DynST as the source dataset can significantly enhance the performance of the target region. The comparative experiment also validates that our adjacency matrix generation algorithm can lead to improved prediction accuracy. We believe that DynST, with rich spatial variation information, will facilitate research in the field of transfer traffic prediction.",

The claim made in this paper that \"transfer learning tasks in traffic prediction currently lack dedicated datasets and instead rely on datasets designed for non-transfer prediction tasks\" seems inaccurate. In fact, there are several multi-city traffic datasets that are widely used for cross-city transfer learning research. This statement overlooks existing efforts in the community that already address this issue.\n3. The motivation behind building such a vast traffic dataset spanning 20 years for transfer learning is not clearly justified. For example, the paper does not adequately explain the benefits or rationale for employing such extensive data for transfer learning.\n4. From Table 6, it can be seen that expanding the training data from 1 year to 20 years only provides marginal improvements in the model performance in cross-region prediction scenarios. For instance, the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) improves from 26.34 to 26.31 in the zero-shot setting, and from 21.90 to 20.24 in the 3-day setting, which are relatively small gains considering the significant increase in data volume. While the authors emphasize the scale of DynST as a major contribution, the necessity of utilizing such an enormous dataset is questionable."
