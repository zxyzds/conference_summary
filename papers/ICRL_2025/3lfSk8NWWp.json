    "title": "Unsupervised 2D Molecule Drug-likeness Prediction based on Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "With the research significance and application value, drug-likeness prediction aims to accurately screen high-quality drug candidates, and has attracted increasing attention recently. In this regard, dominant studies can be roughly classified into two categories: (1) Supervised drug-likeness prediction based on binary classifiers. To train classifiers, the common practice is to treat real drugs as positive examples and other molecules as negative ones. However, the manual selection of negative samples introduces classification bias into these classifiers. (2) Unsupervised drug-likeness prediction based on SMILES representations, such as an RNN-based language model trained on real drugs. Nevertheless, using SMILES to represent molecules is suboptimal for drug-likeness prediction, which is more relevant to the topological structures of molecules. Besides, the RNN model tends to assign short-SMILES molecules with high scores, \nregardless of their structures. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation based unsupervised method, which exploits 2D features of molecules for drug-likeness prediction. The teacher model learns the topology of molecules via two pre-training tasks on a large-scale dataset, and the student model mimic the teacher model on real drugs. In this way, the outputs of these two models will be similar on the drug-like molecules while significantly different on the non-drug-like molecules. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct several groups of experiments on various datasets. Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that our method significantly surpasses all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Particularly, the prediction bias of SIMILES length is reduced in our method. We will release our code upon the acceptance of our paper.",

                "value": "The paper presents an unsupervised method for predicting drug-likeness in molecules that exploits 2D features of molecules. It uses a knowledge distillation approach with two models: a \"teacher\" model trained on a large dataset of molecules, which learns molecular topology through tasks like masked atom and bond prediction, and a \"student\" model trained only on real drugs. The student model mimics the teacher\u2019s output on drug-like molecules but diverges on non-drug molecules, allowing for a drug-likeness score based on the difference between the models\u2019 outputs. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing models and is less affected by biases, offering a potentially more accurate way to determine drug likeliness."

                "value": "The main limitations of this work are related to its novelty,  lack of baselines, and limited clarity on its overall positioning. \n- First of all, in the introduction and motivation, the paper distinguishes itself from other unsupervised-based approaches based on the fact that previous work leverages SMILES representations, while this work leverages 2D graphs. However, it is actually possible (and typically done) to compute likelihoods based on 2D graph representations. Indeed, this is typically one of the main ways graph (and molecule) generative methods are evaluated (see, e.g., Diamant et al., 2023 ICML). It is in general well known that for molecular tasks, graph-based representations outperform SMILES-based representations, both for supervised and generative tasks (see, for example, leaderboard https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/). Therefore, using graph-based representations (which have been state-of-the-art for years) instead of SMILES-based representations does not seem to be particularly novel.\n- This paper introduced a self-supervised framework that appears to be very similar to previous work (see \"Evaluating Self-Supervised Learning for Molecular Graph Embeddings\", NeurIPS 2023 for some examples). In this context, the choice of the self-supervised model introduced in this paper appears not novel and arbitrary. \n- This method is framed as novel compared to existing methods based on outlier-based estimation. However, the proposed approach is actually an outlier estimation technique, given that the drug-likeness score is obtained as difference between a model trained on the whole chemical space, and a model trained only on drug-like (i.e., \"known\") molecules. Therefore, more advanced outlier estimation methods should be evaluated.\n\nOverall, it is not clear what the contribution and novelty of this paper is. Additionally, several critical baselines are missing."

The performance of the RNN paper looks great enough according to Table 1, even in the BondError dataset proposed by the authors, the RNN performance is pretty great. I see the main disadvantage of the RNN method is about its bias on the SMILES length. Thus, the authors should proposed some new datasets which contain molecules with different scales of SMILES lengths. Even though the authors showed the comparsion between RNN and their method on different scales of SMILES lengths in Figure 5, which partially address this concern, it's still not that complete. And the authors didn't display the number of molecules for different lengths.\n2. The baseline methods are too weak. The RNN method was way too old. Even the SMILES-BERT was trained 5 years ago. I wonder if the authors would use any transformer for comparison.\n\nThere are some other minor concerns about this paper:\n1. The score is based on atom embedding level, why not consider bond embedding as well?\n2. Be more careful about the potential data leakage problem, even though it might be hard to avoid when there is pretraining stage. Consider scaffold split.\n3. There are two $L_{mam}$ in Formula (1)\n4. Only positive examples are used in the training of the student model, what if introduce some negative examples and perform constrastive learning?"

The baselines include two classes: supervised approaches (QED, a graph neural network (GCN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN)) and unsupervised methods (GlocalKD and HimNet). In four subsets of the FDA-approved drugs dataset, the proposed approach significantly outperforms these baselines. An ablation study is also conducted to examine the contributions of pretraining and distillation, alongside analyses highlighting the RNN\u2019s bias toward shorter drug molecules.
