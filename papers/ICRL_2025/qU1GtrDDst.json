    "abstract": "The accurate forecasting of financial time series remains a significant challenge due to the stochastic nature of the underlying data. To improve prediction accuracy, feature engineering has become a vital aspect of forecasting financial assets. However, engineering features manually often requires domain expertise. We propose to utilise an automated feature generation architecture, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), to generate embeddings as input to improve the performance of downstream financial time series forecasting models. To benchmark the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate forecasting models on predicting the next day's log return on various foreign exchange markets with and without embeddings. Finally, we assess our CPC architecture by employing the same trained encoder on different currency pairs and calculating the Sharpe ratio of our strategies.",

Baseline comparison against existing representation learning method: In order to claim that the proposed method is effective, the author should also consider comparing the proposed method with some existing methods for timeseries representation learning, see corresponding section in literature above. \n\n2. Ablation: The author should conduct ablation study on the pipeline to investigate the critical components that influence the performance. Some examples can be 1) varying model architecture for contrastive learning 2) experiment with different methods to create negative & positive samples for the proposed contrasitive learning method\n\n3. Evaluation metric: \nMarket friction assumption: Can author provide the market friction assumption used during backtesting (such as transaction cost, assumed deviation from position entry, etc.) In addition, could you clarify whether your calculation of return for sharpe involves transaction cost? I ask this because in this type of trading strategy, despite the win-ratio (% profitable trade) might be higher than chance due to certain gain in predictive power, transaction cost could be very high and potentially eat up all the profit. This should be taken care of because the baseline, buy-and-hold, completes in two transactions. \n\nSome other financial metrics to consider: max drawdown, sortino ratio. This gives the reader another perspective of the strategy from risk perspective.\n\nAnother note is that it seems like a position can be short only. If this is true, It would be helpful to provide margin needed at anytime just to be practical. \n\n4. Size of dataset: Since the test conducted was only 20% of three currency timeseries. It would be helpful to backtest on more currency timeseries or other asset timeseries. This is to make sure the arrived results are statistically significant. \n\nAdditional Comment\n1. Figure 6: It is not convincing that this plot shows the effectiveness of produced embedding. Essentially the unsupervised classes are plotted. Then, it is expected that the boundary from k-mean should be clear. The author should conduct some analysis on each cluster to see if there are unique properties for each of them. \n\n2. lowest error rate with zero and mean model: It would be helpful for the author to provide more insights here. For example, does this suggest the forecasting method are worse than trivial baseline? If justified using mean-reverting property, can you show us that a forecasting model with mean-reverting behavior-forecast work well?"

Given the limitations of traditional models in handling the noisy, stochastic nature of financial data, the authors benchmark CPC embeddings against both complex (LSTM) and simpler models (linear regression, persistence) on currency pairs like USDJPY, USDSGD, and EURGBP. Results demonstrate that CPC-enhanced models, especially linear regression, outperform traditional approaches, indicating that CPC can produce robust, generalizable features suitable for diverse currency pairs. Additionally, the study finds that CPC-based strategies yield higher Sharpe ratios than a buy-and-hold approach, suggesting CPC\u2019s potential in developing adaptive trading strategies across financial markets."

The paper evaluates CPC embeddings not just on a single currency but across multiple currency pairs (USDJPY, USDSGD, EURGBP), demonstrating an effort to test its adaptability. This cross-domain testing shows that the embeddings have the potential to capture broader, generalizable patterns, although more rigorous experimentation would solidify this claim."

The sole methodological addition is the custom negative sampling based on the Black-Scholes model, which does not sufficiently advance. More substantial methodological innovation would be required for a contribution of significance.\n2. The experimental scope is limited and omits comparisons with current state-of-the-art models for time series forecasting, such as iTransformer, PatchTST, and DLinear. Additionally, the paper does not benchmark CPC against recent self-supervised learning models tailored for time series data, like TimeDRL, TS2Vec, or TS-TCC. This lack of comparative analysis weakens the results\u2019 credibility and makes it difficult to assess the true efficacy of the proposed approach.\n3. The paper suffers from organizational and formatting issues, which detract from clarity and professionalism. Notably, the references do not adhere to the ICLR format, and sections are structured in an unconventional manner. For instance, the Related Work section should be distinct, and the Methodology section includes experimental details that would be better placed in a separate Experiments section. Improved structure and adherence to standard formatting would enhance the paper's readability and alignment with conference expectations."

Many models support probabilistic forecasting, such as estimating parametric distributions or quantiles\u2014have the authors considered approaches like Bayesian neural networks or ensemble methods to quantify prediction uncertainty within the CPC framework?"

Additionally, there is missing information in citation 11, which should be completed to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n3, It is unclear why the authors assume that using only the closing price as a feature is sufficient for model development. Stock prices are highly sensitive to external factors such as news, events, and economic indices. Relying solely on the closing price may lead to underfitting. If this risk exists, the authors should explain how they have addressed it.\n\n4,The validation process relies exclusively on the Sharpe Ratio to assess the model\u2019s performance. However, for a probabilistic forecasting model, additional evaluation metrics are required, such as point-wise measures (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and distributional similarity metrics (e.g., Wasserstein Distance).

I think this is more of a necessary condition rather than sufficient. The paper would be much stronger if convincing arguments are provided on why CPC is a good choice for tackling stochasticity and why is preferable w.r.t. other unsupervised representation learning methods.\n\n- The contextualization of this paper within the current literature is very poor. Only 3 references are provided in the literature review section: CPC, an application to anomaly detection, and an LSTM-based architecture. Overall, only 11 references are provided. I think the paper would benefit from a better presentation, up to recent works, of time series unsupervised representation learning [1] and forecasting [2], preferably discussing relevance to the financial domain.\n\n- The presentation and organization of the paper\u2019s content is very poor. A considerable portion of the paper (~3 pages in total) is dedicated to presenting naive baselines and details about the standard ML pipeline (preprocessing, normalization, windowing, train/test split), while all the important figures, describing the architecture and presenting the main results, are piled in the Appendix with minimal text. I think the authors should consider moving to the main text all tables/plots that they believe are relevant to support their claims.\n\n-  The learned embeddings are only evaluated in conjunction with linear regression, which severely limits the impact of the work, especially given the targeted venue.\n\n- The paper claims LSTMs struggling to learn from the considered dataset and being outperformed by linear regression and naive baselines (Sec. 3.2-3.3-3.4). However, Figure 7 (in Appendix) is the only result supporting this. Furthermore, the experimental pipeline does not consider a validation set for early stopping and model selection, which is arguably fundamental for deep architectures. Given the sensitivity of the paper's claim, I think it should be supported with more empirical evidence, e.g., learning curve, hyperparameter optimization.\n\nMinor\n- There are some inconsistencies in the notation. For example, $x_t$ is found on both sides of Eq.2;  notation is inconsistent between Eqs.1-2 and between Eqs. 3-4-5-6. \n\n- The definition of the CPC-LR acronym is missing.\n\n- Figure presentation could be improved, e.g., all plots in Fig. 8 are missing axis labels; captions are very concise; text in Fig.3-5-7 is small. \n\n- The paper might benefit from a more gentle introduction to some domain-specific terminology, e.g., allocations, buy-and-hold, return plots."
