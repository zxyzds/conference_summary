    "title": "A Skewness-Based Criterion for Addressing Heteroscedastic Noise in Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \\sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose \\texttt{SkewScore}, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of \\texttt{SkewScore} in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

As a reviewer, this summary enables me to track the advancements in the field and understand the recent progress. \n\n3. The core idea behind the proposed method is simple and intuitive, based on the asymmetry of score skewness to identify causal directions. This approach is conceptually accessible and computationally efficient solutions. \n\n4.

                "value": "1. The paper provides correctness guarantees only for the two-variable case, where skewness in the score function can reliably distinguish causal directions. However, for settings with more than two variables, there is no formal guarantee of correctness for Algorithm 1. \n\n2. Current empirical results seem insufficient in showcasing its performance in high-dimensional scenarios. In other words, it remains unclear whether SkewScore scales effectively as the number of variables grows significantly. \n\n3. While the authors claim robustness in the presence of latent confounders, this robustness appears to be limited to simple bivariate cases. In multivariate settings, SkewScore can still produce incorrect causal graphs when latent confounders are present. For instance, in the causal structure $X_1 \\rightarrow X_2 \\rightarrow X_3$ with a latent confounder $L$ influencing both $X_1$ and $X_3$ ($X_1 \\leftarrow L \\rightarrow X_3$), the method would infer the structure $X_1 \\rightarrow X_2 \\rightarrow X_3$ along with a spurious direct link $X_1 \\rightarrow X_3$. This incorrect edge arises because the latent confounder $L$ induces a conditional dependence between $X_1$ and $X_3$, which SkewScore interprets as a direct causal link. As a result, while the method can handle some latent confounding, it does not offer sufficient mechanisms to detect and mitigate confounding in more complex structures, limiting its application in practical scenarios where latent variables are common."

What are the effects of small sample sizes on SkewScore\u2019s performance? It would be great if authors can discuss the convergence guarantee of the algorithm in terms of the size of samples. \n\n4.

Specifically, the author showed that the skewness of the score function (SkewScore) in the $X_i$-coordinate is zero if and only if $X_i$ is a leaf node under certain assumptions. Therefore, the topological order can be identified by iteratively removing the variables with the least SkewScore. Conditional independence tests are then applied to determine the edges. Its validity for the HSNM with latent confounder is also discussed. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method is effective on HSNMs and is robust to assumption violations."
