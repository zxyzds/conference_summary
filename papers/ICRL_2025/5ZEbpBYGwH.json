    "abstract": "Combining data from different sources can improve data analysis tasks such as clustering. However, most of the current multi-view clustering methods are limited to specific domains or rely on a suboptimal and computationally intensive two-stage process of representation learning and clustering. We propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework for general data types (such as images and tables). Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Cluster assignments are learned by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound on the error caused by incorrect pseudo-labels in the unsupervised representations compared to LDA. Extensive experiments on ten multi-view clustering benchmark datasets provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

For different datasets, the proposed method has different settings of model architecture and batch size. Moreover, in D.4 GRADUAL TRAINING, the training epochs in each step are determined by human. Since we have no labelled data to tune the model settings in practical applications, the proposed might have limited practical application value."
