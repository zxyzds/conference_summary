    "title": "EarthquakeNPP: Benchmark Datasets for Earthquake Forecasting with Neural Point Processes",
    "abstract": "Classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes for decades. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark dataset for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community since it lacks a key earthquake sequence from the region and improperly splits training and testing data. Furthermore, initial earthquake forecast benchmarking lacks a comparison to state-of-the-art earthquake forecasting models typically used by the seismological community. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by a credible implementation of the ETAS model. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. In a benchmarking experiment, we compare three spatio-temporal NPPs against ETAS and find that none outperform ETAS in either spatial or temporal log-likelihood. These results indicate that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. However, EarthquakeNPP will serve as a platform for collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities with the goal of improving earthquake predictability.",

The authors evaluate some state-of-the-art NPP-based models against ETAS and have identified that these models demonstrate comparable temporal performance with the ETAS  model. Based on their analysis, the authors note that NPP-based models do not have a direct dependence on magnitude, in contrast to ETAS."

Standardizing the evaluation method by comparing against the ETAS method that is used in the real world is a good idea.\n\n**Significance**: The dataset collection created by the authors can serve as a benchmark for future research in NPP-based earthquake forecasting models. The authors have highlighted the limitations of existing benchmark datasets and why they need to be improved. \n\n**Experiments**: The authors have also provided initial assessments of state-of-the-art NPP-based models and highlighted the limitations of existing methods."

A table highlighting the differences/limitations, or better defining the categories would help. For instance, \"benchmarking efforts by NPP/ML community\" , \"benchmarking efforts by seismology community\" etc. The existing benchmark dataset can then go into the first category. \n2. Section 5: Since each of the three tests is aimed at evaluating the temporal, spatial, and magnitude components of the forecast, renaming section 5.1 to \"temporal test\" is suggested.\n3. Section 3 is better summarized as a table and includes additional information such as the number of training, validation, and test data. (This is currently included in the anon. github README). Additionally, the strengths/weaknesses/challenges of each dataset can be elucidated in this format, allowing the user to understand how each dataset is different from the other.\n4. From the title, it seems as if the dataset is purely for benchmarking NPP-based methods, which might narrow the scope of the dataset. What needs to be done to generalize it for other methods capable of generating log-likelihoods such as bayesian inferencing-based methods?"

Including a comparison of model complexity of the NPP-based models vs ETAS models in the evaluation metrics would be of great importance."

Have you conducted any computational complexity analysis, such as comparing the training times between the baseline and NPPs? If you have other ways to present the computational cost, please include them as well.\n\n(2) This work lacks sufficient detail on the reproducibility of experimental results, which may affect other researchers' ability to replicate the study. For instance, issues with the division of training and testing data in the existing NPPs benchmark dataset may prevent an accurate reproduction of real operational environments. Additionally, the interpretation of experimental results relies heavily on statistical data, lacking an in-depth analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms."
