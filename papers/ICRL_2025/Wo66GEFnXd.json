    "title": "Learning Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory via Geometry and Physics Aware Latent Evolution",
    "abstract": "We consider using machine learning to simulate time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to predict physical properties of molecules and materials beyond their ground states. In particular, by simulating the electronic response of the system under an external electromagnetic field, the optical absorption spectrum can be calculated using real-time TDDFT (RT-TDDFT), which provides physical information about the excited states and dipole strength function. However, RT-TDDFT simulation requires the direct propagation of electronic wavefunctions of all valence electrons for extended periods, making the process very time-consuming. In this work, we model electron density as volumetric data and train neural networks to map between coarse time steps. To make the model aware of the atomistic environment, we incorporate 3D message passing into the model architecture. Additionally, we use latent evolution to regularize the model towards learning the underlying physics. Our method is termed TDDFTNet. To evaluate our approach, we generate datasets using molecules from the MD17 dataset. Results show that TDDFTNet can learn the time propagation of electron densities accurately and efficiently.",

                "value": "The authors propose a new approach to accelerating RT-TDDFT simulations using machine learning. The authors design a novel neural network architecture called TDDFTNet that incorporates the 3D geometry of the molecule and uses a latent evolution approach to model the changes in electron density over time. The novelty of this method stems from the message passing architecture and time evolution in a physics-aware latent space. The method is evaluated on datasets of molecules from the MD17 dataset and shows promising results in accurately predicting the evolution of electron density and the optical absorption spectrum."

Can TDDFTNet be extended to study other excited state dynamics, such as those induced by different types of perturbations or those involving non-adiabatic transitions? Can we incorporate perturbation parameters or a continuously time dependent external potential in the model?

                "value": "### Originality\n*I am not quite familiar with the recent literature on RT-TDDFT simulations. My reference comes from the `Related Work` section of this paper.*\n1. The authors proposed an ML-based approach for RT-TDDFT simulations by discretizing the electronic density as volumetric data to simplify the representation of electron density as opposed to using basis sets in popular quantum chemistry theories.\n1. The authors integrated message-passing for training TDDFTNet to model atomistic interactions.\n1. The current literature on RT-TDDFT simulations is limited and this work provides a novel approach to address the challenges in RT-TDDFT simulations.\n\n### Quality\n1. The authors provided a detailed description of the problem setting and method in sections 3 and 4. Figure 2 is particularly helpful in representing the architecture of TDDFTNet.\n1. The experiments and shown results are detailed and well-organized. The authors compared the performance of TDDFTNet on three molecules and compared the results with the ground truth from first-principle calculations by Octopus, an RT-TDDFT simulation software.\n\n### Clarity\n1. The paper is detailed in introducing the problem setting, method, the chosen experiment, and presenting the results.\n\n### Significance\n1. RT-TDDFT simulations are computationally expensive with first-principle calculations. Yet they are crucial for simulating molecules and modeling various physical properties. An efficient ML-based approach like TDDFTNet is significant for screening molecules and accelerating discoveries.\n1. The TDDFTNet model is a good starting point for further research in RT-TDDFT simulations with ML."

                "value": "**The training and evaluation were done with the same molecules.**\n- The authors chose three molecules, water, malondialdehyde, and ethanol, from the MD17 dataset. For each molecule, 1600 geometries were sampled for training.\n- However, the results of the optical absorption spectra and predicted dipoles were reported on the same three molecules. Even though the reported results could be from a different set of geometries, this still brings concerns about information leakage and generalization of the model to unseen molecules.\n- To address this, the authors could introduce two other sets of experiments:\n    1. Use different sizes for the training set geometry samples and evaluate the model on the same three molecules. For example, report the performance when training with 200, 400, 800, and 1600 geometries per molecule. If similar accuracy can be achieved with fewer samples, then TDDFTNet could still be useful even if it suffers generalization issues.\n    1. Train the model on one set of molecules and evaluate it on another set of molecules.\n\n**The discretization of the electronic density as volumetric data limits the scalability of the model.**\n- The results shown are for three small molecules and the authors did not discuss the scalability of the model to larger molecules.\n- For larger molecules, the discretization of the electronic density as volumetric data could be computationally expensive and may not be feasible since large molecules come with larger volumes.\n- In addition, the volumetric representation brings concern with the grid size/fidelity of the representation. The authors should discuss the impact of the grid size on the performance of TDDFTNet."

How does TDDFTNet generalize to unseen molecules? Could the authors provide results on the generalization of TDDFTNet to unseen molecules?\n1. Is the TDDFTNet model scalable to larger molecules such as toluene, caffeine, or even larger molecules? How does the volumetric representation of the electronic density impact the scalability of TDDFTNet to larger molecules?\n1.
