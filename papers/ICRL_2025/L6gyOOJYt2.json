    "abstract": "In recommender systems, selection bias arises from the users' selective interactions with items, which poses a widely-recognized challenge for unbiased evaluation and learning for recommendation models. Recently, doubly robust and its variants have been widely studied to achieve debiased learning of prediction models. However, if the users and items in the training set are not exactly the same as those in the test set, even if the imputed errors and learned propensities are accurate, all previous doubly robust based debiasing methods are biased. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we first derive the bias of doubly robust learning methods and provide alternative unbiasedness conditions when users and items are sampled from a superpopulation. Then we propose a novel superpopulation doubly robust target learning approach (SuperDR), which is unbiased when either the imputation model or propensity model is correctly specified. We further derive the generalization error bound of the proposed method under superpopulation, and show that it can be effectively controlled by the proposed target learning approach. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, including a large-scale industrial dataset, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

                "value": "W1: The writing of the paper seems somewhat hasty, with some key details missing and some descriptions challenging to understand. Here are some examples:\n* In Section 1, critical undescribed content is why existing debiased recommendation methods must be unbiased in a train-test setting with the same set of users and items. Based on the current description, it is not intuitive.\n\n* For Section 4.1, why, in a general scenario, does the learned imputed error or propensity estimate become the expectation? It is also not intuitive. In Section 2, the authors also mentioned that this work extends the previous methods for deterministic error imputation and propensity models to probabilistic ones. This is hard to understand.\n\n* In Section 4.2, the imputation balance correction calculation process is unclear. For example, what does $m$ mean? Is $\\epsilon$ a value? What are the meanings of the two terms of this imputation balance correction? Why does it achieve the desired control process?\n\n* What is the meaning of the superscript Bal used in many losses?\n\n* No description is provided for the division of the data set in the experiment.\n\n* In Section 5.1, MF generates embeddings for each user and item, which are then used as their features in MLP. The rationality of this process is questioned.\n\nW2: The motivation proposed may not be convincing enough. In real-world scenarios, it is rare to directly use a model trained on user (or item) set A to predict user (or item) set B. This is inherently risky because the embeddings of external users (or items) are completely random and unlearned. In fact, if SuperDR does not use a pre-trained recommendation model (such as MF) to obtain a set of well-trained user and item embeddings in the experiment, I think it will also encounter this problem.\n\nW3: The core contribution of the proposed solution compared to existing work is introducing an optimization process that controls covariance. However, there is a lack of more in-depth analysis, and the overall contribution is not significant enough.\n* In Section 4.1, the bias term consists of two parts. Although the first part (i.e., covariance) is repeatedly emphasized, it is unclear how the second part is optimized in SuperDR.\n\n* From an intuitive point of view, why does controlling for covariance help correct estimates of external populations? What is the connection between them?\n\n* Based on Algorithm 1, SuperDR does not make many major changes to the DR architecture. This makes people worry that it may not have much gain compared to DR in some cases. In fact, based on the results in Table 1, we can find that its gain is indeed marginal, especially on some larger datasets. In addition, the pre-optimization process for covariance seems difficult, which may cause unstable training in some scenarios.\n\nW4: The current experiments are not sufficiently powerful and have many limitations.\n* As described in the previous concern, the process of generating features for users and items is somewhat unusual.\n\n* In real scenarios, there is much feature information besides user and item IDs. It is unknown how they can be applied to SuperDR.\n\n* Considering that current recommendation systems contain many representative architectures, using only a simple MLP as a skeleton model is flawed and lacks applicability.\n\n* Debiased recommendation is a hot research topic with many recent works. Some newer methods (e.g. published in 2024) should be included as baselines."

                "value": "This paper introduces Superpopulation Doubly Robust Target Learning (SuperDR), a method designed to address selection bias in recommendation systems when training and test data are sampled from a larger superpopulation with limited overlap. SuperDR extends traditional Doubly Robust (DR) methods by incorporating probabilistic imputation and propensity models to better handle uncertainty and variability across superpopulation samples. A key innovation in this approach is the inclusion of a covariance control mechanism within the loss function, which aims to reduce bias by minimizing the empirical covariance between imputation and propensity errors. Theoretical analysis suggests that controlling this covariance can help mitigate bias under superpopulation conditions, and the authors provide a generalization error bound to support this approach. Experiments on several recommendation datasets demonstrate that SuperDR outperforms traditional DR methods and other baselines, particularly in settings where train and test sets have limited overlap in user-item pairs."

SuperDR specifically addresses scenarios where the training and test sets differ, which is common in real-world recommendation systems as user bases and item inventories evolve. \n\n__Covariance Control to Address Bias from Imputation and Propensity Correlations__:\nA major technical contribution is the introduction of a covariance control term within the loss function, which is designed to minimize empirical covariance between errors in propensity score estimation and imputed errors. In superpopulation contexts, these two types of errors can correlate, introducing additional bias in the DR estimator. By actively controlling this covariance, SuperDR reduces the bias resulting from these correlations, making the estimator more robust in settings with non-overlapping samples. \n\n__Solid theoretical and Empirical Support for the Proposed Adjustments__:\nThe paper offers strong theoretical validation by deriving a generalization error bound using concentration inequalities. This bound supports SuperDR\u2019s robustness claims under superpopulation sampling. Empirically, SuperDR is tested across several recommendation datasets and demonstrates improvements over traditional DR methods and other baselines. The ablation studies prove the effectiveness of the variance reduction techniques proposed."

The paper\u2019s statement oversimplifies the requirements for unbiasedness in DR estimation. In fact, DR methods do not require an _exact_ match between the users and items in the training and test sets. It might ask for positivity and overlap of supports [1] although an exact match surely satisfy this requirement. \n\nThe paper claims the added correction has no harm, while it is theoretically correct in the case of the empirically covariance drops to zero. However, in practical scenarios, where exact zero empirical covariance is challenging to achieve due to model imperfections, \ud835\udf16 may not fully converge to zero and could introduce slight adjustments, potentially affecting the \"no harm\" property.\n\n__The presentation of this paper can be improved__:\nThe lack of indexing in key formulas, especially when dealing with complex constructs like superpopulation, covariance terms, and probabilistic models, makes the paper harder to follow.\n\nThe paper has solid theoretical foundations, but it could benefit from more intuition and clearer explanations on why certain choices (like probabilistic models and covariance control) are necessary. The presentation would be stronger if it provided a more intuitive context for readers to understand how the superpopulation setting is motivated.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Off-policy Bandits with Deficient Support, Noveen Sachdeva, Yi Su, Thorsten Joachims, KDD 20"
