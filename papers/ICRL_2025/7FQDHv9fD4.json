    "title": "Decomposing heterogeneous dynamical systems with graph neural networks",
    "abstract": "Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show that graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the structure of the heterogeneity from data alone. The learned latent structure and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of moving particles and vector fields that interact with each other. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.",

The closest thing I can find to a definition is \"The latent heterogeneity of the particles is encoded by a two-dimensional learnable embedding $a_i$ that is part of the node features.\" But why two?\n- The simulation of dynamic systems has been routinely done by GNNs, most notably Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020, as cited in the paper. The only difference seems to be that they do not consider this \"heterogeneity\" whose definition is not clear? But does this method introduced here even outperform the baselines without such input?\n- This paper uses a very classical method that is not equivariant on 3-dimensional space. How does it deal with rotational equivariance?\n- There is no baseline nor quantitative comparison.\n- No code is provided."

Several ODE/FDE-based GNNs, such as Continuous Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), have leveraged this approach to simulate time-evolving, interacting components in these systems. While the authors mention using simple MLPs instead of differentiable functions, it remains unclear what advantages MLPs offer over ODE-based methods. A discussion on this aspect would clarify the benefits of MLPs in the proposed approach and strengthen the novelty claim. Is it possible to provide a comparative analysis between their MLP-based approach and ODE-based methods like CGNNs, and also discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages in terms of computational efficiency, expressiveness, or ease of implementation? \n\nLack of experiments over real data: While the approach is tested on simulated data, it lacks validation on real-world data observed in natural systems. This limitation raises concerns about the method\u2019s practical effectiveness and generalizability to real-world dynamics, where noise and complexities may differ significantly from simulations. Including experiments with real data would strengthen the evidence for the approach\u2019s applicability, for example, applying the proposed method to data from physical experiments, biological systems, or social networks is more convincing."
