    "title": "Generating Multi-Modal and Multi-Attribute Single-Cell Counts with CFGen",
    "abstract": "Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data has proven instrumental for tasks like trajectory inference, batch effect removal, and gene expression generation. However, the most recent deep generative models simulating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, overlooking the discrete nature of single-cell data, which limits their effectiveness and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Additionally, aspects like controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation of cellular data are underexplored. This work introduces Cell Flow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model that accounts for the discrete nature of single-cell data. CFGen generates whole-genome multimodal single-cell counts reliably, improving the recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while tackling relevant generative tasks such as rare cell type augmentation and batch correction. We also introduce a novel framework for compositional data generation using Flow Matching. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.",

                "value": "This paper proposes CFGen, which is a latent flow-matching generative model for single-cell data, where the latent space is first learned by an autoencoder. To capture statistical properties specific to single-cell data, the autoencoders learn to decode the parameters of a negative binomial distribution and Bernoulli distribution, for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, respectively. Conditional generation is achieved through classifier guidance. Empirical results demonstrate that CFGen outperform other single-cell generative models in terms of (1) data generation to approximate the real data distribution, (2) data generation for rare cell type classification, and (3) batch correction."

The change in MMD and WD with respect to the target distribution when increasing guidance strength can suffice."

Single cell data is generally sparse, noisy, and has high feature variance. The authors suggest a flow matching based approach as a more expressive, and consistent generative model compared to VAEs, and GANs for generating synthetic cells. They also present a compositional variant of classifier-free guidance for flow-based models to allow conditioning on various attributes. Finally, they evaluate the model on two downstream tasks: (1) generating synthetic samples of rare cell-types and using them for data-augmentation,  (2) leveraging CFGen for batch correction."

Secondly, what are the red points representing? I also suggest perhaps adding a quantitative metric (perhaps a oracle model that predicts the attributes) as well.\n2. I also suggest removing the bars from Fig. 2b as they make it hard to observe the overlapping density curves which are easier to infer from.\n3. For Sec 5.2, it might be worthwhile to also add a comparison with CFGen just trained on RNA-data in order to measure the effects of using multimodal data for training.\n4. A comparison of inference times might also be useful in this case, especially to compare scDiffusion and CFGen, since both require multiple time steps. Adding approximate training times for each of the comparable models would also be valuable.\n5. Fig.4 should also report the raw accuracy numbers for each of the cell-types to evaluate the effect of CFGen,"

But there is a plethora of methods that make use of negative binomial (or alternatives like poisson distribution) to handle count data as well as over-dispersion. So why should it be listed as a contribution of this paper?\n- According to the paper, \"... the proposed factorisation is novel\". In the factorisation of Eq. 5 what is the rational behind conditioning the latent factor z on library size?\n- In proposition 1, the attributes $y_1$, $y_2$, ... are assumed to be conditionally independent given $z$, but with the factorisation of Eq. 5 the attributes are connected to $z$, hence $z$ forms a V-structure which according to d-separation causes the attributes to be dependant given $z$ ?\n- Regarding the proposed guidance scheme, the only difference to the normal classifier-free guidance is that only some attributes (and one attribute during training) is fed to the decoder. Is this approach equivalent to the normal classifier-free guidance with all attributes plus some attributes being randomly dropped out? Even if so, it wouldn't decrease the value of the proposed method.\n- In Table 1 scDiffusion is heavily outperformed by the proposed method, but one may say diffusion models may perform on par with flow matching (apart from training stability etc.). In the paper I'd recommend providing an explanation for the superior performance of the proposed method compared to scDiffusion."
