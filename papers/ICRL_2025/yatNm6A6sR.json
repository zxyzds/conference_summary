    "abstract": "Road network data can provide rich information about cities and thus become the base for various urban research. However, processing large-volume world-wide road network data requires intensive computing resources and the processed results might be different to be unified for benchmark downstream tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we process the OpenStreetMap data and release a structured world-wide 1-billion-node road network graph database with high accessibility and usability. We have presented three illustrative use cases, traffic prediction task, city boundary detection task and traffic policy control task. Moreover, for the well-investigated traffic prediction task, we release a new benchmark with 31 datasets, which is much more comprehensive than the previously frequently-used datasets. While for the relatively novel traffic policy control task, we release a new 6 city datasets with much larger scale than the previous datasets. Along with the OSM+ dataset, the release of data converters facilitates the integration of multimodal spatial-temporal data based on map information for large model training, thereby expediting the process of uncovering compelling scientific insights.",

The results for the other two use cases are overly simplistic. More detailed methods and comprehensive results are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of OSM+ in these applications.

                "value": "1. The paper uses varying terms like system, framework, and engine to describe the proposed work, which makes it confusing for me to identify differences between them.\n\n2. The frequent use of the term \"efficient\" throughout the text lacks evidence (i.e., experiments) to support it.\n\n3. Figure 4 is not referenced in the main text.\n\n4. Some logical flow issues arise, such as in Section 4.1: \"However, in recent years, it has been noticed that newly proposed methods can hardly exhibit significant improvements over existing ones. Thus, we are here to propose 31 new city-level datasets.\" Introducing new datasets does not necessarily address marginal improvements in existing methods. Additionally, the main motivation for proposing a large number of datasets seems to be to highlight their dynamic and sparse characteristics. However, there is no statistical evidence demonstrating how sparsity varies between cities compared to classic datasets like PEMS and METR.\n\n5. The spatial and temporal spans of the 31 traffic flow datasets are not clearly outlined, nor is the process for data collection (e.g., traffic flow data) explained.\n\n6. The traffic policy control experiment lacks clarity, and no results for this experiment are presented in the main text.\n\n7. Overall, the experiments section offers limited insights that might benefit future research, aside from the city boundary detection task. The findings in the city boundary detection task seem only loosely related to the system\u2019s contributions. It's unclear how this system differs from existing ones in identifying correlations between road networks and socio-economic indicators.\n\n8. Each contribution mentioned by the authors is not sufficiently addressed:\n- Data-wise: How is this data different from typical OSM data? If efficiency is a key feature of the proposed system, efficiency experiments should be included in the main experiments.\n- System-wise: The system\u2019s uniqueness compared to other systems is not clearly articulated.\n- Application-wise: The definition and scope of applications, such as traffic signal control, are not clearly explained.\n- Benchmark-wise: The motivation behind the benchmark and the relevant dataset statistics are missing."

My understanding is that such graph data could be obtained relatively easily using the OSM API and packages like NetworkX. Are there any specific procedures designed for processing this graph data? For example, how many subgraphs are there? Did the authors merge different subgraphs or make other efforts to refine this data?\n4. Could the authors clarify the traffic policy control experiment?"
