    "title": "StreamingBench: Assessing the Gap for MLLMs to Achieve Streaming Video Understanding",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities from image comprehension to video understanding. However, most of these MLLMs focus primarily on of\ufb02ine video comprehension, necessitating extensive processing of all video frames before any queries can be made. This presents a signi\ufb01cant gap compared to the human ability to watch, listen, think, and respond to streaming inputs in real time, highlighting the limitations of current MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce StreamingBench, the \ufb01rst comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the streaming video understanding capabilities of MLLMs. StreamingBench assesses three core aspects of streaming video understanding: (1) real-time visual understanding, (2) omni-source understanding and (3) contextual understanding. The benchmark consists of 18 tasks, featuring 900 videos and 4,500 human-curated QA pairs. Each video features \ufb01ve questions presented at different time points to simulate a continuous streaming scenario. We conduct experiments on StreamingBench with 15 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and \ufb01nd that even the most advanced proprietary MLLMs like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o perform signi\ufb01cantly below human-level streaming video understanding capabilities. We hope our work can facilitate further advancements for MLLMs, empowering them to approach human-level video comprehension and interaction in more realistic scenarios.",

For instance, whenever a question arises, the model can process all frames up to that timestamp. With this approach, the benchmark may not differ significantly from traditional video benchmarks. Therefore, it is essential for this benchmark to identify scenarios that cannot be simplified to an offline setting.\n\n- While handling redundant information is indeed critical for video LLMs, this challenge is not exclusive to streaming scenarios; it is a general issue for any long-video task. As a result, the insights from this paper may be overshadowed by findings from benchmarks specifically focused on long-video understanding.\n\n- The annotation process lacks clarity. Specifically, how do human annotators manually label QA pairs for omni-source understanding and other contextual understanding tasks? What measures are in place to ensure the quality of each question, and what specific strategies were employed?"

Traditional MLLMs are effective in offline video comprehension but struggle with real-time, streaming scenarios that require instant processing, synchronizing visual and audio inputs, and understanding context over time. StreamingBench addresses this by presenting 900 videos across diverse real-world scenarios, structured into 18 tasks and 4,300 human-curated question-answer pairs. These tasks test MLLMs on real-time visual, omni-source, and contextual understanding, aiming to bridge the gap between MLLMs and human-level comprehension in streaming contexts. Testing 13 MLLMs, including state-of-the-art proprietary models, revealed significant limitations in current models, especially in omni-source and contextual tasks, suggesting that MLLMs need further development to match human performance in real-time understanding. In general, it is a solid paper and I would recommend acceptance to it."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The real-time understanding part is nice, but seems a little bit trivial. From all kinds of NIAH evaluations, all models can best answer questions near the ending part of the input, and questions related to \"current moments\" (which is actually the ending part of input as implemented) might not be so important. Would love to see the understanding on \"remembering earlier moments\" and the discrepancy from \"current moments\" for LMMs.\n\n2. The omni-source (visual+audio) part is good. However, how are LMMs without audio abilities evaluated? As these `audio'-related questions seem to be mostly about speeches, do authors plan to interleave text ASR into the model for evaluation? At present, sadly we only see a black-box Gemini-1.5-Pro (for which we do not know how they integrate audio and video) being evaluated with audio.\n\n3. A minor suggestion: the omnisource part of the benchmark is related to \"referring reasoning\" part of LongVideoBench, an interleaved benchmark for frames and ASR texts, which also needs to judge between concurrent video and audio information in a video. As some other long video benchmarks discussed in Tab 1, please also try to discuss it in the revised paper."

I believe this is a crucial factor in streaming video understanding. It would be more consistent and fair to have a fixed memory limit applied across all models, as retaining all input frames throughout a task\u2014particularly in real-world applications\u2014may not be feasible. If some models retain all frames, it could lead to an unfair advantage."
