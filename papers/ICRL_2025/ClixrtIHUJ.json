    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of class incremental learning (CIL) within the broader context of continual learning. In CIL, a system learns a sequence of tasks or classes incrementally. The resulting classifier can categorize test samples into any learned class thus far without relying on task-specific information during testing. CIL presents two significant challenges: catastrophic forgetting (CF) and inter-task class separation (ICS). ICS occurs because the system lacks data from previous tasks when learning new ones, making it harder to establish decision boundaries between classes, reducing accuracy. This paper proposes a novel method to overcome both CF and ICS. The basic classifier is based on the statistical technique Mahalanobis distance (MD), which measures the distance of a data point to a normal distribution. In the proposed approach, each class is represented by a normal distribution with the mean and covariance derived from the features of its training data, which are extracted from a language model (LM). To reduce storage, all classes share a common covariance matrix. Two additional techniques are also proposed to enhance the accuracy: (1) using a kernel function to expand the feature space, and (2) incorporating an ensemble mechanism. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to the upper bound accuracy of joint fine-tuning, which, to our knowledge, has not been achieved before.",

However, I see the reliance on pre-trained language models and the realism of the CIL setup as the main weaknesses of this paper.\n\n**1. Reliance on Pre-trained Models and Realism of the CIL Setup**\n\nThe paper depends on the availability of a pre-trained language model, with the assumption that this model provides sufficient discriminative power to separate classes in the CIL task. The findings suggest that the pre-trained model has the knowledge required for the tasks, reducing the continual learning challenge to already separable features. I think this setup lacks realism, as CIL should ideally focus on teaching new knowledge to the model, e.g., different types of tail knowledge as tasks. It is unclear when to use the proposed pre-trained model as feature extractor and when to apply fine-tuning to teach new knowledge. I wonder would it defeat the purpose of continual learning if the model already has that knowledge.\n\n**2. Upper Bound Baseline**\n\nThe experiments refer to joint fine-tuning over the full language model as the upper bound baseline. I believe a stronger upper bound would be the proposed ensemble of kernel Mahalanobis distance, based on the full training data. Fine-tuning the parameters of language models introduces technical complexities that might impact performance, especially if the model already has the knowledge."

                "value": "1. My main concern is the rationale for freezing the network. This prevents the model from adapting to new data, turning incremental learning into merely an update of inference rules (prototypes) rather than the model\u2019s knowledge. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the alignment between pretrained knowledge and downstream tasks, which may not hold in real-world scenarios. Significant gaps between incremental tasks and pretrained knowledge would still require model parameter adjustments.\n2. This also raises concerns about the fairness of the experimental evaluation. Table 1 shows that simple NCM and MD approaches achieve performance close to the upper bound, suggesting strong generalization from the pretrained model. This reduces the necessity of incremental learning on these datasets. The authors should consider applying incremental learning to tasks that pose more generalization challenges.\n3. Lastly, the methodological novelty is limited. Classification using MD is common, enhancing it with kernel functions is also a standard practice. Therefore, the innovation of this method is limited."
