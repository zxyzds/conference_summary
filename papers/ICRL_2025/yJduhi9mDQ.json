    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the cornerstone of modern machine\nlearning applications, achieving impressive results in domains ranging from com-\nputer vision to autonomous systems. However, their dependence on extensive data\nand computational resources exposes them to vulnerabilities such as backdoor\nattacks, where poisoned samples can lead to erroneous model outputs. To counter\nthese threats, we introduce a defense strategy called H\u00f6lder Pruning to detect\nand eliminate neurons affected by triggers embedded in poisoned samples. Our\nmethod partitions the neural network into two stages: feature extraction and feature\nprocessing, aiming to detect and remove backdoored neurons\u2014the highly sensitive\nneurons affected by the embedded triggers\u2014while maintaining model performance\nThis improves model sensitivity to perturbations and enhances pruning precision\nby exploiting the unique clustering properties of poisoned samples. We use the\nH\u00f6lder constant to quantify sensitivity of neurons to input perturbations and prove\nthat using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) can effectively identify highly\nsensitive backdoored neurons. Our extensive experiments demonstrate efficacy of\nH\u00f6lder Pruning across six clean feature extractors (SimCLR, Pretrained ResNet-18,\nViT, ALIGN, CLIP, and BLIP-2) and confirm robustness against nine backdoor\nattacks (BadNets, LC, SIG, LF, WaNet, Input-Aware, SSBA, Trojan, BppAttack)\nusing three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB). We compare H\u00f6lder Pruning to eight SOTA backdoor defenses (FP, ANP, CLP, FMP, ABL, DBD, D-ST)\nand show that H\u00f6lder Pruning outperforms all eight SOTA methods. Moreover,\nH\u00f6lder Pruning achieves a runtime up to 1000x faster than SOTA defenses when\na clean feature extractor is available. Even when clean feature extractors are not\navailable, our method is up to 10x faster.",

H\u00f6lder Pruning divides the model into two distinct components: feature extraction and feature processing. By assuming a clean feature extractor, it concentrates on the feature processing component, identifying compromised neurons by calculating their per-neuron H\u00f6lder constant and pruning those with high values. Evaluation on three image classification datasets highlights the method's effectiveness compared to nine baseline backdoor removal techniques. The authors also demonstrate the framework's capability in scenarios where a clean feature extractor is not guaranteed."

                "value": "This paper presents a backdoor removal framework based on the H\u00f6lder constant, which measures network sensitivity to localized regional changes. Although the approach is intuitive and the evaluation results show promise, there are several places that need  improvement to enhance the overall quality of the paper. My questions are as follows.\n\nThe defender threat model described in section 2.5 appears to be weak and susceptible to vulnerabilities. It relies on the assumption of having access to a \u201cclean feature extractor,\u201d which is exclusively trained on untainted samples for the defender's use. In this setup, the authors assume that the defender trains only the classification head on top of the fixed, clean feature extractor for their specific task, with the data used to train this classification head being poisoned. This assumption raises several concerns. First, what data is assumed to train this \u201cclean feature extractor\u201d? Does it need to be trained on the same dataset as the downstream task? According to the authors in Line 24, the considered clean feature extractors are large-scale, pretrained vision encoders such as CLIP. However, such vision encoders already demonstrate robust zero-shot classification capabilities and achieve high accuracy on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. In these cases, training an auxiliary MLP classifier becomes unnecessary, and mitigating potential backdoor attacks at this stage may lack practical value. Assuming the existence of a clean feature extractor also carries potential risks. Recent studies, such as [1], have demonstrated the feasibility of poisoning large-scale web datasets like LAION[2], which are frequently used for pretraining vision encoders. Moreover, even if trained on clean data, natural backdoors [3] can introduce unintended behaviors that could affect the observations reported in the paper. Thus, guaranteeing the cleanliness of the feature extractor is difficult.\n\nBased on my understanding, the proposed pruning method focuses solely on inspecting neurons within the MLP classifier, under the assumption that the feature extractor is clean. However, the specific configurations used for the baseline methods remain unclear. Most pruning-based backdoor removal methods allow for manual configuration of the layers to inspect. For a fair comparison, all baseline methods should also be limited to operating on the MLP layers only, rather than on the entire network, including the feature extractor. The current text does not clarify the setup chosen for the baselines. If the authors evaluated the baseline methods across the entire network, it could lead to biased results and potentially incorrect conclusions, such as the claim of a 1000x speedup.\n\nI noticed that the ASR (Attack Success Rate) of several well-known attacks reported in Table 1 is significantly lower than what is typically found in the literature. For instance, the ASR for BadNets, SIG, and WaNet are only 82.9%, 43.6%, and 20.4%, respectively, which is much lower than what has been reported in other backdoor removal studies, such as [4,5,6]. Could the authors clarify the underlying reasons for these discrepancies?\n\nThe evaluation results on more advanced backdoor attacks are missing, such as [7, 8, 9]\nThe ablation study for the value of $\\alpha$ used in Ho\u0308lder constant is missing.\n\n===\nReference \n\n[1] Carlini, Nicholas, et al. \"Poisoning web-scale training datasets is practical.\" 2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP).

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q-(1): Many training-time defenses against backdooring attacks have been proposed in the resent. For instance, ABL [1], DBD [2], and CBD [3] propose to train a backdoor-free model with the poisoned dataset without any prior knowledge of the dataset's cleanliness. \nAs the first two works are already considered in this paper, the authors need to rephrase line 128-129. If the definition of \"in-training defense\" is different from these prior work, I would ask the authors to explain the difference for a better understanding.\n\nQ-(3): And at line 148, the final poisoned training dataset is defined as $D' = D \\cup D_{poison}$, which infers that the size of the final training set is larger than the original clean dataset, i.e. $|D'| > |D|$. Most previous backdooring attacks poison a part of the clean samples and yield a poisoned training set the same size as the original training set. Therefore, I would ask, what is the implementation of dataset poisoning? Are all samples used for poisoning actually from $D$?\n\nQ-(4): Does the Robust Accuracy (RA) measure the prediction on all poisoned samples in the training dataset? Or does it measure the accuracy on a test dataset with poisoning but correctly labeled?\n\nQ-(5): In the setting of HP, the clean feature extractor is available, which enables a running time faster than the prior defenses. With the description at lines 241-242, the presence of a clean feature extractor actually indicates that some clean images are available upfront, which first does not match the definition in the defender model at lines 200-201 (i.e. the defender cannot reliably distinguish between clean and poisoned samples). \n\nQ-(8): In Table 1 and Table 2, ANP defense leads to a significant natural performance degradation. In particular with CIFAR10, however, ANP shows the ability to preserve the natural performance in the original paper. Similar results have also been reproduced by the BackdoorBench [4]. Can the authors explain why ANP's performance is relatively low in this paper?\n\nQ-(9): Across Table 1 and Table 2, although the baseline model is the same, the model performance of \"Benign\" training is always different within each dataset. In addition, since Table 2 shows a very high ACC on the GTSRB dataset with \"Benign\" training, does this mean HP in Table 1 actually harms the natural performance a lot?\n\n[1] Li et al., \"Anti-backdoor learning: Training clean models on poisoned data,\" in NeurIPS 2021.\n\n[2] Huang et al., \"Backdoor defense via decoupling the training process,\" in ICLR 2022.\n\n[3] Zhang et al., \"Backdoor Defense via Deconfounded Representation Learning, \" in CVPR 2023.\n\n[4] Wu et al., \"BackdoorBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Backdoor Learning,\" in NeurIPS 2022."

Essential details are deferred to the appendix, making it challenging to grasp the methodology without a thorough examination of supplementary materials.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The selection of hyperparameters, particularly the threshold derived from the analysis of H\u00f6lder constants, may lack robustness across different models, datasets, and adversarial conditions.

The general threat model for pruning methods is: given a backdoored model, defenders need to figure out how to prune the neurons so that the pruned model is clean. However, the threat model of this paper is: given a poisoned dataset, defenders need to figure out how to train the model so that the final model is clean, which is the threat model of in-training defenses. Using this threat model is totally fine, but they also assume the existence of an additional clean feature extractor, which offers more \u201ctools\u201d for the defenders. It deviates from the threat model of general in-training defenses, i.e., altering from how to train a clean model to how to train a clean MLP, which serves as an unfair setup for other in-training defenses.\n\n3.
