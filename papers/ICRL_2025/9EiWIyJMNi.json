    "title": "FLDmamba:  Integrating Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition with Mamba for Enhanced Time Series Prediction",
    "abstract": "Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they lack the capability to capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to the data noise issue in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. By integrating Fourier analysis into Mamba, FLDmamba enhances its ability to capture global-scale properties, such as multi-scale periodicity patterns, in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the Fourier Transform aids in isolating underlying patterns or trends from noise in time series data by emphasizing key frequency components, thereby enabling the model to mitigate noise effects. Additionally, incorporating Laplace analysis into Mamba improves its capacity to capture local correlations between neighboring data points, leading to a more accurate representation of transient dynamics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. This work offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for long-term time series prediction, paving the way for its application in real-world scenarios.

These three challenges are faced by all models, not just those based on Mamba. Furthermore, among the proposed improvements to address these challenges, only the FLDMAMBA module appears to be model-specific; the others seem to be model-agnostic. The paper lacks experiments demonstrating the integration of these strategies into other methods. Additionally, it is unclear whether the authors are making improvements to the Mamba architecture or proposing a collection of strategies to address these three challenges.\n- The authors need to provide details on computational overhead. One motivation for introducing Mamba is its lower time complexity compared to Transformer models. However, on one hand, the authors employ parallel FMamba and Mamba modules, which significantly increase the model's parameters and computational overhead. On the other hand, it is uncertain whether FFT and IFFT will become computational bottlenecks, especially for datasets with a high number of channels, such as \"electricity,\" which has 321 channels.\n- RBF is a model-agnostic data preprocessing method. It is unclear whether its application would also be effective in other methods.\n- In the FMamba module, the authors adopt the Fourier transform on the $\\Delta$ to identify important frequency information and further capture multi-scale periodic patterns in time series data. Can the authors provide a more detailed explanation and analysis, including a visual representation of $\\Delta A$ and $\\Delta_F A$?\n- This paper focuses on Mamba; therefore, the baselines in experimental section should include more Mamba-based methods. Currently, only S-Mamba is considered.\n- There is a lack of discussion regarding related work on the application of Mamba in time series forecasting. The authors should address how their work differs from these existing methods."

Figure 1 suggests that FLDmamba is able to predict accurately when temporal dynamics change. Is it able to handle the problem of distribution shifts in time series? If so, please analyze which specific component(s) in FLDmamba contribute to this capability.\n4. In Figure 3, distinct components of FLDmamba impact model performance \u00a0differently across datasets. Can you provide insights from data perspective into which features in time series may correlate with this impact? Are there limitations or scenarios that the components in FLDmamba may not generalize well to specific time series?\n5. Lines 439-441 indicates the inverse Laplace Transform impact the most significantly on the overall effectiveness. Is this finding consistent across all datasets, particularly noticing that for PeMS08, the variant without ILT is not the least effective one among all the variants of FLDmamba?\n6. Why do the MSE and MAE values in Figure 3 differ from those in Table 1 for the same length setting on the same dataset?\n7. Figure 12 compares the training time between different models. Can you also provide the comparison of inference time as well?"

                "value": "While this paper is generally strong, there are a few minor weaknesses that could be addressed to further strengthen the contribution:\n\n1. Incomplete Justification for RBF Kernel: Although the RBF kernel is presented as an effective data-smoothing technique, its choice is not empirically validated. A comparison with other kernel functions or a focused ablation study would help verify this choice and ensure that RBF is the optimal choice.\n\n2. Unclear Necessity of FFT-IFFT Sequence: The FMamba block employs an FFT followed by an IFFT without a clear explanation of any specific frequency-domain manipulations before reconstructing the signal in the time domain. If this process is meant to filter specific frequencies or reduce noise, the details of such operations should be specified. Otherwise, the sequence could appear redundant, as it may be feasible for the neural network to approximate frequency characteristics without explicitly embedding FFT.\n\n3. Limited Explanation of Explicit Transformations: While the inclusion of Fourier and Laplace transforms is well-motivated theoretically, it remains unclear why these explicit transformations are necessary. Neural networks, particularly those with linear layers, can approximate operations like FFT. A clearer discussion on the unique advantages of explicitly integrating these transforms would strengthen the architectural justification.\n\n4. Incomplete Complexity Analysis: The complexity analysis, which estimates FLDmamba\u2019s time complexity as $\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc41)$, does not fully account for the computational costs of FFT, IFFT, and inverse Laplace transforms. Each of these operations introduces additional costs (e.g., $O(BLNlogL)$ for FFT)) that may not scale efficiently for large datasets. This makes the current complexity analysis potentially optimistic, particularly given that working in the complex domain could introduce additional memory and processing overhead. Wall-clock inference times compared to baseline models would better validate FLDmamba's practical efficiency and help justify the complexity of the FFT and Laplace operations.\n\n5. Incomplete Citation of S-Mamba: While S-Mamba is frequently referenced as a baseline, it lacks a formal citation in the main text. Adding this citation would improve the academic rigor and proper attribution within the paper.\n\n6. Clarity of Figures: Some figures could benefit from clearer axis labels to improve interpretability. For example, in Figure 1, the y-axis label is ambiguous, and the x-axis label as \u201cTime of Day\u201d is potentially misleading since it exceeds 24 hours. Clarifying these points would improve the readability of the time series prediction results."

DCT, for instance, has shown advantages in signal compression and noise reduction and might benefit time series forecasting by emphasizing low-frequency components. Further insight on this choice would help clarify the design decision.\n\n3. Deep learning models with linear layers can often approximate linear transformations, including FFT. Could the authors elaborate on the specific necessity of explicitly embedding Fourier and Laplace transforms rather than relying on the model's intrinsic capacity to learn these linear relationships? This would clarify whether these transformations improve interpretability, robustness, or training efficiency in ways that the network alone might not achieve."
