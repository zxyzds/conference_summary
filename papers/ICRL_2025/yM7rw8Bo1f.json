    "title": "FE-GNN: Feature Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Account Classification in Ethereum",
    "abstract": "Since the birth of the blockchain cryptocurrency trading platform represented by Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain technology have gained widespread attention and accumulated a large amount of transaction data. The analysis of cryptocurrency transactions has become an important research direction with social and economic value, and an important area of blockchain scientific research. Identifying the identity of different cryptocurrency addresses and understanding their behavior is the core challenge to achieve cryptocurrency transaction analysis, otherwise it is difficult to understand blockchain datasets and analyze them with meaningful results. To this end, this paper proposes a blockchain address identity identification method called \\textbf{F}eature \\textbf{E}nhanced \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etworks (FE-GNN). Specifically, a transaction graph is constructed based on the collected transaction data, and graph learning techniques based on graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks are used to infer the blockchain address identity. Experimental results show that the FE-GNN algorithm outperforms previous algorithms.",

The methodology is generally clear, but certain technical terms and detailed GNN layer operations may require additional clarification for broad accessibility. More visual aids might benefit understanding.

The dataset is not ours.\n- Even if the dataset limitation is addressed, the approach is iterative and lacks novelty. Using GNNs and attention mechanisms is standard practice. The authors should probably open a new novelty path to publish the article at a premier conference.\n\nAdditional concerns include:\n\n- While the paper mentions 1,124,130 nodes and 3,752,659 edges, it doesn\u2019t specify the time period over which this data was collected.\n- The evaluation overlooks the temporal aspect of transactions, which is crucial for capturing changes in user behavior over time, especially given how quickly trends can shift in the cryptocurrency space.\n- The paper doesn\u2019t discuss the computational costs associated with the FE-GNN method, but the layered use of convolutions and self-attention mechanisms is likely to demand significant computational resources.\n- There is no ablation study to assess the contribution of each component or step in the FE-GNN algorithm. Without this, it\u2019s unclear which parts of the method are driving improvements, making it hard to pinpoint optimal configurations or areas for improvement."

Insufficient Experimental Comparisons: The author dedicates significant space in Table 4 to comparisons with fundamental or classical methods such as LR, DeepWalk, and GCN. Only two Ethereum analysis methods are included for comparison, but there is a lack of comparisons with other SOTA (state-of-the-art) Ethereum analysis methods, such as REF 1-4.\n3. Logical Gaps in Writing: Many parts lack analysis, leaving the reader confused. For example, in lines 269-272, the author states that there are no existing meta-path related experiments on the Ethereum dataset, and hence proposes a specific process in Fig. 1(a). However, there is no discussion on the differences between the specific process proposed and existing processes for other heterogeneous graphs, why existing methods cannot be directly used, what issues they have, why those issues pose challenges, and what specific solutions the author proposes. The internal mechanism of the proposed method is also unexplained. Similar issues are prevalent throughout the paper.\n4. Unclear Explanations in Key Areas: The dataset constructed is a contribution, but essential details are missing. What is the timeframe of the transactions in the dataset? Are they from recent transactions in 2024 or from earlier years? The author does not analyze or consider potential evolutions and changes in transaction behaviors across different years. Since the dataset is highlighted as a key contribution, it is recommended to make it publicly available.\n5. Numerous Minor Writing Issues: For example, commas are needed after formulas 10, 11, and 12. Similar minor issues are present throughout the text.\n\n\n\nREF1.

The effort in collecting the Ethereum dataset, which includes 1,124,130 nodes and 3,752,659 edges, is commendable. However, necessary clarifications about the dataset are needed. For example, what is the timeframe of the transactions included in the dataset? Does it cover all transactions during that period? Was any preprocessing done? According to the descriptions in the introduction and methods section, the constructed graph dataset is a heterogeneous graph. What are the proportions of each node category in the 1,124,130 nodes?\n3. Could the author further analyze the fairness of the experiments in Table 4? According to the descriptions, the author considers an eight-class problem (as shown in Table 2). However, as per the experimental section, $T^2A2vec$ and HNRL are phishing node detection methods, i.e., binary classification. How were the experimental settings aligned in this context? If $T^2A2vec$ and HNRL are primarily focused on detecting phishing nodes, is it fair to compare their effectiveness in identifying Exchange, ICO Wallets, and the other seven categories?"
