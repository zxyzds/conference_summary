    "title": "Leveraging Side Information with Deep Learning for Linear Inverse Problems: Applications to MR Image Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Reducing the time it takes to acquire a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan is an important problem in healthcare, as it can improve patient care and reduce costs. One way to achieve this is by acquiring only a fraction of the frequency space data and reconstructing diagnostic-quality images from it. This problem can be formulated as a linear inverse problem (LIP), where the forward operator, which maps the structure of the imaged object to the acquired frequency space data, can become rank-deficient or exhibit many small singular values. This leads to ambiguities in the reconstruction process, where multiple images (most of them non-diagnostic) can map to the same set of acquired data. To resolve these ambiguities, it is essential to leverage domain knowledge and, whenever possible, exploit additional context (a.k.a., elevant side information) when solving the LIP. We present a novel, end-to-end trainable deep learning-based method, called Trust-Guided Variational Network (TGVN), that reliably incorporates side information into LIPs to eliminate undesirable solutions from the ambiguous space of the forward operator, while remaining faithful to the acquired data. We demonstrate its effectiveness through applications in multi-coil, multi-contrast MR image reconstruction, where incomplete or low-quality measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct a high-quality image of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. Its generalizability is validated by reconstructing images from different contrasts across different anatomies and field strengths. Compared to a set of baselines that also use side-information, our method reconstructs high-quality images in the presence of heretofore challenging levels of under-sampling, thereby speeding up the acquisition drastically while providing protection against hallucinations. Our approach is also versatile enough to incorporate many different types of side information into any LIP.",

Following the previous weaknes, instead of using Null-space, one way to extract information from side contrast is by learning an representation, you should incorporate this experiments - like for example in E2E experiment, try inputing two channels.\n\n4. Instead of using aliased side information (3x undersampled image from side contrast), it makes sense to use a reconstructed version of other contrast, like using E2E, have you done this experiments?\n\n5. ~20x undersmapling doesn't make sense at all, in practice, or in fastMRI dataset, only a few lines are sampled beside the ARC region, how do you expect recovering any details? especially for pathologies."

Providing some intuitive explanations would improve readability.\n\n**Type of side information**: In this work, different MR image modalities are used as side information. I wonder if the differences between the main information (i.e., measurements) and side information could significantly affect model performance. More specifically, could complementary main and side information (e.g., T1w and T2w) better improve performance? If so, this use of side information appears similar to multi-modality MRI reconstruction. Please clarify the differences between the proposed approach and existing multi-modality MRI reconstruction methods.\n\n**Compared methods**: The proposed method follows a supervised learning paradigm, requiring extensive high-quality MRI images for pre-training. However, state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods are not included, such as supervised Transformer-based methods [1][2][3] and unsupervised diffusion methods [4][5].\n\n**Generalization evaluation on different datasets**: On the two datasets, the training, validation, and test are conducted independently. I wonder if the use of side information can enhance the model's generalization to out-of-domain data.\n\n**Under-sampling mask**: The under-sampling masks used in this work are based on Cartesian sampling. Please evaluate the model performance on other types of sampling, such as radial sampling.\n\n**Experimental results**: \n\n1.\tI observe that the performance of the E2E VarNet in Exp. 3 is significantly decreased compared to its performance in Exp. 1 and 2. However, other baselines and the proposed method do not show this trend. Please explain this result.\n\n2.\tIn the ablation studies, only the SSIM metric is reported.
