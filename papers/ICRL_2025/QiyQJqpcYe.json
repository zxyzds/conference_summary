    "title": "Linguini: A benchmark for language-agnostic linguistic reasoning",
    "abstract": "We propose a new benchmark to measure a language model\u2019s linguistic reasoning skills without relying on pre-existing language-specific knowledge. The test covers 894 questions grouped in 160 problems across 75 (mostly) extremely low-resource languages, extracted from the International Linguistic Olympiad corpus. To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don\u2019t need previous knowledge of the tested language, since all the information required to solve the linguistic puzzle is provided within the context. We find that, while all analyzed models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the best-performing open model at 8.84%.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The key weakness of the paper is that there already exists a benchmark for testing the linguistic reasoning skills of LLMs, specifically LINGOLY ([Bean et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06196)), also comprised of puzzles from the Linguistic Olympiad. It seems that LINGOLY has a wider scope than Linguini, so it is not clear what Linguini adds beyond LINGOLY. The authors also do not discuss the difference between their benchmark and LINGOLY -- in fact, they do not even mention LINGOLY. (I assume that the authors started working on Linguini at a time when LINGOLY had not been released yet, but by the ICLR submission deadline, four months had passed since its release.)"

            "questions": {
                "value": "Minor points:\n- Section 5.1: This analysis could be more in-depth. Was there a pattern in terms of which languages showed a smaller gap across LLMs? It would be particularly interesting to see commonalities between LLMs trained on similar data (e.g., models from the same model family).\n- Section 5.2: You mention the potential impact of the tokenizer. I agree with this hypothesis -- given the fact that tokenizations for low-resource scripts have a higher fragmentation rate ([Ahia et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.614/)), it is likely that the transliteration results in tokenizations that are close to sequences of individual characters. Given the problems that subword-level tokenization (as opposed to character-level tokenization) causes for linguistic and particularly morphological tasks ([Hofmann et al., 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.279/)), this would explain why the LLMs are sometimes better at solving the linguistic problems included in Linguini after the transliteration. I would love to see a more in-depth analysis, especially since you still have some space left.\n\nTypos:\n- 38: \"needs\" -> \"needed\"\n- 107: \"language\" -> \"languages\" \n- 375: \"to to its likelihood\" -> \"to its likelihood\""

Linguini focuses on 75 low-resource languages sourced from the International Linguistic Olympiad corpus and includes three types of tasks: sequence transduction, fill-in-blanks, and number transliteration. Experiments are designed with few-shot prompting, where models are expected to acquire all necessary knowledge about the language within the provided context. Tests conducted on 13 different open and closed LLMs revealed low performance, suggesting that Linguini presents a significant challenge for current language models."

The selection of low-resource languages unlikely to appear in pre-training data and the dataset design that focuses on pure linguistic reasoning abilities are interesting and present a novel idea.\n3. The benchmark was rigorously tested from various perspectives, providing a high-quality resource for the community:\n    - Experiments without context indicate that there is no data leakage.\n    - Using non-Latin scripts helped verify that the models are not relying on Latin-script language cues from the training data for inference, ruling out such reliance.\n    - Examining the relationship between language resourcefulness (proxied by the number of speakers and Google search results) and model performance showed that higher-resource languages tended to yield better performance.\n    - Adding explanatory texts (textbooks) for each language improved performance, indicating that language models can learn linguistic abilities from explanatory content."

Although it is likely that they are low-resource, this assumption alone does not ensure reliability in the experimental results. Since, for some of the models, pre-training data is publicly available, verifying the presence of these languages in the pre-training data would strengthen the paper.\n2. The motivation for putting the constraint that models must learn and utilize the characteristics of previously unseen languages solely through in-context learning is unclear. Language models typically acquire linguistic knowledge through next-token prediction during pre-training, using this knowledge in inference to make few-shot prompting (sometimes with finetuning) effective. However, this study assumes models need to learn language characteristics from context alone for languages not encountered in pre-training. While I understand that the proposed benchmark aims to test only language model capabilities, the broader impact of this study on future LLM research is somewhat unclear due to the huge difference of these assumptions.\n3.

The paper is well written, but it would be good to improve some areas, such as:\n- The related work could use more detail. For instance, it\u2019d be important to add information about very low-resource languages and related attempts at benchmarking.\n- Some specific stats on how Linguini was constructed should be included. The dataset includes 894 examples with some filtering. How many were filtered out from IOL?\n- For a non-linguistic audience, sec 3.2 should include more details and references. Terms used such as: \u201cverb tense conjugation\u201d, \u201ccase declension\u201d, \u201cprinciples of voicing\u201d need some explanations.\n- Section 5 results indicate that for some models, performance degrades as in context examples are increased?

It would be interesting to see how vision-language models perform on these problems using screenshots as the input.\n- While we can indeed call IOL problems require \"linguistic reasoning\" skills, these skills are essentially a form, or a combination of inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning skills. It would be interesting to ground each of the problems to the required skills and perform a more in-depth analysis. The current analysis in this paper seems to be more on a coarse level.\n- As will be raised in my first question, it's not clear how the authors handled diacritical marks in the original IOL problems. This is an important issue that could affect the quality of the benchmark, and this might affect the one-book prompting performance of the models.\n- It is unclear to me whether the benchmark is realistic and how it affects real-world applications.

Specifically, many, if not most, of the IOL problems have diacritical marks on some letters (e.g, \u00f4, \u00f5, and \u00e7)\nTo the best of my knowledge, current pdf-to-text converters do not handle these marks very well---even directly copying the text from a PDF file and pasting it into a text editor can result in missing or incorrect diacritical marks, especially if the problem set is written in LaTeX.\nI noticed that the authors might have briefly mentioned the issue in Section 5.2, but it's not very clear to me.\nCan the authors provide more details on how they handled this issue?\n\nBelow are some more detailed questions/comments:\n2.
