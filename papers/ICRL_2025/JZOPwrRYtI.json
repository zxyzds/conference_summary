    "title": "Interactions Exhibit Clustering Rhythm: A Prevalent Observation for Advancing Temporal Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "Temporal link prediction aims to forecast future link existence in temporal graphs, with numerous real-world applications. Existing methods often rely on designing complex model architectures to parameterize the interaction patterns between nodes. Instead, we re-think the interaction dynamics in temporal graphs (which we call ``interaction rhythms'') by addressing a fundamental research question: \\textit{Is there a strong yet prevalent latent interaction rhythm pattern across different temporal graphs that can be leveraged for temporal link prediction?} \nOur introduced empirical analyses reveal that there indeed exists temporal clustering in node interaction rhythms, where for a specific node, interactions tend to occur in bursts. Such observation leads to two key insights for predicting future links: (i) recent historical links that carry the latest rhythm pattern information; and (ii) the intervals between interactions that further illuminate temporal dynamics. \nBuilding on these empirical findings, we propose TG-Mixer, a novel method that explicitly captures temporal clustering patterns to advance temporal link prediction. \nTG-Mixer samples the most recent historical links to extract surrounding neighborhoods, preserving currently invaluable interaction rhythms while avoiding massive computations. \nAdditionally, it integrates a carefully designed silence decay mechanism that penalizes nodes' long-term inactivity, effectively incorporating temporal clustering information for future link prediction.\nBoth components ensure concise implementations, leading to a lightweight architecture. \nExhaustive experiments on seven benchmarks against nine baselines demonstrate that TG-Mixer achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster convergence, stronger generalization capabilities, and higher efficiency. The experimental results also highlight the importance of explicitly considering temporal clustering for temporal link prediction.",

                "value": "This study highlights a previously overlooked yet strong and prevalent latent interaction rhythm pattern. It introduces a model called TG-Mixer model to capture this pattern, achieving superior performance in temporal link prediction. \n\nFirst, the authors conduct empirical analyses to confirm that such latent interaction rhythm patterns exist in various real-world temporal graphs. They show, at both macro and micro levels, that real-world temporal graph interactions exhibit short-term interaction bursts compared to random interactions. This, in turn, creates a significant clustering pattern in node interaction rhythms. \n\nBased on this finding, the authors propose TG-Mixer, a model to capture these clustering patterns. TG-Mixer samples a node's most recent historical links at each time point and encodes them using node and edge features and time intervals. The model also incorporates a \"silent decay mechanism\" to penalize long-term inactive nodes, thereby capturing temporal clustering patterns with a decaying approach. Through an additional LSTM-based information mixer, TG-Mixer combines temporal and structural information, along with temporal clustering signals, to form node representations, which are then used for link prediction. \nExperimental results demonstrate that TG-Mixer outperforms other baselines regarding faster convergence, stronger generalization capabilities, and higher efficiency."

They conclusively show that real-world temporal graphs exhibit significantly more short-term bursty clustering patterns, making this approach and result convincing and significant.\n\n\u2022\tS2.

Insufficient Detail in Method: The silent decay mechanism is a key component of this study, yet the explanation of the communal rhythm vector in lines 287-301 is insufficient.

Is this rhythm vector updated globally whenever there is an interaction?\n\no\tQ1.1 If the rhythm vector is indeed updated globally with each interaction, how does this work when TG-Mixer processes interactions in batches?\n\no\tQ1.2 Additionally, how is the rhythm vector updated when multiple interactions occur simultaneously in a single time step? This may not matter at high-time resolutions, but I\u2019m curious about the handling of multiple interactions at the same time.\n\n\n\u2022\tQ2. In section 4, the method presents sampling the most recent historical links as a novel approach. However, I\u2019m curious about the differences between this sampling method and the one used in GraphMixer. In lines 265-266, it is mentioned that GraphMixer samples a \"massive number of selected historical neighbors.\" Still, I understand that GraphMixer also samples only the top K links when encoding edge information. Is there a difference here?\n\n\u2022\tQ3. In many results of section 5, temporal link prediction performances in many TGNN models, including TG-Mixer, are evaluated using random negative samples. However, I\u2019m curious whether TG-Mixer would still outperform other baseline models if evaluated using a more advanced negative sampling approach based on node degree distribution (i.e., the frequency of prior interactions).\n\n\u2022\tQ4. In many experiments of section 5, TG-Mixer uses sample size as a hyperparameter, adjusting it differently for each dataset. How did you determine the optimal sample size for each dataset? Did you tune it on the validation set, or did you test multiple sample sizes on the test set and report the best performance?"

Building on the observation that nodes in many temporal networks exhibit bursty interaction patterns, the encoder uses a sample of recently occurring interactions for a given node u and timestamp t, mixing a concatenation of neighbor and link features with a vector-based representation of temporal interaction patterns that are fed into an LSTM model. Addressing a dynamic link prediction task, the proposed architecture is experimentally evaluated against multiple baseline models, showing good performance in seven empirical temporal network data sets. An additional analysis of training times shows that the model can be trained more efficiently than the competing baseline methods. Additional results in the appendix consider standard benchmark graphs from the TGB community benchmark, an ablation study that replaces the information mixer with an attention mechanism, as well as additional experiments on partially shuffled data sets that partially destroy temporal clustering."

            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "Regarding [W1], in the introduction the authors claim that one of the two key contributions of this work is that they \"observe a prevalent and strong pattern of temporal clustering in node interaction rhythms\". However, this is hardly an original contribution of this work, as there are dozens of works outside the ML community that have not only observed but also quantitatively characterized and modeled bursty interaction patterns in temporal networks. A very incomplete selection of works published over the past ten years include:\n\n- M Karsai et al.: Small but slow world: How network topology and burstiness slow down spreading, PRE, 2011\n- R Lambiotte et al.: Burstiness and spreading on temporal networks, EPJ, 2013\n- T Hiraoka: Modeling temporal networks with bursty activity patterns of nodes and links, Phys Rev. Research 2, 2020\n- B Min and KI Goh: Burstiness: Measures, models, and dynamic consequences, Temporal Networks, 2013\n- M Karsai et al.: Empirical findings in human bursty dynamics, Bursy Human Dynamics, 2018\n- Hang-Hyun Jo et al.: Bursty Time Series Analysis for Temporal Networks, Temporal Network Theory, 2023\n\nRelated to this missing related work, it is not ideal that the authors do not use terminology that is common in the field. For instance, they renamed the concept of inter-event times, which is common both in temporal networks and time series analysis, \"silent duration\". This makes the work unnecessarily hard to read. \n\nFinally, it is a well-known fact that bursty interaction patterns are associated with non-Poissonian, heavy-tailed inter-event time distributions, for which the mean is not a meaningful characterization. As such, the analysis of mean silence durations in Figure 2 is not insightful and the resulting comparison to randomly sampled interactions simply repeats the well-known fact that the distributions are not Poissonian (as expected from a memoryless, i.e. Markovian process).\n\nConsidering [W2] from the description in section 4 I could neither understand the definition nor the motivation of the TG-Mixer Encoder component. In particular, how exactly is $C_{rhythm}^t$ defined? How is the information on \"interaction rhythms\" encoded in the \"communal rhythm vector\"? What is the motivation for the definitions of $C_{temp}^t$ and $C_{decay}^t$?\n\nRegarding [W3] I have concerns regarding the problem formulation, especially whether it actually matches the task addressed in the experimental evaluation. In Definition 2, the authors state that they address the task of predicting the presence of a link between a specific pair of nodes and at a *specific* timestamp t. Notably, this is more difficult than predicting whether a link will exist within a given time interval (or batch) or whether a link will exist in the future, i.e. *after* a given timestamp t. In the description of the experimental evaluation, I did not find further details of how this specific link prediction task has been evaluated. My assumption is that the authors have rather addressed a batch-based prediction, i.e. predicting whether a link occurs in a given batch in the test/validation set. Whether or not this task corresponds to the task specified in Definition 2 depends on (i) the batch size, and (ii) the characteristics of the temporal network (i.e. whether it a discrete- or continuous-time temporal graph). Unfortunately no details on batch sizes are mentioned in the description of the experimental results, which would be crucially important for interpretation. Moreover, seeing the very high values of the average precision scores both for the proposed model and the basline methods makes me doubt that the authors actually addressed the task of predicting the presence of a link at a specifc time stamp t.\n\nRelated to weakness [W4], I would like to refer to the challenges in the evaluation of dynamic link prediction that have been outlined in: \n\nPoursafaie et al: Towards better Evaluation for Dynamic Link Prediction, NeurIPS, 2022\n\nThis work introduced EdgeBank and is cited in the paper for this reason. However, it also highlights the need to carefully consider different negative sampling strategies in the evaluation of dynamic link prediction, which have been shown to considerably influence the performance (and ranking) of temporal graph learning models - even for some of the data sets used in the present work. Since the authors cite this work, it is unclear why only the simplest negative sampling method has been used in the experimental evaluation. Also some of the other proposed negative sampling methods are implemented in the temporal graph learning library used by the authors, which would have made it easy to include those as additional results (I also checked but did not find those in the appendix).\n\nMoreover, I appreciated that the authors followed the suggestion of the temporal graph benchmark TGB, adopting a rank-based evaluation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in the supplemental experimental results in the appendix. However, I think that all of the results on the five TGB benchmark data sets for dynamic link property prediction should be shown in the paper - not only those two for which - according to the authors - the proposed method ranks first and third. FInally, I would kindly ask to include the rank-based MRR scores also for the data sets considered in the main paper.\n\nDue to the open issues outlined above, I currently evaluated this work with a score of 3, but would be open to revise this judgment if my concerns are addressed adequately."

While the low silence duration for positive links makes sense, it is not clear to understand whether high silence duration in the random selection is mostly originated from the pairs that would never link or from the inactive period of the potentially interacting pairs.\n\n- Similarly, the discriminative signal argument in 5.3 is overstated by the reason mentioned in the previous bullet point. The following phenomena can explain this as well: (1) if the pairs have never interacted before, then they are also unlikely to interact in the future. (2) if the pairs recently interacted, then they are likely to interact in the current timeframe. Temporal clustering should represent burstiness or not (e.g. periodic interactions), but no interactions are mixed in the analysis."

                "value": "- The idea of the silence decay seems irrelevant to graph data. Have the authors applied this idea into the other bursty time-series prediction? Or if this idea should be related to GNN (i.e. neighbor samples), what is the main reason for that?\n\n- Does the ablation study cover where g(s) = 0 case? That is, the proposed framework works with LSTM and everything but the silence decay, and it would be good to check its performance as well as convergence. This ablation study would be interesting since LSTM is supposed to capture the temporal patterns but the silence decay provides some short-cut to the important information. Hence, it would be great to understand how temporal mix can suffer without this shortcut.\n\n- Silence decay component may clearly discriminates easy negative links more efficiently. It would be great to check the performance on brand-new links (new links that never interacted before) or resurrecting links (interactions after some inactive period)\n\n- This idea would seem to work well for the periodic interactions (e.g. location check-ins). It would be great to show this empirically. Otherwise, the proposed method would be limited only to burst interaction networks."

There are many unclear, confusing, or even inconsistent statements, which make the motivation of this paper weak.\n\n  In this paper, use 'temporal graph networks' (TGNs) to represent deep learning models designed to handle dynamic graphs. However, 'graph' and 'network' are usually synonyms in some literature. 'Temporal graph networks' may cause some ambiguity issues. As I can check, TGN is also the name of an existing method, while the authors used TGNs to represent a set of methods.\n\n  At the very beginning of this paper, the authors claimed that existing methods 'process interactions separately without considering the inherent high-level temporal correlations among interactions between nodes' and thus 'fail to effectively capture the invaluable patterns of interaction dynamics'. Such a statement about the research gap is quite weak. It is unclear for me what do 'high-level temporal correlations among interactions' and 'interaction dynamics' refer to. There are no any toy examples to demonstrate these concepts. From my perspective, directly reaching such a conclusion without giving further interpretations or toy examples (e.g., due to what mechanism existing methods fail to capture such dynamics) is also insufficient, which makes the the motivation of this paper very weak.\n  \n  The authors repeatedly use 'temporal clustering' and 'node interaction rhythms', which are high-level concepts seldom used in related literature. Even though they gave the corresponding definitions in Section 2, they are still hard to understand. For some new but important concepts or terminologies, it is recommended to give some toy examples (e.g., a dynamic graphs with only a few nodes) in addition to their formal definitions, especially at the very beginning of a paper.\n\n  The authors also claimed that Fig. 2 (a) confirms the presence of temporal clustering patterns but why? Since there are no interpretations or examples to demonstrate how to measure the temporal clustering patterns, it is also insufficient to reach such a conclusion, from my perspective. It is also similar for the discussions regarding Fig. 2 (b).\n  \n  For the further discussions regarding the empirical analysis w.r.t. Fig. 2 (a) and (b), the authors claimed that 'recent historical links, carry the latest rhythm pattern information, are crucial for prediction future links'. From my perspective, we can only reach a conclusion that 'recent historical links' are obvious latent futures in dynamic graphs based on Fig. 2 (a) and (b), but cannot say 'they are crucial for prediction future links', since Fig. 2 (a) and (b) are not directly related to the quality of temporal link prediction.\n  \n***\n\n**W2**. Some details of the proposed methods are unclear or with weak motivations.\n\n  From my perspective, the connection between the empirical analysis in Section 3 and some designs in Section 4 is weak. For instance, it is unclear for me why sampling the most recent historical links can preserve interaction rhythm patterns and why conventional sampling strategies may fail to preserve these patterns.\n  \n  There may exist some flaws of only sampling top $m$ most recent historical. It is well-known that some real dynamic graphs may follow typical power-law distributions. The power-law distribution of node degrees may indicate that there are some nodes with many historical links and some other nodes with very few historical links. $m$ is a constant for all the nodes in the proposed method. This design may result in an exception that there are some nodes without any sampled historical links (i.e., with degree less than $m$).\n\n  In Eq. (3), it seems that ${\\bf{C}}_{decay}^{t}$ is a vector associated with a node $u$, but there is no subscript or superscript of $u$ for this vector.\n\n***\n\n**W3**. The theoretical analysis in Appendix A is weak or even needless.\n\n  From my perspective, the connection between Eq. (8) and Eq. (9) is not exactly as the authors claimed in Appendix A. In Eq. (9), the first term ${\\bf{C}}_{rhythm}^t$ is used by all the nodes, as described in Section 4.\n\nWhereas, in Eq. (8), the first term is associated with a node $u$. The connection between the summation in the second term of Eq. (8) and $g(s_u^t) {\\bf{C}}_{temp}^t$ in Eq. (9) is also not clearly interpreted.\n  \n  The discussions in Appendix A cannot be considered as a theoretical contribution, since it just simply listing two existing known definitions (i.e., Definition 1 and Definition 2). There are no original theoretical results and corresponding proofs.\n\n***\n\n**W4**. Some experiments settings and results are unclear, which need further clarification.\n\n  The the definition of the X-axis in Fig. 2 (a) is not given. As a result, it is unclear for me what does 'macro-level distribution' mean and how to correctly read Fig. 2 (a). The unit of the y-axis (i.e, silence duration) in Fig. 2 (a) and (b) is not given."
