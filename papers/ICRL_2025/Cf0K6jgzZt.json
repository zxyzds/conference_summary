    "title": "G2Sphere: Learning High-Frequnecy Spherical Signals From Geometric Data",
    "abstract": "Many modeling tasks from disparate domains can be framed the same way, computing spherical signals from a geometric input, for example, computing the radar response or aerodynamics drag of different objects, or navigating through an environment. This paper introduces G2Sphere, a general method for mapping object geometries to spherical signals. G2Sphere operates entirely in Fourier space, encoding geometric structure into latent Fourier features using equivariant neural networks and then outputting the Fourier coefficients of the output signal. Combining these coefficients with spherical harmonics enables the simultaneous prediction of all values of the continuous spherical signal at any resolution. We perform experiments on various challenging domains including radar response modeling, aerodynamics drag prediction, and policy learning for manipulation and navigation. We find that G2Sphere significantly outperforms baselines in terms of accuracy and inference time. We also demonstrate that equivariance and Fourier features lead to improved sample efficiency and generalization.",

                "value": "The authors introduce a novel neural network architecture to learn spherical signals from 3D geometric data. Their network maps geometric inputs to fourier coefficients in an equivariant graph convolutional network. The learned coefficients are used in a spherical neural network decoder amended with a novel frequency up-sampling technique to produce a continuous spherical signal of arbitrary precision. The proposed approach outperforms baselines on radar prediction, drag prediction and policy learning."

Of the novel architectural contributions only the frequency up-sampling method seems to provide consistent empirical benefit.\n\nThe application domain appears fairly novel. The authors introduce new datasets for radar prediction and drag prediction which extends their contribution. Their results on these datasets exceed the predictive performance of baseline models considerably; however, it is unclear to me if the selected baselines are the most appropriate for these tasks."

It is hard to quantify how good the errors reported in Table 1 are. For instance, [1] uses a similar approach to map geometry to spherical signal. Why not compoare wrt. this baseline which seems better suited.\n- It is hard to understand the method and the experimental performance with the main text alone. I suggest adding a better explanation of the architecture.\n\n**Detailed:**\n- the signals to be learned in FIgure 3 show a high dependence on l and very little variation in m. As such I worry that this example is biased towards a specific architecture. Why not reconstruct other spherical Signals?\n- 230-239: **TSNL** -trainable spherical non-linearities are not a new concept as this has also been used in [2]\n- 215-229: again, applying non-linearities in spatial domain and then going back to frequency domain has been previously done. See e.g. [1,2,3]\n- error is only reported in terms of MSE. As far as I understand the error is not properly integrated over the sphere using the jacobian?\n- 100: FNO/SFNO do not entirely operate in Fourier space.\n- Table 1 reports numerical errors but it is hard to evaluate how good these errors are. In particular given that Figure 5 suggests that the Equiformer and Transformer break down completely.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06721\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03838\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05225"

                "value": "- The paper\u2019s explanation of the model architecture is somewhat ambiguous, particularly regarding the encoder-decoder structure. Specifically, the description of the Equiformer encoder, its output domain, and the role of mean pooling is unclear. For instance, it is not explicitly described how the mesh is encoded into the latent space or how this representation transforms in the decoder to produce Fourier coefficients. From my understanding, G2Sphere applies node-wise spherical representation in Equiformer\u2019s intermediate layer and then combines these node-wise features into a single spherical signal through pooling. However, this flow is difficult to follow based on the paper's explanation alone.\n- The proposed method lacks novelty, as modeling the coefficients of spherical signals directly for continuous function representation has been explored in other domains [1]. Specifically, this paper's approach seems to mainly add equivariant GNNs and equivariant convolutions for modeling spherical coefficients, which limits the originality of its contribution. Additionally, a similar frequency up-sampling technique has been used in another spherical harmonics-based convolution method [2].\n- While the model is designed to be equivariant, the paper would benefit from a straightforward proof or brief explanation of how this equivariance is ensured within the network architecture. Providing this clarification could help readers better grasp the model's theoretical foundation\n- The paper could enhance clarity by including more details on the training process, particularly the training algorithm and loss functions. This would enable readers to understand the optimization approach better and assess the model's robustness.\n- Highlighting G2Sphere's uniqueness and distinct purpose would strengthen the paper\u2019s impact. Similar tasks involving spherical signal modeling exist, such as Implicit Neural Networks on spheres [3,4,5] or spherical convolutions for brain imaging [2]. Differentiating G2Sphere from these related approaches would underscore its novelty and relevance.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10908 \n\n[2] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9759394\n\n[3] https://openreview.net/forum?id=g6UqpVislvH\n\n[4] https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y5SEe3dfniJ\n\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05965"
