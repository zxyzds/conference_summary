    "title": "Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler for multi-modal distributions",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce *Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler* (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a *reference* diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a new approach to sampling from multi-modal distributions called Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS). The proposed method is an extension of previous variational diffusion-based samplers and tries to address their limitations related to their sensitivity to small perturbations of hyperparameters. The authors propose two approaches. The first one GMM-LRDS is based on Gaussian Mixture Models, a more lightweight approach targeting simpler target distributions. The second one EBM-LRDS uses a more computationally expensive Energy-Based Model, allowing one to sample from harder target distributions."

(L35-L36) Why not simply sampling from a single-mode distribution?\n- Weak experiments\n    - Higher dimensional dataset experiments are needed (e.g., MNIST or Cifar10) to show that the proposed methods can be applicable beyond the toy-level experiments.\n    - Quantitative experiments\n        - The measure for computing the distance/divergence with the target distribution is required.\n        - How is Table 2 (mode weight estimation error) connected to the actual task which is approximating the target distribution?\n        - It seems like each column of Table 2 is almost identical.

The paper offers two complementary approaches (GMM-LRDS and EBM-LRDS) that provide flexibility in handling different types of multi-modal distributions.

The authors could have provided a more detailed analysis of the computational costs and optimization strategies as the complexity and scale of the target distribution increases.\n\n2. The method's reliance on prior knowledge of mode locations (target distribution) represents a substantial practical limitation. While the authors acknowledge this requirement, the authors could address how the method might be adapted for scenarios where such information is incomplete.\n\n3. There are concerns about the method's applicability to real-world data distributions, despite its impressive performance on synthetic examples. While the paper demonstrates effectiveness in controlled settings, the approach of learning mode information from reference samples may not translate well to real-world scenarios where modes are less well-defined and data structures are more complex and noisy. The lack of validation on real-world datasets leaves uncertainty about the method's practical utility and generalizability beyond carefully constructed example distributions."

Although these experiments and analyzes may not be appropriate for the contribution of this paper, I wonder whether this sampling strategy can be applied to general real-world applications."

In the experiments, the modes of the target distributions (such as the high-dimensional Gaussian, rings, and checkerboard) are relatively close together. Have the authors tried target distributions with varying number of modes (e.g., 10, 100, 500) with increasing separation, and how does the algorithm perform in these cases?\n\n3. The authors primarily evaluate mode weight recovery error, but there are other important evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Wasserstein distance.
