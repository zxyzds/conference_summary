    "title": "DESIRE: Dynamic Knowledge Consolidation for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning",
    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to equip models with the ability to retain previously learned knowledge like a human. Recent work incorporating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning has revitalized the field by introducing lightweight extension modules. However, existing methods usually overlook the issue of information leakage caused by the fact that the experiment data have been used in pre-trained models. Once these duplicate data are removed in the pre-training phase, their performance can be severely affected. In this paper, we propose a new LoRA-based rehearsal-free method named $\\textbf{DESIRE}$. Our method avoids imposing additional constraints during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, thereby maximizing the learning of new classes. To integrate knowledge from old and new tasks, we propose two efficient post-processing modules. On the one hand, we retain only two sets of LoRA parameters for merging and propose dynamic representation consolidation to calibrate the merged feature representation. On the other hand, we propose decision boundary refinement to address classifier bias when training solely on new class data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and strikes an effective balance between stability and plasticity. Our code will be publicly available.",

                "value": "- The work HiDe-PET[a] has employed different PEFT techniques (e.g., LoRA, adapter) in rehearsal-free CL scenarios. The experimental comparison to HiDe-PET are not include in this paper. As described in the paper[a], HiDe-LoRA achieves SOTA performance on several  CL benchmarks. For example, the performance of HiDe-LoRA on split-CIFAR100 is FAA=76.46% and CAA=84.89%. The performance of  DESIRE on CIFAR100-10T is FAA=72.47% and CAA=81.55%. To better show the SOTA performance of the proposed method, a performance and memory cost analysis about these methods on classical benchmarks is necessary.\n\n[a] HiDe-PET: Continual Learning via Hierarchical Decomposition of Parameter-Efficient Tuning, arxiv2024\n\n- Conduct experiments on the CL benchmarks with a large gap between the pre-trained data and incremental learning data. The work [b] has also pointed out the data overlapping problem between the pre-trained data and CL data, and they proposed four benchmarks (ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark and VTAB) to alleviate this problem. The proposed method can be evaluated on such benchmarks to further show the advantages.\n\n[b] Revisiting Class-Incremental Learning with Pre-Trained Models: Generalizability and Adaptivity are All You Need, arxiv2023\n\n- Concerns about the idea of only maintaining two sets of LoRA parameters. When the data of a new task arrives, the model should adaptively decide whether to learn a new set of PEFT parameters or not (e.g. the work [c] described the prompts parameter). If the difference between the new task and previously learned tasks is large, the newly learned LoRA parameters should be maintained. If the new task is similar as some of previously learned tasks, the newly learned LoRA parameters can be merged with that of such old tasks. If the new task is almost same as previously learned tasks, the new LoRA parameters are not needed. Can the authors make a discussion about this key point? Can maintaining only two sets of LoRA parameters deal with the cross-domain CL case well? In a cross-domain CL case (e.g., VTAB benchmark in [b]), each new task is very different from the previously learned tasks.\n\n[c] LW2G: Learning Whether to Grow for Prompt-based Continual Learning, arxiv2024"

Regarding generalizability, I have a concern: in your method, the backbone is pre-trained on ImageNet 1K and kept fixed during training. I believe the distribution of CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet is quite similar to ImageNet 1K. Therefore, during continual learning, there might not be many new features to learn. However, if you use a more diverse dataset that contains features different from ImageNet, can you still keep the pre-trained backbone fixed? Or is it possible to train the backbone continually with your method?"

However, there are likely complex dependencies between LoRAs for different tasks. How can we ensure that local optima can substitute for the global optimum? Please explain why a greedy algorithm can be used to select LoRAs and provide some comparative experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. Specifically, discuss the computational complexity of the greedy algorithm compared to other potential selection methods such as random selection, using all LoRAs, and selecting LoRAs based on their importance, etc. Additionally, how does the number of sets affect the performance?\n\n3.Are the results in Table 1 reproduced by the authors? There seem to be several inconsistencies compared to the results reported by the original authors. Please provide a brief discussion of their reproduction process, including any differences in implementation or experimental setup that might account for discrepancies.\n\n4.The paper lacks the listing of hyperparameters, which makes it difficult for subsequent readers to reproduce the results. Please provide a detailed ablation study on key hyperparameters, showing how they affect the model's performance.\n\n5.Experiments on ImageNet1k are not listed. Some incremental learning methods perform poorly on ImageNet1k. If time permits, please provide these experiments (it will not reduce the score).\n\n6.The method of retraining the classifier has been used in previous papers.
