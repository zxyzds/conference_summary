    "title": "Underdamped Diffusion Bridges with Applications to Sampling",
    "abstract": "We provide a general framework for learning diffusion bridges that transport prior to target distributions. It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score-matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose *underdamped diffusion bridges*, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and almost no hyperparameter tuning.",

The authors claim that the novelty in this work is extending these to the degenerate noise case. It is not clear to me why the degenerate noise case is useful or important (bullet 1 of contributions).\n\n>Even though for (underdamped) diffusion models with degenerate \u03b7, a corresponding (hybrid) score matching loss has been suggested by Dockhorn et al. (2021), it has so far been unclear whether it can also be connected to an ELBO, i.e., to likelihood optimization.\n\nLikelihood based training for underdamped diffusion models has indeed been investigated in Dockhorn et al. (2021), see e.g. sections\n\"B.3 CLD OBJECTIVE\"; \"F.1.2 MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TRAINING\".  (bullet 2 of contributions).\n\n> Novel underdamped samplers:\nSplitting based samplers  have been used before, as cited by the authors e.g. Monmarch\u00e9 \u00b7 2021. It is claimed by the authros (bullet 3 of contributions) that these samplers are novel. Is the novelty in using these for sampling with diffusions? I appreciate these splitting methods have been used before with damped diffusions and for diffusion models, but the full design space has not been explored.\n\nThe promise of end-to-end training is very attractive (bullet 4 of contributions). How is this achieved in practice? It appears this is only discussed in the numerical experiments yet is one of the main selling points of this work. Can the authors elaborate more on this? It appears from Figure 5 that learning hyper parameters is key to good performance.\n\nThe simulation based loss considered appears to be the same as that proposed in \"Guided proposals for simulating\nmulti-dimensional diffusion bridges\", [1] for forward KL eqn (9) and (11). If I understand correctly, this requires simulating the whole diffusion trajectory under some discretisation to learn the drift and has been considered by [1] for simple drift terms. The approach by [2] requires simulating in the nonlinear diffusion case up to time t and not the whole trajectory (simulation free for affine SDE); and uses a score matching loss (reverse KL) to train a neural diffusion bridge and then to sample diffusion bridges for a range of nonlinear reference diffusions.\n\nThe works [1,2] have not been discussed and appear quite relevant. \n\n[1] Guided proposals for simulating multi-dimensional diffusion bridges SCHAUER et al 2015 \\\n[2] Simulating Diffusion Bridges with Score Matching, Heng et al 2021"

I found unclear why f(x, t) is needed at all in the framework considered in this work, given also that it complicates some derivations. Is it there only to connect with prior works?\n\n2. Does the divergence-based RN derivative formulation of Prop. A. 4. offer any advantage over the result of Proposition 2.3?\n\n3. Equation (24) is not the linear growth-condition, but the globally Lipschitz condition (uniformly in time), that is used to establish uniqueness of the (strong) SDE solution. The growth-condition is missing, and also some condition is required on the diffusion coefficient even when state-independent as here.\n\n4. A large number of conditions are reported at the beginning of pag 15., what condition implies what? Specifically, it is unclear to me how they suffices for:\n- Girsanov: which requires some integrability condition\n- Existance and uniqueness of solution to Fokker-Planck equation (PDE for marginal density evolution), which, from what I understand, is an assumption in [1], and justified later derivations of the same result not relying on that assumption, which at the time was very difficult to establish based on verifiable conditions (it is possible that more recent developments changed the situation, if so the authors can point this out)\n\n5. I did not understand in the proof of Lemma A.3. what yields the equation following \"First, we rewrite the problem by observing that\", in particular the last two terms (the two stochastic integrals, in different time directions)\n\n6. The authors could expand on Remark 3.3.: I quickly glanced at the references but did not spot the relevant parts.\nIs it the case that the drift of the process matching a terminal distribution living on a manifold remains bounded as the process approaches terminal time?\n\n7. What role do the distribution for the augmented space in (16) play?
