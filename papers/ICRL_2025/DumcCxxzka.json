    "abstract": "The function of an RNA molecule depends on its structure and a strong structure-to-function relationship is already achieved on the secondary structure level of RNA. Therefore, the secondary structure based design of RNAs is one of the major challenges in computational biology. A common approach of RNA design is inverse RNA folding. However, existing RNA design approaches cannot invert all folding algorithms because they cannot represent all types of base interactions. In this work, we propose RNAinformer, a novel generative transformer based approach to the inverse RNA folding problem. Leveraging axial-attention, we directly model the secondary structure input represented as an adjacency matrix in a 2D latent space, which allows us to invert all existing secondary structure prediction algorithms. Consequently, RNAinformer is the first model capable of designing RNAs from secondary structures with all base interactions, including non-canonical base pairs and tertiary interactions like pseudoknots and base multiplets. We demonstrate RNAinformer\u2019s state-of-the-art performance across different RNA design benchmarks and showcase its novelty by inverting different RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms.",

This improvement of being able to represent these arbitrary interaction types is achieved by working with the more expressive adjacency matrix representation instead of dot-bracket representations of the secondary structure.\n\nThe RNAinformer model is based on an auto-regressive encoder-decoder transformer. The secondary structure (in the form of an adjacency matrix) is encoded via axial attention (similar to the RNAformer structure prediction model) and finally pooled from a 2d to a 1d vector that is passed to the decoder for decoding into an RNA sequence. RNAinformer also supports constrained generation based on masked sequences, which are embedded into a 2d representation by the encoder if provided, or desired GC content (linearly embedded and added to the embedding).\n\nThe authors also make an interesting, strong claim that training on synthetic data only improves performance over training with experimental data, that -- if true -- would be of significant interest to the community."

A link to the 3D inverse folding literature is currently missing: In the related work section I would have expected to see a mention of the (deep learning based) inverse folding efforts based on 3D structure (e.g. Rosetta, gRNADe, etc.). How does secondary structure-based inverse folding perform compared to 3D based inverse folding, in cases where 3D structure is available? This may represent a route of further testing and strengthening the hypothesis that the essential information for rna structure-function relations are encoded in 2D connectivity patterns (base pairs, psuedo-knots, base multiplets, ...).\n\n2. I am somewhat concerned by the purely synthetic data based training strategy, since synthetic data are created with the same method that is used for evaluation. The authors argue that this allows side-stepping the data gap in gold standard secondary structure data, which is limited in the PDB. However, ultimately any secondary structure prediction method will have been trained on some level of structural data, partially exhibiting the biases and limitations of the datasets that the authors discussed. In addition to those, the models might also have certain model-specific biases that the inverse folding model may then pick up. Since the evaluation is also done by the same prediction model (e.g. RNAfold in 5.1) this risks reinforcing those model-specific biases. While the authors provide an experiment in the appendix to address this, I believe this point deserves further discussion and should be featured more central stage (at the very least including table 20, and possibly a test also for some of the other tasks specifically). This point is quite interesting and -- if true and well supported -- could be of significant interest to the community beyond the method in this paper alone.\nSome analyses I would like to see in this regard: \n- a comparison of training on synthetic data from model 1, but an evaluation with another, independent structure prediction model 2.\n- an analysis of the sequence recovery (an imperfect metric, I know, but still somewhat informative to exclude cases of the inverse folding model overfitting on quirks of the structure prediction model). If you were to go all out, an evolutionary inspired recovery may be even more informative (c.f. https://openreview.net/forum?id=y5L8W0KRUX&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Chengyue%20Gong%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Chengyue_Gong1) in the protein world"

The paper in [1] targets an even more general problem by inverse RNA tertiary structure which solves the RNA inverse problem as a subproblem. Without thorough comparisons it is hard to ensure the merits of the newly proposed approach. \n\n\n1. Tan, C., Zhang, Y., Gao, Z., Hu, B., Li, S., Liu, Z., & Li, S. Z. (2024).

(2022). aRNAque: an evolutionary algorithm for inverse pseudoknotted RNA folding inspired by L\u00e9vy flights. BMC bioinformatics, 23(1), 335.\n\n\nThere is also a similarity between the protein inverse folding problem and RNA inverse folding and since the former has been studied more, most models can still be applicable to the RNAs (instead of 20 enzymes we will have 4 nucleotides). Therefore, works in RNA inverse folding still use these methods as baselines. For example the following works are used as baselines for RNA inverse problems as well.\n\n4.

Z.(2023) PiFold: Toward effective and efficient protein inverse folding. In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\n\nFor many of the comparisons, such as the ones on nested structures in which the proposed method achieves significantly worse results than the baseline methods (SAMFEO), the authors justify the presented results by highlighting the diversity of their generated outcomes. However, the first goal is to derive valid sequences. If neither of the sequences for a task is not valid what would be the benefit of diversity?\n\nThat being said, even for most other prior methods, we can still tune the diversity. For example you can change the temperature value in the Boltzmann sampling part of SAMFEO to get a less skewed distribution that leads to a higher diversity. However, it is important to have a skewed enough distribution to make sure we have a high recall among a small number of candidates.\n\nThe method authors use for measuring the diversity of the valid sequences is computing the mean of pairwise hamming distances between the sequences. This may lead to an overestimation of the diversity because if two RNA sequences have just an indel (unpaired nucleotide) compared to each other, it considers all the subsequence bases as different. I think in this case something similar to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm would be a better measure of dissimilarity.\n\nIt is also not very clear why diversity is an important factor here because unlike image generation and text generation, for RNA design it is more important to get the correct design among the few samples. For example, when looking for a specific RNA to bind to the snoRNA of a new virus to inhibit its activity, why should one care about the diversity of the proposed solutions rather than just having the top few solutions that are more likely to work. It is more important to have the expected RNA among the top few generated solutions to also decrease the costs of downstream in-vivo experiments.\n\nSome results such as the one presented in Figure 4 might portray the amount of non-canonical base-pairs (NC) as a measure that has to be maximized. However, although these non-canonical base-pairs are present in folded RNAs, this amount has to be the correct amount. If these values are maximized by the model but does not lead to valid sequences then why should it be considered as a good thing?\n\nFor experimentally verified 3D structures, which can be considered the gold standard set for evaluation, authors only report the results of their method and do not compare it to any other baseline. From table 17, the ratio of the valid sequences seems to be very low and it would be important to see if prior methods do not outperform RNAinformer on this dataset.\n\nFor the experiments on RNA design with pseudoknots authors only compare their method to antaRNA which is a relatively old method (2015) while many newer methods with superior results have been published since then.\n\nThe length of the supported sequences is mentioned to be capped at 200 in the experiments. That is relatively low to what has been done in recently proposed methods (e.g., 900 in SAMFEO and 500 nucleotides in RDESIGN -- see [1] above). This is an important shortcoming because it is well-known that with the increased length of RNA the problem becomes more difficult. Authors have mentioned this in their Limitations section, but they mention that it is enough for current benchmarks while there are other benchmarks that contain RNAs with more nucleotides and they are simply not used in the presented experiments.\n\nWhile authors propose a new pipeline for designing their synthetic datasets, it would have been better to use the datasets used by prior methods (e.g., Eterna100 or the one curated in [1]) to show the performance of the presented method in comparison to the baseline methods, and then mention the motivation behind using a new pipeline for generating a dataset."
