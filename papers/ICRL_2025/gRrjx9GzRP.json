    "abstract": "Object-centric architectures can learn to extract distinct object representations from visual scenes, enabling downstream applications on the object level. \nSimilarly to autoencoder-based image models, object-centric approaches have been trained on the unsupervised reconstruction loss of images encoded by RGB color spaces. \nIn our work, we challenge the common assumption that RGB images are the optimal target for unsupervised learning in computer vision.\nWe discuss conceptually and empirically that other color spaces, such as HSV, bear essential characteristics for object-centric representation learning, like robustness to lighting conditions. We further show that models improve when requiring them to predict additional color channels.\nSpecifically, we propose the RGB-S space, which extends RGB with HSV's saturation component and leads to markedly better reconstruction and disentanglement for five common evaluation datasets.\nThe use of composite color spaces can be implemented with basically no computational overhead, is agnostic of the models' architecture, and is universally applicable across a wide range of visual computing tasks and training types. \nThe findings of our approach encourage additional investigations in computer vision tasks beyond object-centric learning.",

                "value": "This paper explores the influence of color channels on object-centric representation learning (OCRL). It first shows the strong correlation, sensitivity to lighting, and non-uniformity of the RGB space. Then a combination of RGB with other color channels is studied for OCRL. Experimental results show that RGB with the saturation channel in HSV achieves consistent improvement on all datasets used in this paper. The paper is too technical and lacks novelty as the combination of color space is often used as a trick in computer vision and image processing tasks."

It claims that \"We challenge the common assumption that RGB images are the optimal target for unsupervised learning in computer vision and demonstrate this for OCRL\". It's better to give a reference which shows the RGB image is optimal. \n3. Table 2 is not too strong to support that RGB-S is good enough. Mostly, it's not the best on different datasets, for example, RGB-SV is better than RGB-S on Clevr, MultishapesNet-4, and MultishapesNet-24; HSV is the best for Clevrtex. \n4. The experimental analysis is not convincing, for example in Line 457, which one is most important for representation, the color space or a powerful decoder?\n5. How does the model guarantee universality when it is trained on the combined color space?  I still think RGB is the most universal space even though the performance is slightly worse than others in Table 2."

For example, influence on model parameters and feature characteristics are lacking. I hope the authors can offer further insights into how different target color spaces influence the model.**\n\n**2) Although the authors state that their work focuses on color spaces, the essence of their approach lies in enhancing the model's perceptual abilities by adjusting target objectives. Therefore, using only an RGB-RGB baseline may not be reliable. It would be more robust to include comparisons with methods that use different representations as targets, such as (Seitzer et al., 2023).**\n\n**3) While the authors' idea is interesting, they do not provide a reliable analysis from a representation perspective on the inclusion of different color space targets. For instance, in Figure 2 of the main paper, there is a noticeable similarity between saturation and the mask in highlighting foreground objects; however, the mask is discrete and contains categorical information, while saturation focuses solely on object shape. There is insufficient technical analysis explaining the impact of using saturation.**\n\nM. Seitzer, M. Horn, A. Zadaianchuk, D. Zietlow, T. Xiao, C.-J. Simon-Gabriel, T. He, Z. Zhang, B.

I praise the authors for acknowledging this, but I find that the limited experiments are insufficient to claim that building better color representations for the input would lead to improved performance in realistic image datasets beyond clever, \u2026\n\nI think the idea is good, but the authors should have tested the idea on more challenging datasets.
