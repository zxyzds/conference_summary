    "title": "Directed graph transformers meet metabolic networks",
    "abstract": "Technical advances in sequencing have allowed the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for a wide range of microorganisms. These models have been particularly useful for the prediction of essential genes and reactions, which are potential targets for antimicrobial therapies. However, current methods for essentiality prediction are computationally limited and are not able to accommodate the increasingly available data. Motivated by the success of data-driven approaches in other domains, this work introduces the metabolic transformer, a model designed for holistic identification of essential reactions in  genome-scale models, entirely trained on synthetic knock-out data.  It is demonstrated that the problem of essential reaction prediction can be theoretically formulated as the identification of redundant nodes in directed bipartite graphs. This reveals the limitations of message-passing schemes and motivates the development of a novel graph transformer architecture specifically tailored for metabolic networks. The proposed architecture is capable of addressing the essential reaction identification problem by capturing both the directionality and global structure of metabolic networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we composed a large-scale dataset of genome-scale models reconstructed from real microorganisms.",

It lacks novelty in the methodological approach; the architectural innovations appear incremental, as the \"directed graph transformer\" already exists and is not proposed by authors \n\n3. the experimental results are weak.
