    "title": "NGTTA: Non-parametric Geometry-driven Test Time Adaption for 3D Point Cloud Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Previous Test Time Adaption (TTA) methods usually suffer from training collapse when they are transferred to complex 3D scenes for point cloud segmentation due to the significant domain gap between the source and target data.\n To solve this issue, we propose NGTTA, a stable test time adaption method guided by non-parametric geometry.  In NGTTA, we leverage the distribution of non-parametric geometry on target data as an \u201cintermediate domain\u201d to reduce the domain gap and guide the stable learning of the source model on target data. \n Specifically, we use the source domain model and a non-parametric geometric model to extract the embedding features and geometric features of the point cloud, respectively. Then, a category-balance sampler is designed to filter easy samples and hard samples in the input data to address the class imbalance issue in semantic segmentation. Inspired by previous work, we use easy samples for entropy minimization loss and pseudo-label prediction to fine-tune the source domain model. The difference is that we refine the pseudo labels not only by considering the soft voting among their nearest neighbors in the model embedding feature space but also in the geometric space, which can prevent the accumulation of errors caused by model feature shifts.  Furthermore, we believe that hard samples can effectively represent the distribution differences between the source domain and the target domain. Therefore, we propose to distill the geometric features of hard samples into the source domain model in the early stages of training to quickly converge to an \"intermediate domain\" that is similar to the target domain. By taking advantage of the ability of the non-parametric geometric to represent the underlying manifolds of the target data, our method efficiently reduces the difficulty of the domain adaption. We conduct the main experiments on the more challenge \\textbf{\\textit{sim-to-real}} benchmark about synthetic dataset 3DFRONT and the real-world datasets ScanNet and S3DIS for 3D segmentation task. Results show that our method can efficiently improve the mIOU by over \\textbf{3\\%} on 3DFRONT$\\rightarrow$ ScanNet and \\textbf{7\\%} on 3DFRONT$\\rightarrow$ S3DIS.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The technical contribution of this paper appears relatively weak, as several components are directly adapted from existing 2D TTA methods. For instance, entropy selection and moment update mechanisms are borrowed directly from established 2D TTA techniques [1] without significant innovation in the 3D domain (only add a hard samples selection). Additionally, components such as entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling have been widely explored in related fields, including 3D semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised learning[3]. The authors could strengthen the paper by either justifying the unique adaptations of these methods to 3D point cloud segmentation or by exploring alternative techniques tailored to the specific challenges of the 3D domain.\nFurthermore, it would be valuable to discuss why other geometric features commonly used in 3D point cloud analysis, such as Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), were not considered. Comparing the performance of the non-parametric geometric approach against more established geometric features would provide stronger evidence of its efficacy and clarify the specific benefits of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Wang, Dequan, et al. \u201cTent: Fully test-time adaptation by entropy minimization.\u201d International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). 2021.\n[2] Xie, Qizhe, et al. \u201cSelf-training with noisy student improves imagenet classification.\u201d IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). 2020.\n[3] Hou, Yikang, et al. \u201c3D-SST: Self-Supervised Pretraining for 3D Scene Understanding.\u201d European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV). 2022."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The statement \"We can see that as the sample count decreases, the threshold will gradually increase\" is reasonable. However, it\u2019s stated that tail categories with fewer samples will have a larger entropy threshold and \"We can see that as the sample count decreases, the threshold will gradually increase\", but the reasoning behind this isn't obvious from the equation itself. \n\n2. Whether Eq.~(4) is applied individually to each point cloud or collectively across all point clouds. Does each point cloud have its own unique $\\sigma_c$, or do all point clouds share the same $\\sigma_c$?\n\n3. For Eq.~(13), the notation could be confusing for readers. Since $\\mathbf{f}_i$ represents a vector, and $\\mathbf{f}_{ij}$ also appears to be a vector, the mathematical symbols could be refined to avoid potential misinterpretation.\n\n4. Lastly, it would be insightful to discuss the model\u2019s performance when transitioning from indoor datasets to outdoor datasets. Are there any notable differences in performance, or specific challenges encountered when adapting to outdoor data?\n\n5. Although the method\u2019s applicability to multiple architectures is partially demonstrated, more rigorous evaluation on additional 3D segmentation backbones (e.g., MinkowskiNet, RandLA-Net) would help generalize the findings. Providing results for diverse architectures could highlight the robustness of the NGTTA framework, particularly if model performance varies significantly with architecture.\n\n6. Visualization of Intermediate Domain Effects: While the paper presents the concept of an \u201cintermediate domain,\u201d it would benefit from visualizations that illustrate this intermediate representation\u2019s impact on the distribution alignment between source and target domains. For example, t-SNE or UMAP plots showing the evolution of feature space alignment as the model adapts would provide more concrete evidence of the intermediate domain\u2019s role in reducing domain gaps.\n\n7. Comparing the performance of the non-parametric geometric approach against more established geometric features such as FPFH would provide stronger evidence of its efficacy and clarify the specific benefits of the proposed method."
