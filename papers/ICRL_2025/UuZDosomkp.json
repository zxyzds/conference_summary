    "title": "ConML: A Universal Meta-Learning Framework with Task-Level Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning enables learning systems to adapt quickly to new tasks, similar to humans. To emulate this human-like rapid learning and enhance alignment and discrimination abilities, we propose ConML, a universal meta-learning framework that can be applied to various meta-learning algorithms without relying on specific model architectures nor target models. The core of ConML is task-level contrastive learning, which extends contrastive learning from the representation space in unsupervised learning to the model space in meta-learning. By leveraging task identity as an additional supervision signal during meta-training, we contrast the outputs of the meta-learner in the model space, minimizing inner-task distance (between models trained on different subsets of the same task) and maximizing inter-task distance (between models from different tasks). We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with optimization-based, metric-based, and amortization-based meta-learning algorithms, as well as in-context learning, resulting in performance improvements across diverse few-shot learning tasks.",

The paper briefly states that this introduction helps to \"enhance both alignment and discrimination abilities.\" If it could clarify which specific pain points in current meta-learning this contrastive learning approach addresses and which persistent challenges in meta-learning it successfully overcomes, the value of this work would be significantly greater. \n\n2. The performance of ConML depends on several hyperparameters (e.g., the weight parameter $\\lambda$, sampling strategies, and distance functions). Manual tuning of these settings for different tasks could make the framework less user-friendly and time-intensive to optimize for best results.\n\n3. ConML has been tested primarily on small to medium-scale models. Its effectiveness on larger architectures, like deep convolutional networks or transformers, remains unproven, potentially limiting its scalability in more computationally demanding applications.\n\n4. ConML has been validated mostly on few-shot learning tasks like classification and regression, with limited testing on more complex tasks such as object detection, segmentation, or NLP tasks. This focus restricts the scope of its demonstrated effectiveness across broader real-world applications."

For instance, in MAML, it uses the influence of the task-specific model on the meta-parameters, while in ProtoNet, it utilizes sample-level information as task-level information, which feels overly customized. Additionally, I think the use of cosine or Euclidean distance to measure model similarity to be inadequate."

How is this complexity addressed\n2. Bilevel meta-learning is also an important approach that the authors do not mention\n3. In my opinion, MAML and ProtoNet aim to establish a common initialization or feature space across tasks. However, in this paper, the use of d_out disrupts this objective, potentially leading to instability during training\n4. In a few-shot learning setting, the task-specific learning model cannot be fully optimized. Therefore, directly using e* as a reference does not seem advisable."

Moreover, it cannot be applied universally to solve any task, but it is evaluated only on in-domain scenarios considering tasks sampled from the same dataset during meta-training and meta-testing.\n*  Does the projection function $\\psi:H\u2192\\mathbb{R}^d$ need to satisfy certain properties? A more in depth explanation, also with some mathematical proof, and references, might be useful for the reader.\n*  Given that the projection function $\\psi$ is method-dependent, would it be possible to define a universal function (or neural network) that could be applied across all meta-learning frameworks? This would align better with the learner-agnostic claim.\n*  In line 107, the authors provide a definition of meta-learning assuming that the meta-learned model generalizes to a new task $\\tau'$ sampled from $p(\\tau')$, which is different from the task distribution $p(\\tau)$ used during meta-training. This is not common in \"standard\" meta-learning, as one of the assumption is that all tasks (both for meta-train and meta-test) are sampled from the same probability distribution. Do the authors refer here to the cross-domain scenario, instead? Is the proposed approach applicable also in this challenging scenario?\n* Is there evidence or experimental support for the claim that $d_{out}$ enhances generalization? All experiments appear to be performed considering the in-domain scenario, which does not fully demonstrate generalization capabilities.\n*  Do the tests performed with CAML w/ConML consider the cross-domain scenario? Specifically, was meta-training performed on the same dataset combinations as in CAML (ImageNet-1k, Fungi, MSCOCO, and WikiArt) and then evaluated on the datasets in Table 3? If not, the results in Table 3 may not be directly comparable.\n*  Regarding the experiments in Figure 2.c, could you clarify why MAML\u2019s performance remains unchanged as the number of shots increases? Additionally, why does MAML with ConML and MAML with $d^{in}$\u200b perform better with fewer shots than with more? I expected the performance to improve with more shots at test time. Also, I recommend conducting experiments with the same number of shots during meta-training and meta-testing."

Optimization-based models implicitly contain feature information [2], and metric-based prototypes directly encode feature information. In this sense, contrasting models may be inherently similar to contrasting features. The authors should provide more context on how model contrastiveness differs from or extends feature contrastiveness. Clarifying this relationship is important, even if model contrastiveness is a generalization.\n2. The paper lacks comparisons with other contrastive-based meta-learning algorithms such as ANIL [1] and MAML with the Zeroing trick [2]. Including these baselines would help position the contribution more clearly.\n3. It would be informative to see how the model alignment dynamics evolve during training. Plotting alignment metrics (e.g., d^in, d^in - d^out, d^out) for MAML and ConML could provide insights into the alignment/discrimination process.\n4. An ablation study exploring different meta-contrastive objectives (e.g., only d^in or only -d^out) could help gain more insight into the relative importance of alignment vs. discrimination for meta-learning."
