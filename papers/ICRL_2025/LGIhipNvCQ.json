    "title": "TUI: A Conformal Uncertainty Indicator for Continual Test-Time Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) addresses the challenge of adapting models to sequentially changing domains during the testing phase. Since no ground truth labels are provided, existing CTTA methods rely on pseudo-labels for self-adaptation. However, CTTA is prone to error accumulation, where incorrect pseudo-labels can negatively impact subsequent model updates. Critically, during testing, a CTTA method can not detect its mistakes, which may then propagate through further adaptations. In this paper, we propose a simple uncertainty indicator called TUI for the CTTA task based on Conformal Prediction (CP), which generates a set of possible labels for each test sample, ensuring that the true label is included within this set with a given coverage probability. Specifically, since domain shifts can undermine the coverage of predictions, making uncertainty estimation less dependable, we propose compensating for coverage by dynamically measuring the domain difference between the target and source domains in continuously changing environments. Moreover, after estimating uncertainty, we separate reliable test pseudo-labels and use them to discriminatively enhance the adaptation process. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively estimates the uncertainty for CTTA under a specified coverage probability and improves adaptation performance across various existing CTTA methods.",

                "value": "This paper aims to mitigate error accumulation during test-time adaptation (TTA) by reducing the impact of model adaptation when the model prediction is deemed too uncertain. To achieve this, the authors propose storing a portion of the labeled source dataset as a calibration set and introducing TUI, an uncertainty indicator method based on conformal prediction. TUI weights the influence on the training process for each test sample based on this uncertainty."

                "value": "[W1] Concerns arise regarding the practice of storing and utilizing source data. TTA research operates under realistic assumptions, with related studies avoiding access to training data during testing. In scenarios where training data cannot be accessed due to data privacy issues, how can this limitation be addressed? The paper \"Leveraging Proxy of Training Data for Test-Time Adaptation, ICML 2023\" suggests utilizing condensed data to leverage training set information while maintaining data privacy in TTA contexts. Could TUI also be applied when employing a proxy for training data, similar to the aforementioned approach?\n\n[W2] Regarding complexity, the use of both a pretrained source model and the testing model may significantly increase time complexity. Additionally, the requirement to forward both the test and calibration data for each sample adds to this complexity. How much time does complexity increase as a result?\n\n[W3] The corruption benchmark focuses on synthetic domain shifts, which may not reflect realistic scenarios. Validation of the method\u2019s effectiveness on natural domain shift benchmarks is necessary. Does it perform well on natural domain shift benchmarks like VisDA-C and Cityscape-to-ACDC, which have been utilized in prior CTTA research?\n\n[W4] Furthermore, there appears to be insufficient comparison with recent literature. Could the authors provide a comparison with the following works?\n\n- (SAR) Towards stable test-time adaptation in dynamic wild world, ICLR 2023\n\n- (DePT) Visual prompt tuning for test-time domain adaptation\n\n- (VDP) Decorate the newcomers: Visual domain prompt for continual test-time adaptation, AAAI 2023\n\n- (EcoTTA) Ecotta: Memory-efficient continual test-time adaptation via self-distilled regularization, CVPR 2023\n\n- (SVDP) Exploring sparse visual prompt for cross-domain semantic segmentation, AAAI 2024\n\n- Reshaping the online data buffering and organizing mechanism for continual test-time adaptation, ECCV 2024\n\n- A versatile framework for continual test-time domain adaptation: Balancing discriminability and generalizability, CVPR 2024\n\n- (Continual-MAE) Continual-MAE: Adaptive distribution masked autoencoders for continual test-time adaptation, CVPR 2024\n\n- (ViDA) Vida: Homeostatic visual domain adapter for continual test-time adaptation, ICLR 2024\n\n- (BECoTTA) BECoTTA: Input-dependent Online Blending of Experts for Continual Test-time Adaptation, ICML 2024\n\n[W5] Using labeled source data may be perceived as somewhat akin to cheating.

Comparative experiments on computational and memory overhead with and without CPAda would strengthen the evaluation.\n\n3. **Lack of Ablation Study**: The paper does not include an ablation study to isolate the effects of individual TUI components, such as dynamic thresholding, making it difficult to understand the specific impact of each on performance.\n\n4. **Dependency on Additional Calibration Set**: TUI requires an extra calibration set, which may be impractical in real-world applications due to storage limits or privacy constraints.

Recent advancements in CTTA such as [1-3] in recent publications are not considered. This omission may raise concerns about whether TUI can maintain its performance advantages when compared to the latest methods.\n2. (**minor**) TUI's requirement for labeled source data for its calibration set may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable or impractical to use such as CLIP. (**major**) This limitation also complicates direct comparisons with other CTTA methods that do not use source domain knowledge, potentially skewing the fairness of these comparisons .\n3. (**major**)The paper claims that the TUI-guided adaptation method (CPAda) improves accuracy and reduces uncertainty. However, the evidence provided across three datasets and various settings (different alpha values) does not consistently support these claims. Notably, clear improvement is observed only when CPAda is applied to Tent on CIFAR100. In contrast, other applications show minimal or no benefits\u2014for instance, when CPAda is applied to CoTTA and C-CoTTA on CIFAR100, as well as CoTTA, SATA, and C-CoTTA on CIFAR10, not only do the accuracy improvements lack significance, but all three uncertainty metrics (NLL, BS, ECE) actually increase. \n4. (**minor**) The paper does not provide an analysis of the computational efficiency of the TUI-guided method (CPAda), which is crucial given the computational demands of TTA methods. For each incoming batch, TUI requires that the forward process be conducted on the new batch and calibration dataset with both the original source model and adapted model. This quadruples the computational load compared to simpler methods like CoTTA, which does not require multiple forward passes per batch. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practicality of deploying TUI in environments where resources are constrained or efficiency is a critical factor. \n\n[1] ViDA: Homeostatic Visual Domain Adapter for Continual Test Time Adaptation, ICLR 2024\n\n[2] Becotta: Input-dependent online blending of experts for continual test-time adaptation, ICML 2024\n\n[3] Decorate the Newcomers:Visual Domain Prompt for Continual Test Time Adaptation, AAAI 2023"
