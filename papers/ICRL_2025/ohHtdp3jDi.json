    "abstract": "Bayesian deep learning (BDL) is believed to be an effective approach to enabling uncertainty estimation and improving the generalisation and robustness of classical deep learning with the help of the Bayesian principle. Considering its non-meaningful weight-space prior and problematic Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, functional inference with Wasserstein distance has recently emerged as a promising direction in this field. However, existing efforts require different types of degenerations to achieve tractable Wasserstein distance computation, which limits the predictive and uncertainty estimation capabilities. In this paper, we propose two novel implicit functional BDL (ifBDL) approaches, i.e., implicit functional Bayesian neural networks and implicit functional Bayesian deep ensemble. The common idea is to implicitly transform the BDL posterior to a Gaussian process via the neural tangent kernel to facilitate tractable 2-Wasserstein distance computation and preserve the neural network parameterization. The experimental evaluations on standard tasks show that ifBDL has superior predictive and uncertainty estimation capabilities compared to existing weight-space and function-space approaches.",

                "value": "This paper considers the common problems of Bayesian Deep Learning when using the KL divergence. To address these issues, they propose to switch from weight-space prior (and KL) into functional inference (with Wasserstein distance), which is recently a common research direction. To increase the predictive and uncertainty estimation capabilities while using Wasserstein distance, they propose two novel implicit functional approaches. The main idea is to implicitly transform the posterior of the Bayesian Deep Learning method to a GP via NTK and get tractable 2-Wasserstein distance computation. In particular, the authors consider two Bayesian Deep Learning methods \u2014 Bayesian Deep Ensemble and BNNs.

                "value": "Despite its strengths, the paper has a few major and minor weaknesses.\n\n**Major weaknesses:**\n\n1.  Lack of comparison with the latest methods in the functional-space research direction - e.g., [1], [2], [3], and [4].\n2. More visual examples (e.g., 2d classification) would be needed to better understand how good are these methods in uncertainty quantification? Maybe worth to consider the examples from [5].\n3. Missing comparison against different sizes of BNNs - I would like to understand what are the current computational limits of these approaches.\n4. I think that this paper is missing some justifications and introducing notations, e.g., in 3.2, I don't know where $L$ came from and assume it's from [6]. Overall, the 3.1 and 3.2 should be rewritten in a more approachable way.\n5. Another issue - I'm not sure about the presented results, when I checked (e.g., UCI regression) in GWI paper, the results for most of the methods were much different from the one presented in this paper. Could you explain why?\n6. Finally, the GWI paper uses tanh activation function and you are using rbf, why? Is it a source of the different results?\n\n\n\n**Minor weaknesses:**\n\n1. In Theorem 1, the notation for $f_{in}$, $m_{in}$ and $\\Sigma_{in}$ might be hard to follow at the first glance. So, I will suggest to slightly change it.\n2. In line 309, should be \"Wasserstein\"\n3. In Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, we should have \"training,\" not \"inference,\" right?\n  \n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Rudner, T.

Although using the Wasserstein measure has been done before in the context of functional BNNs, it has not been done in the same methodological framework as here, where in order to evaluate the Wasserstein measure between $q$ and $p_0$, the authors leverage the neural-tangent kernel (NTK) theory to transform the BNN posterior to a Gaussian Process at every training step (after computing the likelihood), allowing computation of the Wasserstein measure - they call this implicit functional BNN (ifBNN). This allows BDL parametrization of the network, whilst allowing computing the Wasserstein measure. In addition, the authors propose implicit functional Bayesian Deep Ensemble (ifBDE). The core idea in ifBDE is to train multiple neural networks, but constraining the aggregated function of the ensemble via regularisation by usage of the Wasserstein measure between the aggregate ensemble function $q(f;w)$ and  $p_0(f)$. The authors then showcase and benchmark their method in regression, classification and a contextual bandit setting."

There are currently no in-distribution uncertainty quantification evaluation on the classification datasets, which in my opinion are highly important in these settings.\n     2. I am a bit concerned/confused by the BDE results on all of the presented problems. If I understand correctly: BDE is the ensembling of KLBBB models, and with that in mind, it is not clear to me how it is possible that BDEs can be performing worse than individual KLBBB models?\n     3. Although the authors compare to several methods, I think there is a large class of highly popular BNN methods missing such as Last Layer Laplace methods and simply regular deep ensembles. This is especially important due to the fact that weight space variationally inference BNNs are known to be quite brittle. Unfortunately I do not think that the paper currently shows the full picture of comparable methods.\n* Could the authors comment a bit on the motivation behind implicit functional BDE? Moreover, could the authors comment on whether or not they have observed if the functions that stem from the members in the ifBDE models are functionally diverse? It is not clear to me that the specification the authors have of these models would not simply cause the models to collapse to the same functions since they are jointly trained.\n* Do the authors have some references for their specification of BDEs? I have not seen this particular specification of them before, and there does not appear to be any reference on this specification.\n* Could the authors comment on scalability issues of these methods? Do they suffer from the same scalability issues as other NTK methods?\n* Although there are some details presented on network and method hyperparameters, the majority of details are missing such as prior specification and tuning in the compared methods, optimizer details, network activation functions are missing, just to list a few. Good choices of these are key for these methods to work, and without at least a few listed, it is hard to say if these are confounders in the results.\n\nMinor comment:\n* In line 359 it is not clear to me what \"... can achieve accuracy of $10^{-10}$ ...\" means."

This makes the computational cost prohibitively high, posing a challenge for applying this method to large datasets typical in the deep learning era.\n- To my understanding, obtaining the Gaussian Process results in [1] and [2] requires a specific NTK initialization at the neural network's starting point to ensure convergence. This raises questions about how a functional posterior distribution can be applied using a general neural network, as convergence might not be guaranteed without this special initialization.\n- The primary and critical point that prevents me from leaning towards acceptance is that the experiments were conducted only on a simple 2-layer MLP. Many methods exhibit significantly different behavior as model and data scales increase, and experiments on such a limited model scale do not provide sufficient evidence that the proposed prior distribution would be effective for training large-scale models.\n- There is a lack of ablation studies such as the number of measurement points used and how performance changes as the number of these points increases. Including such ablation experiments would provide valuable insights.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Lee, J., Xiao, L., Schoenholz, S., Bahri, Y., Novak, R., Sohl-Dickstein, J., & Pennington, J. (2019).

                "value": "* While the authors write the paper clearly, inaccuracies in their exposition hurt the overall presentation. For example, the authors confused \"BNN\" with \"variational BNN\". This is not a bad practice since it means the authors ignore other kinds of BNNs in the paper. For instance, the linearized Laplace approximation, which has a similar connection to the (empirical) NTK [1, 2, 3, etc.], is ignored. Moreover, the linearized Laplace has been extended to the function space [4], which achieves far better performance than the proposed approach.\n\n* The proposed method seems very expensive since linearization must be done at every ELBO optimization iteration. This is in contrast to the functional Laplace [4], which only requires the Jacobian computation at test time. Indeed, during training, all one needs is MAP estimation. Similarly, in the VI literature, the author ignored [5], which I believe to be the state-of-the-art for function-space VI. \n\n* Given the cost, the performance of the proposed method is sub-par. Even the deep ensemble version generalizes badly (95% acc on MNIST, 85% on FMNIST, and 48.26% on CIFAR-10). Moreover, the bandit experiment is very minimal with only a single dataset. Please see [6] for a better benchmark suite. Finally, the authors mentioned in their conclusion that their future work will be to scale the method to GPT-4 and Gemini. I strongly suggest the authors address the underperformance issues on small-scale datasets first.\n\n* Better experimental settings should be used. I don't think MNIST, FMNIST, and other small scale datasets (unless they're for sequential decision-making) along with small-scale MLP models are useful anymore for truly evaluating the methods. In the age of large-scale models, the Bayesian deep learning community must adapt to the change. This means, studying the applications in LLMs, diffusion models, and other foundation models. This will force us, the community, to come up with BDL methods that are both theoretically sound _and_ computationally efficient. Example settings that the authors can use: [7, 8]\n\n* The justification for the approximation of $q(f \\mid D)$ from $q(w \\mid D)$ via the NTK theory is shaky. It has been shown by [6] that even large models (which the authors didn't use) are not in the NTK territory yet --- using the NTK as a proxy is thus very shaky. \n\n\n**References**\n\n1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01930\n2. https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08400\n3. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03968\n4. https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13711\n5. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17162\n6. https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00137\n7. https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13111\n8. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05015"
