    "abstract": "Despite their wide application across various fields, current molecular property prediction models struggle with the challenge of activity cliff, which refers to the situation where molecules with similar chemical structures display remarkable different properties. This phenomenon hinders existing models' ability to learn distinctive representations for molecules with similar chemical structures, and results in inaccurate predictions on molecules with activity cliff. To address this limitation, we first present empirical evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of standard training pipelines on molecules with activity cliff. We propose a novel approach that reformulates molecular property prediction as a node classification problem, introducing two innovative tasks at both the node and edge levels to improve learning outcomes for these challenging molecules with activity cliff. Our method is versatile, allowing seamless integration with a variety of base models, whether pre-trained or randomly initialized. Extensive evaluation across different molecular property prediction datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

                "value": "- Activity cliff is a critical concept in chemistry, primarily based on differences in molecular structure. Any method addressing this task should be motivated by chemical intuition related to these structural variations somehow. However, the proposed method lacks insights that would specifically address activity cliffs. It is more like tackling a hard sample problem rather than focusing explicitly on the activity cliff challenge.\n\n- How is the \"training loss for the top 10%-loss molecules with and without AC\" calculated? Are the molecules involved in the matched pairs removed from this calculation? If the training involves only AC vs. non-AC molecules, the results seem fairly intuitive. Additional clarifications would help make these experiments easier to understand.\n\n- In Fig. 4, are the dashed and solid edges used to denote different labels or categories, like being used differntly? Or are they simply shown to illustrate how AC pairs vary?\n\n- The selection of molecules is based on loss differences, but this approach does not necessarily correlate with AC performance. For instance, an AC might result in high loss, but a high loss does not necessarily indicate an activity cliff.\n\n- Each task seems to require a separate graph, as molecules can behave differently depending on the properties being evaluated. This approach might incur significant computational costs. Table 9 shows the results of AC pairs obtained in each dataset, which helps clarify the data size. However, the number of pairs seems quite large, making the computational complexity and scalability other concerns.\n\n- The backbone models seem not very new. There are many recent SOTA models and the authors should evaluate the performance of adding the proposed component to these models. \n\n- For some datasets, the method shows only marginal improvement. Have the authors explored the underlying reasons for this?\n\n- The experiments seem only run once, which might not robust. The authors could try cross validation or run several times to report the standard deviation. \n\n- There are already proposed AC datasets [1, 2], why the authors do not evaluate the proposed method on them? \n\n[1] Van Tilborg, Derek, Alisa Alenicheva, and Francesca Grisoni. \"Exposing the limitations of molecular machine learning with activity cliffs.\" Journal of chemical information and modeling 62, no. 23 (2022): 5938-5951.\n[2] Zhang, Ziqiao, Bangyi Zhao, Ailin Xie, Yatao Bian, and Shuigeng Zhou. \"Activity cliff prediction: Dataset and benchmark.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.07541 (2023)."

I could not see results indicating why molecular property prediction models struggle in these casese. Instead, the work include some empirical evidence that only reinforces the (known) observation that generalizing to AC is challenging.\n     - Additionally, many works investigated activity cliff in the context of property prediction. See for example \"Zhang et al., Activity Cliff Prediction: Dataset and Benchmark, 2023\", or \"Wu et al., A Semi-Supervised Molecular Learning Framework for Activity Cliff Estimation, 2024\". These works are not cited or compared.\n    - Line 75: \"We propose to re-formulate molecular property prediction as a node classification problem.\".

In general, previous works on this direction are not accounted for. \n- Novelty. The novelty of the work appears limited. As stated in line 324, the methodological novelty is the extension from node to node+edge curriculum learning. However, the definition of the edge-level loss (Eq. 2) is based on the same node-level loss. This work largely appears as an application of standard curriculum learning.\n- Lack of baselines. The authors only compare the proposed method to the baseline network, i.e., no other methods of any kind are taken into account. The authors should compare the proposed method to existing methods. These include works focused on AC prediction (see points above for some examples), but also methods broadly focused on representation robustness (e.g., based on adversarial perturbations or mixup) and domain generalization."

I found both the analysis of model performance on the molecules with activity cliffs a strong addition to the literature, to take something commonly acknowledged and quantify it is vital work, and the novel exploration of the problem very good to see. \n\nSummary:\n* The authors present a novel approach to tackling the problem of molecules exhibiting an activity cliff. This problem plagues computational chemists as many molecules share large portions of their structure, differing only for a small percentage of the molecule, and still have very different properties. Such properties are intuitive to human experts, but hard to handle using many deep learning methods. \n* The authors take this anecdotal knowledge and make strong baseline measurements of the discrepancy found in many SOTA models in cases where activity cliffs are present. \n* The authors then reformulate the problem of molecular property prediction into a node classification problem as part of a graph structure representing molecules with similar structures.\n* They present this worm as Learning with Activity Cliff (LAC) - and use the concept of curriculum learning to slowly introduce harder to separate AC molecules - this work shows improvements across a range of benchmark datasets and conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate which properties are contributing."

From the tables alone it\u2019s hard to evaluate if the degree of improvement is significant or not. If a couple of reference models could be added to these tables to show other work that would help calibrate my perception of the improvement of the LAC method. \n* The comment about the lack of baseline against which to judge the contributions applies to tables 4 and 5 and 6 as well. (However I recognise that adding / evaluating baseline models for all cases can be expensive / difficult to conduct.) \n* The way the initial node features are generated feels unclear to me - on line 228 \u201cIn this graph, each molecule corresponds to a node, and the molecule\u2019s chemical structure can be stored as node features\u201d - How exactly are these features chosen? Are these features the readout from the baseline models (GraphGPS, UniMol ?) or are these simply generated from something like RDKit. My interpretation from the text is the former, but some more clarity here in the text would be good. \n* I find it slightly unclear what the exact message is - my take away is the LAC is a really good way to improve the abilities of an already performed model - but I'm left concluding the paper a bit unsure exactly how strong the case is.\n* The loss distributions in Fig 6 are very hard to read, please use the same binning scheme for both histograms and show them either with low alpha or as lines only so I can see how they change. Also the text is too small, try adjusting figure sizes for these results?"

In line 3 of the algorithm (line 312) the mini batch is chosen, then pairs with the activity cliff found. This means the second term in the loss L_e is dependant on how many samples are found, did you study the impact of the batch size on the training? As a reader I would want to know - my dataset has X% of possible activity cliff molecules, what batch size Y do I need to see an improvement of magnitude Z using this method? Otherwise I would suspect the impact to only be a small reguarlising term? Is this a correct analysis - and could some more detail be given on this point? \n* Do you have any analysis at how effectively the LAC process picks out the molecules which have an activity cliff? It selects the ones with high loss and then forms edges based on the relative labels - but do you know how much of the time these pairs do form AC pairs? \n\n\nFormatting - lower priority but would be good to aesthetically improve\n* Figure text sizes - the text on many of the figures is unreadable at a normal zoom level, try adjusting the matplotlib params to make these more readable. You can always move some into the appendix and leave one or two examples from each figure in the main text. Specially Fig 2, 3 and 6\n* Caption of Fig 7 is a bit unwieldy \n* Line 194 has a typo \u201ceven they\u201d -> \u201ceven though they\u201d ? \n\n\nThank you again for the work, I found the paper really enjoyable to read and showed strong scientific process. \nSome clarifying on a few points and tidying up of some of the figures are my main concerns, otherwise I find the work very solid."
