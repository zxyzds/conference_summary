    "title": "CROSS-CHANNEL ACTIVATION FUNCTION WITH PASS-THROUGH RATIO CONTROL",
    "abstract": "In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), activation layers process features from convolutional layers, which have multiple output channels. Conventional activation functions like ReLU handle these multi-channel features independently, ignoring spatial and cross-channel dependencies. This hard-thresholding approach can lead to information loss by eliminating negative features and disrupting the connection within input features. To address this issue, we propose a novel activation function that considers mutual relations across multiple channels. Our activation layer processes tuples across channels as single inputs, ensuring that output tuples remain in the same projection space, with their $\\ell_1$ norms bounded by a learnable parameter. This parameter controls the pass-through ratio, which is the proportion of input data allowed to pass through the activation layer, offering a significant advantage over ReLU. Our approach demonstrated superior accuracy in classification tasks on common benchmarks and domain-specific datasets for CNN-based models. The proposed activation layer outperformed ReLU and other common layers in both clean and noisy data scenarios, as confirmed by statistical tests. Our results highlight the effectiveness of this activation function in maintaining feature integrity and improving model performance.",

Is there a comparison between the proposed method and Leaky-ReLU?\n\n* This paper analyzes the pass-through ratio between the proposed SPA and ReLU. Honestly, I can't see a clear pattern indicating SPA is superior. Why would SPA outperform ReLU-like activation functions? In my understanding, the pass-through ratio of the ReLU-like activation function is controlled by the bias term in the convolutional layer or the linear layer, which is learned automatically during the training procedure with gradient descent. The proposed SPA actually adds a manually determined soft threshold $\\delta$ with very complicated computation to determine the set $\\mathcal{I}$ of unmasked channels. Is there any theoretical analysis to prove that SPA would outperform ReLU?\n\n* In lines 206-209, the authors claim that masking channel-wise feature (as in SPA) is better than masking element-wise feature (as in ReLU). Is there any theoretical or empirical evidence to support the claim? Would a more coarse-grained activation function lead to more information loss? In SPA, the output of some convolutional kernels is completely masked and set to zero."

                "value": "### Originality\n\nThe paper presents the Simplex Projection Activation (SPA) function, which introduces a novel approach to activation functions in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The originality of the paper lies in its consideration of cross-channel dependencies, which traditional activation functions like ReLU ignore. By projecting input tuples across channels onto a convex set, SPA maintains feature relations and avoids information loss, offering a creative solution to a known limitation in neural network design.\n\n### Quality\n\nThe quality of the paper is reflected in its thorough experimental evaluation. The authors have conducted extensive experiments across various datasets and noise conditions, demonstrating SPA's superiority over ReLU and other common activation functions. The statistical tests used to compare the accuracy of different activation functions are appropriate, and the results are consistently presented, indicating a high level of quality in the research methodology.\n\n### Clarity\n\nThe paper is generally well-structured and clear in its presentation. The problem statement is clearly defined, the motivation for the SPA function is well-articulated, and a relatively complete derivation process of the simplex method is provided. The use of illustrations and charts to help visualize concepts and results further enhances the clarity of the paper.\n\n### Significance\n\nThe significance of the paper is evident in its potential impact on the field of deep learning. SPA's ability to improve model performance and robustness to noise is a valuable contribution, especially given the widespread application of CNNs across various domains. The paper's findings could lead to improvements in the design of neural networks and potentially extend to other types of neural network architectures, highlighting the broader implications of the research.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper is strong in its original approach to addressing a known issue in CNNs, the quality of its experimental validation, the clarity of its presentation, and the significance of its potential impact on the field of deep learning. The research presented in this paper could influence future work in activation function design and neural network optimization."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Mistake in Mathematical Expression\n\nOne of the specific weaknesses in the paper is the definition of the set $S$ used in the SPA function. The paper states $S = \\{x = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_C] \\mid |x_1| + |x_2| + \\cdots + |x_C| \\leq \\delta\\}$ without explicitly requiring $x \\geq 0$. This omission may compromise the theoretical foundation, as the non-negativity constraint is crucial for the simplex projection and the activation function's behavior. The authors should clarify this condition to avoid any misinterpretation.\n\n### Misleading Illustration\n\nThe three-dimensional illustration in Figure 1(b) appears to be hand-drawn, with the projection directions of various points and the axes appearing inconsistent and chaotic, which may mislead readers. High-quality and accurate visual representation is crucial for conveying mathematical concepts, and the quality of this figure does not meet this standard. The authors should consider revising this figure using mathematical 3D space plotting tools such as GeoGebra to ensure it accurately represents the SPA projection without misleading readers.\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\nWhile the paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, it could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the SPA function. Specifically, the paper could explore the theoretical implications of the SPA function on network convergence and generalization. A more in-depth theoretical discussion would strengthen the paper's contribution and provide a stronger foundation for the experimental results.\n\n### Generalization to Other Network Architectures\n\nThe paper focuses on the application of SPA to CNNs, but does not extensively explore its potential application to other types of neural network architectures, such as transformer models. Expanding the scope of the paper to include experiments or a discussion on the applicability of SPA to these architectures would enhance its significance and impact.\n\n### Discussion on Limitations\n\nThe paper could benefit from a more explicit discussion on the limitations of the SPA function. For example, the authors could discuss potential challenges in optimizing the \u03b4 parameter for deep networks or the computational overhead introduced by the SPA function. Acknowledging and addressing these limitations would provide a more balanced view of the SPA function's practical applicability.\n\nIn summary, the paper's weaknesses can be addressed by clarifying mathematical definitions, improving visual representations, expanding the theoretical analysis, exploring the applicability to other network architectures, and discussing the limitations of the proposed method. By addressing these points, the paper could provide a more comprehensive and robust contribution to the field of neural network activation functions."

Are there any empirical results or theoretical predictions regarding SPA's applicability in other neural network architectures such as RNNs or transformer models?\n3. **Theoretical Analysis of SPA:** The paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the SPA function, particularly regarding network convergence and generalization.

Spatial relation refers to the local connectivity and neighborhood structure of the features, while cross-channel relation refers to the correlation and diversity of the features across different channels. \"\nIn my opinion, the convolutional operation already calculates the cross-channel relation of the features.
