    "title": "OMG: Opacity Matters in Material Modeling with Gaussian Splatting",
    "abstract": "Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.",

The entire formulation is physically sound and all the theoretical details are explained in an intuitive way for readers.\n4. Given the simplicity of this method, it should be broadly applicable to future 3DGS-based material modeling approaches, potentially making a significant impact to the community."

The work is inspired by the physical phenomenon that light intensity decays at different rates as it travels through different absorbing media. The authors map existing terms in the  GS formulation to terms in the Bouguer-Beer-Lambert law and add a new term predicted from albedo, metalness, and roughness, to cover the additional cross-section term. \n\nThe authors also provide nice interpretations of their formulation from other perspectives such as Nerf and Taylor expansion, thereby stressing the correctness of their approach.\n\nSince the method is plug-and-play, it was run on synthetic datasets containing glossy objects and also on real-world datasets such as Mip-nerf 360. Both the qualitative and quantitative results show that the method achieves high visual quality."

That facilitated understanding and also boosted the reader\u2019s confidence to a certain degree.\n\nThe method is plug and play, so if working well, it can have a big impact on how people model Gaussian Splats."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "It\u2019s surprising that this paper shows no result of transparent/translucent objects. I don\u2019t think it suffices for a method designed to handle transparent/tanslucent appearance to show improvements on opaque objects but not on the original objects of interest. Ideally, there should be videos of view synthesis results on translucent objects as evidence to what this paper claims.\n\n\nAssuming this method does handle translucency well, the big question mark in my head then is how the model deals with shape-material ambiguity. As a specific example: a cup could be due to regular cup geometry paired with regular cup material or cube geometry paired with a translucent material that\u2019s transparent everywhere and opaque around/in the center cup shape. There should be some analysis on why this is not happening if the paper properly models transparency/translucency. A specific experiment the authors can do is setting up a synthetic scene where a shape is enclosed by some translucent material. Does the model reconstruct the translucent part or just ignore it, reconstructing the object directly?\n\nAlso, current improvements reported in the paper on opaque objects may simply be due to a bigger model / gaussian formulation with more parameters we can optimize. If this is actually the case, the whole BBL law inspiration no longer stands.\n\nI am not fully convinced that the cross section network is really learning cross section from albedo, metalness, and roughness. In fact, I don\u2019t think that makes sense.  Consider a translucent material that has some cross section parameter for the network to learn. This material may not have well-defined albedo, metalness, or roughness, which are properties in opaque appearance BRDFs. I hope the authors can provide some clarifications around this (see also my questions below)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Related to the biggest weakness IMO above, have the authors tried this on translucent objects? If this doesn\u2019t work on those objects, the basis of this paper is fundamentally challenged.\n\nRelated to my final point in Weaknesses, have the authors tried to understand what the cross section network is learning? This can be done in many ways, but the one I have in mind is seeing how a trained network responds to varying inputs of roughness, metalness, and albedo. Again, I\u2019m very skeptical of the network learning anything physically-based. Why would albedo inform cross section? Again, they seem to be from two different worlds of material properties.\n\nNit: I like Figure 1a, but Figure 1b is misleading until I got to the very end of the paper, where the authors said their approach didn\u2019t model the dependency on light frequency. I recommend removing Figure 1b if color of the light doesn\u2019t matter in the entire paper."

Subtle improvement in Fig. 4. The comparison with R3DG on Synthetic4Relight dataset demonstrates little difference. I wonder if the authors can highlight some areas with more significant differences in the figure.\n4. Needs more geomentry comparison. The proposed cross section modeling provides a more physical constraint on the opacity, which I think can improve the constructed geometry. The experiment section has demonstrated qualitative results on normal maps, and I think the paper should include more quantitative comparisons on the reconstructed geometry, including normal accuaracy, and the extracted mesh if possible.\n5. Lack of interpretability in the cross section modeling. The paper simply uses an MLP to predict $\\sigma_\\nu$, which is an implicit mapping and lacks interpretability. Since the intuition of cross section modeling is based on the law of physics, the design should also be more reasonable.\n6. A minor suggestion: It will be better to use vector graphics (e.g. PDF or SVG) instead of bitmaps (e.g. PNG or JPG) in the figures."
