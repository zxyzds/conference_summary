    "title": "PhyMPGN: Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network for spatiotemporal PDE systems",
    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains.",

                "value": "The work focuses on solving PDE with low-resolution unstructured meshes. In particular, the authors incorporate the discrete Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator to express the diffusion process and a specific padding method to satisfy boundary conditions.\n\nThe experimental evaluation demonstrates that the introduced Laplace block (GNN + Laplace Beltrami operator) is strongly expressible to approximate Laplacian compared to the raw numerical scheme and machine learning models considered in the evaluation. In addition, the method has a stable prediction for long-time series prediction with generalization regarding initial condition, boundary condition, and Reynolds number to some extent."

Since the performance is better than the baseline, there might be a big improvement for the community, but it is unclear what it is. The author could have elaborated on what were the problems of existing methods and how they overcame the difficulties.\n* The method to treat boundary conditions in unstructured meshes is also not new and proposed in [Horie et al. NeurIPS 2022 https://openreview.net/forum?id=B3TOg-YCtzo ]. At least the author should mention existing works and possibly compare the proposed method with them to discuss the pros and cons.\n* For time-series training, the motivation to incorporate the first step in the loss (Eq 7). As mentioned in the paper, [Brandstetter et al. 2022] proposed a method called the pushforward trick, which computes the loss using only the last time step, demonstrating the trick performs better than adding noise. In the present work, Eq 7 seems to contradict the previous works. Thus, the authors should clarify the reason why they have the first step with noise and demonstrate the proposed one is better."

For instance, learning on coarse meshes and predicting on finer meshes or vice versa would be interesting to see, while that would be out-of-scope of the work."
