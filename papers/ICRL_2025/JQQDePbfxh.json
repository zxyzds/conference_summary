    "title": "Private Mechanism Design via Quantile Estimation",
    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of designing differentially private (DP), revenue-maximizing single item auction. Specifically, we consider broadly applicable settings in mechanism design where agents' valuation distributions are **independent**, **non-identical**, and can be either **bounded** or **unbounded**. Our goal is to design such auctions with **pure**, i.e., $(\\epsilon,0)$ privacy in polynomial time. \n\nIn this paper, we propose two computationally efficient auction learning framework that achieves **pure** privacy under bounded and unbounded distribution settings. These frameworks reduces the problem of privately releasing a revenue-maximizing auction to the private estimation of pre-specified quantiles. Our solutions increase the running time by polylog factors compared to the non-private version. As an application, we show how to extend our results to the multi-round online auction setting with non-myopic bidders. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to efficiently deliver a Myerson auction with **pure** privacy and near-optimal revenue, and the first to provide such auctions for **unbounded** distributions.",

                "value": "The paper investigates the problem of designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms for single-item auctions that maximize revenue while ensuring ($\\epsilon$, 0)-pure privacy. The authors propose two auction learning frameworks for both bounded and unbounded valuation distributions that privately estimate specific quantiles to achieve near-optimal revenue. Notably, the proposed frameworks maintain computational efficiency with only polylogarithmic overhead relative to non-private versions. Extending the approach to multi-round online auctions, the paper introduces mechanisms to limit strategic behavior from non-myopic bidders, demonstrating effectiveness in both bounded and unbounded distribution settings. The authors claim the method is the first efficient DP Myerson auction model under pure privacy and applicable to unbounded distributions."

This generalizes the iid setting of Huang et al (2018a) to the non-iid setting, answering their open question. This is a novel contribution to the online auction design literature.\n\n(S3) The private quantile estimation technique used in this work does not directly follow from previous work like Kaplan et al 2022.  The authors generalize previous techniques for distinct data points to the case with potentially identical data points.  This is an interesting contribution to the DP literature. \n\n(S4) The writing is very good. For example, the results and contributions are clearly stated in the introduction.

The model is that there are k \u201ctypes\u201d of users and in each round, we get k buyers sampled from the distribution (assumed to be i.i.d.). Myerson\u2019s foundational result defines the revenue maximizing truthful auction when the seller knows the distributions that the valuations are drawn from. In this work, the authors ask if we can privately learn enough about these distributions from samples to be able to run a near-optimal auction.\n\nThe main contribution is to show that indeed this is feasible. Using samples, one can learn the approximate quantiles of the distributions. Given the quantiles, the authors show that one can get a good approximation to the Myerson prices. In the case that the range of valuations is bounded, one can use any of the many known quantile estimation algorithms. In the case of unbounded range, one can use a recent result to estimate the range and then run quantile estimation.\n\nThe authors also show how for non-myopic bidders in a repeated game setting, one can use this private learning algorithm along with a commitment algorithm to get near optimal revenue."
