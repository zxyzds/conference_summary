    "abstract": "Geodemographic analysis is essential for understanding population characteristics and addressing socio-economic disparities across regions. However, limited research has been conducted on modelling changes in demographic data over time using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this study, we address this gap by leveraging GNNs to model correlations between the 2011 census data (England \\& Wales), observing changes over time, and the Output Area Classification 2021, which reflects socio-economic differences between Output Areas. We propose a novel framework that utilises Supervised Contrastive Learning on graphs to obtain robust OA embeddings, with a particular focus on improving the model\u2019s performance for minority classes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted two downstream tasks based on the 2021 OA embeddings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides valuable insights for geodemographic analysis and offers policymakers a useful tool for assessing socio-economic transitions over time, and planning ahead on the basis of it.",

By leveraging SCL to enhance classification accuracy for minority groups and using temporal data to observe socio-economic transitions, the model provides embeddings that policymakers could use to track and simulate regional socio-economic shifts."

Only a single dataset is used, and comparisons to relevant baselines are lacking.\n\nLack of baselines. The paper did not consider graph contrastive learning methods, including but not limited to the following:\nGraph contrastive learning with augmentations\nGraph contrastive learning automated\nInfogcl: Information-aware graph contrastive learning\nDeep graph contrastive representation learning\n\nThe paper could also benefit from more detailed analysis and examples of how the results and the proposed method translate into actionable insights in geodemographic contexts."

While the application is innovative, the core method of using graph-based SCL is based on existing approaches rather than introducing a significant technical novelty. This may limit the perceived originality of the work, as it primarily adapts known techniques for a new application.\n\n3. The experimental section would benefit from a comparison with non-GNN baselines, such as clustering algorithms, to highlight the unique advantages of the GNN approach. Including these baselines would make the results more compelling by providing a clearer perspective on the model's specific strengths and limitations relative to other methods.\n\n4.

It would be good to provide more justifications. It is also unclear in SCL+NN what is the NN being used (is it a CNN?). \n\n3) The empirical tasks are not very clearly explained. It seems OAC labels are being predicted but at the same time they are input to Algorithm 1. In addition, the empirical performance of the proposed SCL+NN approach does not seem encouraging enough against simple baselines, and the explanation for its poor performance is not entirely convincing."

Can the authors clarify?\n\n2) Giving that the geographical graph in Fig.1 looks planar and with relatively homogeneous node degrees, I am not sure if there are clear bottlenecks that would lead to over-squashing. It is also unclear why SCL would necessarily help with either over-smoothing or over-squashing.\n\n3) Clustering and classification are typically treated as different problems. The paper somewhat mixed these two (eg in 2.2) which makes reading confusing at times.\n\n4) The difference between SCL+GNN and GNN is not very clear (at least according to the description in 4.2)."

More ablation studies that consider different GNNs can be conducted.\n6. Detailed settings of all approaches should be introduced to improve the reproducibility of the paper.
