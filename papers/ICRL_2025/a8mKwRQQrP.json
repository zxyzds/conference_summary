    "title": "Online Policy Selection for Inventory Problems",
    "abstract": "We tackle online inventory problems where at each time period the manager makes a replenishment decision based on partial historical information in order to meet demands and minimize costs. To solve such problems, we build upon recent works in online learning and control, use insights from inventory theory and propose a new algorithm called GAPSI. This algorithm follows a new feature-enhanced base-stock policy and deals with the troublesome question of non-differentiability which occurs in inventory problems. Our method is illustrated in the context of a complex and novel inventory system involving multiple products, lost sales, perishability, warehouse-capacity constraints and lead times. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the good performances of our algorithm on real-world data.",

                "value": "The authors address the challenge of inventory control in dynamic, real-world scenarios, where managers must make sequential replenishment decisions based on past data rather than assuming known demand distributions. It introduces an algorithm built on the Online Policy Selection framework. The approach leverages adaptive learning rates and feature-enhanced base-stock policies to model and manage inventory systems more flexibly. The paper demonstrates the potential of online learning methods for realistic inventory optimization."

Safety stock (s,S) policies are much more common in practice and nicely capture fixed costs. \n\nI read with enthusiasm the arguments and illustrations why non-differentiable points are important. However how to copy with this issue left me empty handed. The solution proposed is very simple and begs for additional exploration (for example, in reLU at zero any number in [0,1] is a gradient) and thus selecting the left gradient might not be 'optimal.'\n\nPerhaps the weakest point is that the weights in the parametric policy must be determine by hand. This is a very tall order and a very questionable requirement. \n\nConducting abundant research in inventory management in my early career, the paper uses many established principles and concepts. On the optimization side, there are very few novel ideas (that really don't rely on aspects of inventory management). \n\nThe appendix is a dumpster of many topics, most of them known by prior works."

This is mainly because the inventory problem violates some of the assumptions needed for the analysis of GAPS [2]. However, there are other papers that provides theoretical bounds on policy gradient methods for inventory control, see, e.g. [3][4], and thus I believe some similar bounds could also be obtained for GAPSI. Can you thus provide some theoretical bounds for GAPSI?\n\n[1] Nesterov, Y. (2005). Smooth minimization of non-smooth functions. Mathematical programming, 103, 127-152.\n\n[2] Lin, Y., Preiss, J.

Due to a series of problems like 'policies, losses, and transitions are not differentiable, thus neither classical chain rules nor smoothness apply,' the authors have not provided a regret analysis.

If that's the case, I feel that this article is more like a heuristic guidance manual for inventory management that could be posted on arXiv or SSRN. \n\nMy concern is that this article resembles a case study, lacking comprehensive theoretical proof and large-scale real-world practice, so I would only give it a score of 5."

The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm; however, the experimental section could be more rigorous.
