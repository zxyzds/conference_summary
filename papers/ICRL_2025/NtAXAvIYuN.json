    "title": "$i$REPO: $i$mplicit Reward Pairwise Difference based Empirical Preference Optimization",
    "abstract": "While astonishingly capable, large Language Models (LLM) can sometimes produce outputs that deviate from human expectations. Such deviations necessitate an alignment phase to prevent disseminating untruthful, toxic, or biased information. Traditional alignment methods based on reinforcement learning often struggle with the identified instability, whereas preference optimization methods are limited by their overfitting to pre-collected hard-label datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM alignment framework named $i$REPO, which utilizes implicit Reward pairwise difference regression for Empirical Preference Optimization. Particularly, $i$REPO employs self-generated datasets labeled by empirical human (or AI annotator) preference to iteratively refine the aligned policy through a novel regression-based loss function. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative algorithm backed by theoretical guarantees for achieving optimal results under ideal assumptions and providing a practical performance-gap result without such assumptions. Experimental results with Phi-2 and Mistral-7B demonstrate that $i$REPO effectively achieves self-alignment using soft-label, self-generated responses and the logit of empirical AI annotators. Furthermore, our approach surpasses preference optimization baselines in evaluations using the Language Model Evaluation Harness and Multi-turn benchmarks.",

                "value": "The paper presents iREPO, an empirical preference optimization framework for language model alignment, grounded in theoretical exploration with an emphasis on iterative feedback mechanisms. While the paper is structured well and includes clear algorithmic steps, the experimental design is weak, as iREPO, an online method, is primarily compared to offline baselines. This choice undermines the validity of the results, as offline methods generally face limitations in out-of-distribution scenarios, which are not an issue for online methods. Furthermore, the use of non-state-of-the-art models like Phi-2 and Mistral-7B weakens the contribution, making it difficult to assess iREPO\u2019s potential on current high-performing models such as LLaMA 3. The approach lacks novelty, offering incremental rather than transformative improvements to preference optimization. Key questions remain, particularly regarding the rationale for comparing iREPO with offline methods, how it would perform on state-of-the-art models, and its robustness in real-world settings with distributional shifts. Overall, the paper falls short in demonstrating strong empirical evidence and addressing practical concerns for broader applicability."

To demonstrate iREPO\u2019s robustness and generalizability, it would be more insightful to test on current high-performing models like LLaMA 3.

First, the main contribution of the paper is a new offline objective for alignment. A more informative experiment would be to compare the method first in a completely offline setting as follows: Take a SFT model, sample D completions per prompt, get preference labels for each pair. Use iREPO to regress onto the strength of preference (with and without filtering down to weakest/strongest pair), but there are many ways to compute ranking here and you could consider putting in all the preferences into DPO/IPO too (as they are implicitly ranking losses).\n- More experimental evidence would help, as a lot of these evaluations are fairly noisy.\n- In general, the paper needs to justify why expending this additional effort on collecting preference label is justified. The claim can be backed by showing better performance / unit of annotation effort. Or you could show that these preference labels result in higher signal-to-noise ratio for preferences, and can be scaled better."

Since, iREPO filters down comparison to strongest vs weakest comparison, could you reduce the annotation burden?\n- Since you are computing the logit to regress to, why not regress to the logit for all pairs of comparisons instead of filtering down to the comparison of the strongest and weakest completion pair? For other methods where strength of preference cannot be determined, filtering makes sense as they are treated similarly (with a hard preference label). However, since you have notion of \"strength\" of preference that you are regressing to, I'd be curious to see the results where you do not filter preference pairs.\n- UltraFeedback and other datasets are based on GPT-4 labels, does labeling with DeBERTa introduces a mismatch in the preference function, especially with MT-Bench with uses GPT-4 to evaluate model preferences again?\n- Could you elaborate how the new labels collected, during iteration 1 and 2? How are the labels computed for iter-DPO and iter-IPO? I am worried the comparison isn't fair.\n- Could you provide more detail on how the number of annotators change the preference labels/performance of iREPO?"

There seems to be a disconnect between the description of DPO and IPO across multiple sections. Until section 3, the authors refer to vanilla DPO/IPO. In the experiments, the authors use iterative DPO/IPO as the baseline without describing the iterative version of the algorithm.\n4. It seems like simply increasing the number of annotators does not lead to better alignment. Infact, this seems like a strange hyperparameter to tune.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My major concern is the contribution of the algorithm and the theoretical analysis listed as below\n\n- In section 4.1, the delivered message, specifically $w_i / (w_i + w_j) = h_{ij} / (h_{ij} + h_{ji})$ is somewhat trivial. The rationale behind highlighting this equivalence is unclear, as it does not seem to directly address any core technical challenges. A stronger connection to the problem statement or contribution would help clarify the authors\u2019 intent here.\n- In section 4.2, The proposed method employs the square loss to approximate the binary distribution, defined as $L = E[(p - p^)^2]$. The authors do not provide a clear reason for selecting this loss function over the more conventional KL divergence, $L = E(\\mathrm{KL}(p \\parallel p^))$, which is typically a \u201csoft\u201d version of cross-entropy loss. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify why KL divergence was deemed unsuitable for this application and how the square loss better serves the purpose of approximating the distribution $p$.\n- In addition, the algorithm requires repeated evaluations of $h$ for each individual preference pair $(i, j)$. The authors should clarify why this $h$-step data cannot be directly used within DPO but instead must be aggregated into a squared loss function. For fair comparison, given that $h = 5, 9, 15, 21$ were chosen in the appendix, the iterative DPO dataset should ideally leverage these same values ($h = 5, 9, 15, 21$) rather than a single annotator in vanilla iterative DPO. A clarification on this point is necessary.\n- In section 4.3, the theoretical justification here requires further detail. For example, Assumption 4.1 cannot hold universally for any $P_h$. The authors may want to define the releasability on the ground truth $P^$, indicating that $P_h \\to P^$ as $h \\to \\infty$ (per Assumption 4.2). However, this assumption may be also impractical, as it requires a significantly large $h$. Moreover, the theoretical analysis as presented is insufficient. For example, equation (18) essentially states that if $L = (p - q)^2 = 0$, then $D_{TV}(p, q) = 0$, which is self-evident. Similarly, equation (19) mirrors the DPO analysis. Furthermore, the role of $C_t$ in Theorem 4.5 is not well-explained, especially within the online iterative framework. A more thorough explanation of these theoretical points would strengthen the analysis.\n- The authors should explicit show the selection of $h$ in the main paper. \n\n### Regarding the proof in the appendix, here're a few issues I'm suggesting to revise.\n- When applying the mean-value theorem, the correct expression is $|\\sigma(x_1) - \\sigma(x_2)| = \\Big|\\sigma\u2019(x_0)\\Big| \\times  |x_1 - x_2|$ (with absolute value of $|\\sigma'(x_0)|$ rather than simply $\\sigma\u2019(x_0)|x_1 - x_2|$, though this does not affect the correctness of the proof.\n- In line 810, this is a concentration inequality rather than the law of large numbers. The scaling factor of $O(1 / \\sqrt{n})$ relies on certain conditions, which should be explicitly verified by the authors (e.g. Hoeffding's inequality with R-sub-Gaussian). The law of large numbers only guarantees convergence to zero but does not provide scale guarantees."
