    "abstract": "With the commercial deployment of increasingly larger and more complex neural networks at the cloud and the edge in recent years, inference has become too costly in terms of compute workload worldwide. Adaptive inference methods, which dynamically adjust a neural network's size or structure during inference, offer a means to enhance efficiency of neural networks beyond what static network compression and optimization methods can fundamentally achieve.\n\nThis paper introduces the first theoretical framework for quantifying the efficiency and performance gain opportunity size of adaptive inference algorithms. We provide new approximate and exact bounds for the achievable efficiency and performance gains, supported by empirical evidence demonstrating the potential for 10-100x efficiency improvements in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks without incurring any performance penalties. Additionally, we offer insights on improving achievable efficiency gains through the optimal selection and design of adaptive inference state spaces.",

                "value": "This work provides a theoretical framework for quantifying the adaptive inference opportunity space. The authors introduce a notion of adaptive agents which select between multiple classifiers of varying accuracies and resource costs given data to classify. They introduce the notion of an oracle agent which alway selects the classifier with the lowest resource costs without hampering accuracy. Using the oracle agent, they derive expressions for its resource cost and accuracy as a function of the probability that smaller classifiers overcome errors made by larger models. These expressions form conservative and empirically grounded upper bounds on the resource-accuracy frontier achievable for agents on various datasets."

                "value": "Theoretical bounds are most useful when they provide a prescription for how to empirically close the gap, but the bounds provided in this work are too generic to provide such insight. Suppose I have an agent with the optimal number of states as defined in Section 4.1.1, but it is not achieving the accuracy-resource trade-off predicted by the theory. How can I relate quantities of interest in my adaptive inference algorithm to terms in Eq. 10?\n- See Question 1 and 2 for actionable suggestions\n\nThe model provided assumes all costs are part of a single ordered resource value and all objectives are part of a single ordered accuracy value. This oversimplifies the search space and does not allow an agent to balance multiple resource optimizations or consider multiple objectives.\n- For example, sparse MoE also facilitates domain adaptation in LLMs (GLaM https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/du22c/du22c.pdf, Meta-DMoE https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/8bd4f1dbc7a70c6b80ce81b8b4fdc0b2-Paper-Conference.pdf). In these cases, a single accuracy metric seems insufficient to capture the goals of the agent.\n- A simpler case is when resources are split across memory and compute. There could be several states in the $(R_i, A_i)$ space that are equivalent on a single resource axis but different when split across two resources axes.\n- See Question 3 for actionable suggestions"

                "value": "1. How could someone map these results to improve an agent? For example, taking a standard sparse MoE agent, how would I identify why my agent fails to achieve better trade-offs as predicted by the theory? Perhaps you can work through an example case-study in the text.\n2. If the current theory does not provide prescriptive guidelines for improving an agent, are there changes (e.g. to $\\alpha_i$) that could facilitate this? Perhaps expressing $A_i$ and $R_i$ in terms of the specific adaptive inference algorithms' parameters will help. Similar to Question 1, you could either include a case study on this or expand on the discussion in Section 4.2. I recommend referring to a specific adaptive inference technique.\n3. Have you considered how this theory would extend to multiple resource or accuracy axes? Are there suggestions you can make for future work (e.g. changes to Eq. 4-7) to facilitate multiple axes?"

                "value": "**General**\n- Since the paper is proposing a *theoretical* framework, it could benefit from more rigorous mathematical definitions and a less convoluted style of expressing, explaining, and reasoning about these. See *Specific* part below.\n- There is no related work section.\n- Paragraph structures could be improved greatly. There are many paragraphs which consist of a single one or two line sentence.\n\n**Specific**\n> However, such efficiency advancements have reached a plateau, necessitating fundamentally new techniques that extend beyond the design space of conventional static neural network optimization methods.\n\nHave they? I'm no expert in that particular field, but I was under the impression that, especially with the rise of *large* language models we saw over the last two years, these fields (compression, pruning, quantization) were thriving. It would be great if the authors would provide relevant sources to these claims.\n\n> Let $A_i$ represent the test accuracy of classifier $i$ represented with $S_i$.\n\nIs this with respect to a specific dataset that the classifier $i$ was trained on (the test set from the same distribution), is this the hypothetical dataset the classifier is being tested/evaluated on when the oracle agent as applied, or what exactly does this accuracy relate to?\n\n> Given the definition of the adaptation state space, an adaptive agent aims to identify an optimal strategy that maximizes average performance ($A$) and minimizes the average resource consumption ($R$) by selecting the optimal adaptation state ($S_i$) for each given input $x$.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> 2.2 The Oracle Agent\n>\n> An Oracle Agent is defined as an agent equipped with simultaneous knowledge of both resource consumption and the accuracy (i.e. correctness) of all models for each instance $x$. As a result, it can choose the adaptation state with the lowest resource consumption while still achieving the highest accuracy possible (within the constraints of the adaptation state space) for every classified instance.\n\nHow is \"the optimal adaptation state ($S_i$)\" defined? What does it mean to be optimal? Let's say we have $S_1 = (R_1=10, A_1=95%)$ and $S_2 = (R_2=20, A_2=97%)$, which state should be preferred? Doesn't this require a scoring function $f$ that depends on $R_i$ and $A_i$, such that we can actually define an \"optimal\" state, w.r.t. $f$?\n\n\nDefinition 2.1 states the Oracle Agent strategy ($R_{oracle}(x) = \\min_i(R_i) \\text{ s.t. } Y_i(x) = Y_{GT}(x)$ and $R_1$ else) which seems to be independent of the classifier accuracy $A_i$? According to Section 2.2, the Oracle Agent strategy is supposed to find \"the optimal adaption state\" based on the resources $R_i$ **and** the accuracies $A_i$?\n\nSection 2.2.1 goes on and states the *expected* resource consumption $R_{oracle}$ and accuracy $A_{oracle}$ achieved by such an Oracle. This part could greatly benefit from more rigorous mathematical definitions to be able to follow why the authors decide on certain formulations. If we are looking at expectations, why not express the expected resource consumption and accuracy as $\\mathbb{E}[R_{oracle}] = \\sum_i R_i \\cdot P(R_i)$ with $P(R_i)$ being the probability, that the agent chose state $S_i$, which only happens, when all classifiers $< i$ made an error ($E_i := Y_i \\neq Y_{GT}$), leading to $P(R_i) = P(E_1, \\dots, E_{i-1}, \\overline{E_i})$. This is exactly the quantity that the authors define in Appendix A.2 as $P(x_i) = P(e_{i-1}) - P(e_i)$ with $x_i := \\{Y_1 \\neq Y_{GT} \\cap \\dots \\cap Y_1 = Y_{GT}\\}$ (which is an odd naming choice since $x$ is already defined as the datapoint) and $e_i := \\{Y_1 \\neq Y_{GT} \\cap \\dots \\cap Y_1 \\neq Y_{GT}\\}$.\n\nSecondly, the authors state the expected accuracy $A_{oracle} = 1 - P(e_N)$ without any derivation or explanation. Since $P(e_N)$ is the probability, that *all* models fail, $1 - P(e_N)$ is the probability, that at least one (or more) model is correct. I cannot follow the reasoning of why this holds, looking at the formulation of the expected value of $A_{oracle}$, we get $\\mathbb{E}[A_{oracle}] = \\sum_i A_i \\cdot P(A_i)$, where $P(A_i) = P(E_1, \\dots, E_{i-1}, \\overline{E_i})$ which is the probability, that we pick state $S_i$ (same as $P(R_i)$) -- why should this \"collapse\" to $1 - P(e_i) = 1 - P(E_1, \\dots, E_i)$? Appendix A.2 \"Proof of Eq. (5)\" also does not derive this quantity and simply states the same equation again in Eq. (12).\n\nThe authors then go on to rewrite $P(e_i)$ as $\\alpha_i (1 - A_i)$ (for $i>1$) with $\\alpha_i = P(Y_1 \\neq Y_{GT} \\cap \\dots \\cap Y_{i-1} \\neq Y_{GT} | Y_i \\neq Y_{GT})$ and then rewrite $R_{oracle}$ and $A_{oracle}$ using $\\alpha_i$ in Eq. (7). Why are we interested in the quantity $\\alpha_i$? Looking at the events, this is the probability, that all classifiers $<i$ fail, given that classifier $i$ failed. The authors state in L202, that larger $\\alpha_i$ implies that it is unlikely, that a smaller model can correctly classify what a larger model misclassified and smaller $\\alpha_i$ implies that it is likely, that a smaller model can correctly classify what a larger model misclassified -- okay, this is simply how $\\alpha_i$ was defined, but why do we need this for the Oracle Agent?\n\nAfterward, the authors claim\n\n> The resource consumption and accuracy of an Oracle Agent calculated using this equation can serve as an upper bound on the performance and efficiency achievable by any adaptive agent\n\nWhy exactly is the *expected* resource consumption and accuracy an upper bound on the performance (accuracy?) and efficiency (resource consumption?)?\n\n> On the other hand, $\\alpha_i$ captures the cross-dependencies among the entire set of backbone models, a detail often not reported for static off-the-shelf models\n\nWithout the authors having defined what they imply by \"cross-dependencies among the entire set of backbone models\", I assume, that it means that $(Y_j \\neq Y_{GT}) \\perp\\\\!\\\\\\!\\\\!\\perp (Y_k \\neq Y_{GT})$ (independence) does not hold. I think this is wrong, since $\\alpha_i$ is a conditional probability (conditioned on the event $Y_i \\neq Y_{GT}$) which then only covers the conditional independence $(Y_j \\neq Y_{GT}) \\perp\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\perp (Y_k \\neq Y_{GT}) | Y_i \\neq Y_{GT}$ with $j < i$ and $k < i$.\n\n> Figure 2: Empirical Measurements of $\\alpha_i$ for different tasks and models. $\\alpha_i$ remains relatively constant for models with similar architecture.\n\nThe figure shows a graph with four plot lines. *All* of them decrease in value $\\alpha_i$ with increasing $i$. Saying $\\alpha_i$ remains *relatively constant* sounds hand wavy and not scientific at all to me, simply to justify a constant $\\alpha$, which is being used in the rest of the body.\n\n> As previously discussed, $\\alpha_i$ serves as a measure of the probability that a large model making a classification error leads to errors in all of the smaller models\n\nHow does \"a large model making a classification error lead to errors in all of the smaller models\"? It is simply a probability distribution over events happening (classifiers being correct/wrong), capturing correlation and **not causation**.\n\nI've continued reading the rest of the paper (Section 3 to 6) in detail. Unfortunately, since, as explained above, I'm lost on the reasoning of the choice for most of the definitions in the essential Section 2, I wasn't able to appreciate and follow the results in the later sections.\n\nI hope that I didn't severely misunderstand something which left me confused for the rest of the paper, but as it is written now, the essential Section 2 needs to be greatly improved to clarify most of what I've said above. I'm happy to discuss the details with the authors, and I'm interested to see if other reviewers were able to make sense of Section 2."

How is complexity determined at inference without a priori knowledge?\n- The paper often relies on the constant-\u03b1 approximation, which may oversimplify model dependency in adaptive systems. This assumption may not hold for heterogeneous architectures or diverse datasets.\n- The framework implicitly assumes the adaptive gains would generalise across different tasks and data distributions without rigorous testing. Given that models might perform inconsistently across various domains, the generalisation of adaptive efficiency gains seems optimistic.\n- The framework is tested on only two datasets (ImageNet for CV and HellaSwag for NLP), which limits the demonstration of its general adaptability across tasks and different dataset dimensions.\n- Theoretical derivations and equations, especially around the Oracle Agent, lack intuitive explanations, which might make it difficult for readers to understand the assumptions and implications of key equations."

This weakens the support for the authors\u2019 claims and raises questions about the practical feasibility of achieving the claimed efficiency improvements."
