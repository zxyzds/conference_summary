    "title": "Revisiting the Design Choices in Max-Return Sequence Modeling",
    "abstract": "Decision Transformer (DT), free from optimal value functions fitting and policy gradient computation, attempts to solve offline reinforcement learning (RL) via supervised sequence modeling. During inference, sequence modeling requires an initial target returns assigned with expert knowledge, which blocks comprehensive evaluation on more diverse datasets. As a result, existing sequence modeling only focuses on limited evaluation on Gym datasets and some understanding is severely biased. In this paper, we aim to revisit the design choices, including architecture and context length, in sequence modeling on more diverse datasets. We utilize the max-return sequence modeling that replaces the manual target returns with maximized returns predicted by itself. We systematically investigate the impact of 1) architectural choices and 2) context lengths in max-return sequence modeling on nine datasets with varying data distributions. Abundant experiments and thorough analyses reveal that design choices are highly influenced by the dataset characteristics, which further underscores the significance of more diverse evaluation.",

                "value": "This paper is an investigation of offline RL and max-return sequence models. Three architectures, Reinformer, Reinconver, and Reimba; 9 standard continuous control offline RL datasets; and different context lengths are investigated. The authors find that with a diverse enough evaluation, no method truly comes out on top. They also find that model and hyperparameter order appears to heavily depend on the environment, and the data quality of the replay buffer. This is particularly visible with the effect of training and inference context length. For the latter, the authors expand on previous results and show that well-thought masking can help models at inference perform well with only few steps of context (even if they are trained with many steps)."

                "value": "Maybe the most unsatisfying part is that this paper feels like it scratches the surface of many things, without going really into depth in one of the presented aspects. A next-level version of this paper would focus on one thing only and ask much deeper mechanistic questions; why are things the way they are? What are the right ways to measure that? Does this lead to (potential) novel methods?\n\nFor example, the authors could focus on the dataset quality. What happens when we go from `random` to `medium` to `expert`? What happens if we take the `expert` dataset and corrupt it? Take subsets of it of varying quality? Introduce distractors? I think it's fairly obvious to any ML researcher that data quality deeply affects ML models; the better question to answer is what specifically in the data has an impact? In RL we know there's tons of domain-specific structure (e.g. time), so we have the occasion to ask way more specific mechanistic questions of our models.\n\nOn one hand, I appreciate this paper and its \"retrospectiveness\", and it raises important questions. On the other hand, I think a much stronger version of this paper could exist e.g. as I suggest above, and I don't see this paper being a very strong contribution in the sense of being impactful to offline RL researchers other than as a regular call to order for papers to take diverse benchmarking seriously."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In 5.2.1, the authors use a \"0\" token, but presumably the model has never (or rarely?) seen this. Why not just compute the Jacobian or some similar quantity to see the dependence of the prediction on past inputs? Or am I wrong an the models actually do see mask tokens?\n- \"Thus, the Reinformer pays more attention to global information\", this is an interesting observation, but it doesn't translate to supporting a claim the architecture impacts performance. If different architectures \"weigh\" temporal information differently but have the exact same policy logits, are they really different? There needs to be a more causal/mechanistic claim here.\n- There's a fair amount of speculation (especially about environment properties) that feels hidden in the text, for example, the authors claim that \"the Reinformer\u2019s focus on global historical trajectory information is particularly adept at considering and utilizing waypoint-related information effectively.\" This is speculation from (a) Figure 2 (b) and the authors' understanding of `maze-large`. A better, and less speculative, experiment would directly intervene on the agent to test a hypothesis; for example in this case, the agents could be made to \"cheat\" by being given waypoint information, and if this intervention removes the Reinformer's superiority, then we've learned that the other models are probably worse at modeling this specifically.\n- Is the x axis inverted on Figures 3 and 4 and 6b? Table 2 (and the text) suggests e.g. that Reinformer is superior to Reimba on `Maze2d-large`.\n- \"Correspondingly, a smaller context length aligns more closely with the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, and thus performs better.\" I'm not sure this conclusion naturally follows. If I understand correctly, the argument is that offline RL on a worse & diverse replay buffer means more effective capacity is spent modeling unimportant states, which means that we should show less of them at a time to be closer to a 1-Markov setting. To me this is not obviously true because even with a lower K, the model still sees all the states as part of its training data, and is still spending effective capacity on them regardless of the sequence in which they appear. To me a more plausible reason is that _credit assignment_ is harder if the model has to consider many possible explanations (i.e. K times more) for the output; or in other words with longer inputs the variance is larger. But this could be demonstrated empirically rather than through speculation."

Table 4 suggests a linear relationship between the performance and context length $K$. Could you discuss the reason for choosing to model these relationships linearly? And, if I was not mistaken, in this regression analysis, $K$ values are limited to the discrete support of $\\{2,5,10,20\\}$, which may not accurately reflect the relationship by the interpolation. Presenting these plots visually assessing this relationship could provide clearer evidence of linearity or indicate the need for a different modeling approach, such as polynomial regression or categorically treating each $K$ value. Alternatively, more detailed justification for the chosen method would help clarify the rationale behind this modeling choice."
