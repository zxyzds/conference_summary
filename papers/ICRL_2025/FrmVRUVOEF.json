    "title": "Temporally coherent visualisation of time-dependent data",
    "abstract": "Dimension reduction algorithms aim to embed high-dimensional datasets into a low-dimensional space in such a way that important structural properties, such as clusters and manifolds, are preserved. Most such methods are designed for static data, and naively applying them to time-dependent data can lead to unstable embeddings which do not meaningfully capture the temporal evolution of the data. In this paper, we propose a new variant of the t-SNE algorithm for time-dependent data, TC-tSNE (Temporally Coherent t-SNE) in which an extra term is added to the cost function to promote temporal coherence: the notion that a data point which has a similar position in two time frames should be embedded to similar positions at those times. Importantly, this notion captures temporal similarities over the entire time domain and can therefore capture long-range temporal patterns, not just local ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for visualising dynamic network embedding, and we evaluate our method on six benchmark datasets using a collection of metrics, which capture the structural quality and the temporal coherence of the embeddings. We compare our method with existing dynamic visualisation algorithms and find that it performs competitively.",

In particular, it is not clear how the method works on datasets with periodic changes or anomalies.\n\n(W2) The experiments in Figure 4 show no significant advantage compared to previous methods. For instance in the sort dataset TC-tSNE fairs much lower than competitors in terms of spatial consistency.\n\n(W3) There are no experiments showing the impact of hyperparameters ($\\lambda$ for instance) on the results. Is the parameter $\\lambda$ to be tuned for any dataset or does there exist a good configuration that holds with different data?\n\n(W4) \u00ccn line 388 other dimensionality reduction techniques are used to show the results in Figure 1. However, since TC-tSNE is already a dimensionality reduction method, why not use that directly?\n\n(W5) Clarity: The paper should report how to compute the evaluation metrics and their meaning.\n\n(W6) The paper states that they report the average of four metrics. How can you average across different metrics?\n\n(W7) The paper claims that its methodology generally applies to different embeddings, yet it shows the applications only with TSNE. How can it be applied to UMAP? Some experiments in this regard should be shown.\n\n(W8) The paper proposes a notion of temporal coherence that considers all timestamps t using Eq. 3. However, this definition is problematic and sensitive to outliers and fluctuating behaviours. In particular, if the point at some time t deviates substantially from another at time t+k, then the temporal coherence would try to smoothen these points far apart, but among other time stamps instead the opposite behaviour can be observed.\n\n(W9) Building on W3. While it is clear the motivation that a single timestamp is not sufficient, it is not clear why an unweighted sum of coherence across timestamps is sound. Wouldn't be better to discount points further in time from t? Why not consider a weighted sum?\n\n### Minor:\n\n(M1) Typos:\n\n- 127: Describe an variant\n- 136: The sentence is broken and has no conclusion"

For example, in the formula shown in line 101, many variables (such as n, T, and \u03bb) are not timely explained, with some variables only clarified in Section 3.1, while the parameter \ud835\udf06 is not defined anywhere in the paper. Line 257 references equation (3.2), but this equation does not appear in the text. Additionally, which two papers are referred to in line 381 as \"Both of the aforementioned papers\"?\n2.Although the experimental display in the paper is quite intuitive, it does not present any quantitative data. Currently, in Figure 4, it is unclear which hyperparameter was used for each data point in the experiments. The authors might consider using tables to present some important results, with the complete results provided in the appendix.\n3.The experiments in the paper are insufficient. On one hand, the paper uses t-SNE as the spatial cost function and SNE as the temporal cost function. The rationale for this is that clustering may not be meaningful in the temporal domain, as explained in line 179. However, this claim lacks corresponding experimental evidence. Moreover, did the authors try using other cost functions? On the other hand, in line 259, it is stated that the proposed method can be easily plugged into accelerated algorithms; did the authors conduct related experiments?\n4.Figure 3 presents the performance of other methods and aims to compare it with the performance of the proposed method shown in Figure 1. However, Figures 1 and 3 use different vertical scales, making it difficult to make a fair visual comparison."

                "value": "1.Line 111 describes the \"Guided\" method, but it does not analyze its limitations as done earlier in the text. Since this method does not solely guarantee short-term temporal coherence and does not significantly impact spatial quality like the \"Global\" method, what specific problems does the proposed method address in relation to the \"Guided\" method?\n2.In line 394, the hyperparameters used in the TC-tSNE method are described. Were these hyperparameters selected based on experience or experiments?\n3.The experimental results presented in Figure 4 are not convincing. For example, the performance of Global PCA appears to be similar to or even better than that of the proposed method, except on the fashion dataset.\n4.Is there any open-source code available to replicate the experimental results in this paper to enhance credibility?"

Further, the result analysis given in the paper is too brief (\u201csometimes achieving the best temporal and spatial metrics, and is never among the worst\u201d), which does not provide much insight into the obtained results; a more in-depth discussion and analysis would be needed.\n\nW3.
