    "title": "Series-to-Series Diffusion Bridge Model",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have risen to prominence in time series forecasting, showcasing their robust capability to model complex data distributions. However, their effectiveness in deterministic predictions is often constrained by instability arising from their inherent stochasticity. In this paper, we revisit time series diffusion models and present a comprehensive framework that encompasses most existing diffusion-based methods. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel diffusion-based time series forecasting model, the Series-to-Series Diffusion Bridge Model ($\\mathrm{S^2DBM}$), which leverages the Brownian Bridge process to reduce randomness in reverse estimations and improves accuracy by incorporating informative priors and conditions derived from historical time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that $\\mathrm{S^2DBM}$ delivers superior performance in point-to-point forecasting and competes effectively with other diffusion-based models in probabilistic forecasting.",

Additionally, it needs to be clarified whether the values of \\(\\hat{\\alpha}_t\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta}_t\\), and \\(\\gamma_t\\) should have a specific relationship to conform to the diffusion model.\n2. In line 411, it is mentioned that a comparison with timediff was made, but Table 2 does not include TimeDiff data while other baselines are present.\n3. The content of the paper appears to primarily build on existing work by combining the model guidance from TMDM and the non-autoregressive approach of timediff with the existing Brownian Bridge process. This integration seems to lack novelty."

In Line 259, the title of Proposition 1 is \"Brownian Bridge between Historical and Predicted Time Series.\" However, the Brownian bridge\u2019s endpoint is set to $h$, the Prior Predictor\u2019s forecasted value of $x$. The paper provides no explanation as to why $h$ is chosen as the endpoint for the Brownian bridge. \n2. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify, from a theoretical perspective, why the Brownian bridge is integrated into the diffusion model for time series forecasting. Specifically, how does its ability to \"pin down\" the diffusion process at both ends help reduce instability from noisy inputs and enable the accurate generation of future features based on historical time series?\n3. In line 195, Theorem 1 concerns non-autoregressive diffusion processes. However, the summarized models, CSDI and SSSD, do not appear to be non-autoregressive models. Could there be an issue with the theorem here?"
