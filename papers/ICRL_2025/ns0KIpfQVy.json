    "title": "Multimodal Banking Dataset: Understanding Client Needs through Event Sequences",
    "abstract": "Financial organizations collect a huge amount of data about clients that typically\nhas a temporal (sequential) structure and is collected from various sources (modal-\nities). Due to privacy issues, there are no large-scale open-source multimodal\ndatasets of event sequences, which significantly limits the research in this area. In\nthis paper, we present the industrial-scale publicly available multimodal banking\ndataset, MBD, that contains more than 2M corporate clients with several modal-\nities: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of dia-\nlogues with technical support and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank\u2019s\nproducts. All entries are properly anonymized from real proprietary bank data.\nUsing this data, we introduce a novel multimodal benchmark that incorporates\ntwo open-source finansical datasets.We provide numerical results demonstrating\nour multimodal baselines\u2019 superiority over single-modal techniques for each task.\nAs a result, the proposed dataset and benchmark can open new perspectives and\nfacilitate the future development of practically important large-scale multimodal\nalgorithms for event sequences.",

Additionally, the experimental section presents insufficient comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods. Overall, the paper's innovativeness needs improvement. I suggest that the authors include more experiments involving fully supervised methods [1][2]. Additionally, it would be beneficial to propose a simple and practical innovative approach based on their dataset.\n[1]Learning Deep Time-index Models for Time Series Forecasting.

Additionally, the expression in the paper is not sufficiently clear, making it difficult for readers to accurately understand certain points and arguments.
