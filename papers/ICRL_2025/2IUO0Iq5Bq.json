    "title": "Fast Tensor-Based Multi-View Clustering with Anchor Probability Transition Matrix",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering effectively integrates information from multiple data representations, yet current methods face key challenges. They often lack interpretability, obscuring how clusters are formed, and fail to fully leverage the complementary information across views, limiting clustering quality. Additionally, large-scale data introduces high computational demands, with traditional methods requiring extensive post-processing and manual tuning.To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-view clustering approach based on probability transition matrices. By selecting anchor points and constructing bipartite similarity graphs, we can capture the relationships between data points and anchors in different views and reduce computational complexity. Through probability matrices, we efficiently transfer cluster labels from anchors to samples, generating membership matrices without the need for post-processing. We further assemble these membership matrices into a tensor and apply a Schatten \\(p\\)-norm constraint to exploit complementary information across views, ensuring consistency and robustness. To prevent trivial solutions and ensure well-defined clusters, we incorporate nuclear norm-based regularization. Extensive experiments on various datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

Within this model, to reduce the computational complexity, the relationships between data points and the selected anchors in different views are captured, and recorded by the bipartite similarity graphs. Based on these probability graphs,  the cluster labels from anchors to samples are transferred, and the membership matrices can be obtained without the need for post-processing. To further exploit complementary information across views, the membership matrices are stacked into a tensor and contrained by a Schatten p-norm."

However, these ideas are not new in the field of multi-view clustering, and the combination of anchor selection, tensor structure and probability matrix has been applied in some methods[1][2].\n[1] Nie, Feiping, et al. \"Fast clustering with anchor guidance.\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2023).\n[2] Yu, Weizhong, et al. \"Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering Based on Anchor Graph.\" IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (2023).\n\n2. This paper lacks ablation experiments on the key design of using probability matrix to calculate membership matrix. Given that this method is a core contribution of FTMVC-APTM, conducting relevant ablation experiments will help evaluate the actual impact of this strategy on the model performance.\n\n3. Although this paper demonstrates the superior performance of FTMVC-APTM on multi-view datasets, the scale of these datasets is relatively limited (the number of samples ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand), which fails to fully verify the performance of the method on large-scale data. It is recommended to supplement the experiments on larger datasets, such as the YTF dataset and the Caltech dataset.\n\n4. It is recommended that the authors appropriately increase the visualization results of clustering to help readers more intuitively understand the performance and clustering structure of the proposed FTMVC-APTM method."
