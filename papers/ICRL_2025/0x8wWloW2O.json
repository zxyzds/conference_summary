    "title": "OracleMamba: A Dynamic Market-Guided and Time State Selection Framework for Robust Stock Prediction",
    "abstract": "Stock price prediction is a complex challenge due to the inherent volatility of financial markets and the influence of diverse factors such as macroeconomic conditions, capital flows, and market sentiment. Recent joint stock forecasting models focus on extracting temporal patterns from individual stock price series and combining them to model stock correlations. However, these models face two critical limitations: first, in long-term predictions, they retain both informative and excessive states, amplifying noise and increasing complexity; second, in short-term predictions, they prioritize market indices and technical indicators, neglecting the real-time influence of market sentiment, which can drive price movements independent of traditional indicators. While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba improve efficiency and capture long-distance relationships, they still underperform compared to Transformer-based models.\nTo address these challenges, we propose OracleMamba, a novel framework that integrates a dynamic market-guided module for short-term forecasting and a SelectiveMamba module for long-term forecasting. The dynamic market-guided module fuses objective market data and subjective sentiment analysis to enhance short-term prediction accuracy. The SelectiveMamba module efficiently captures both spectral and temporal features using a 3D scan mechanism, which extracts and filters key signals from the time-series data. By integrating spectral features to identify market rhythms and temporal features to track price movements over time, the SelectiveMamba module reduces noise and preserves critical information for long-term forecasts. This framework significantly improves both model efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing approaches across real-world stock prediction tasks.",

                "value": "The paper presents OracleMamba, a new stock prediction framework designed to integrate both short-term and long-term market dynamics using a dynamic market-guided module and a SelectiveMamba module. The model aims to address the limitations of previous joint forecasting models by effectively balancing short-term market volatility and long-term trends. OracleMamba uses a comprehensive market-guided gating mechanism that fuses market sentiment and objective market indicators to enhance prediction accuracy, while the SelectiveMamba module captures spectral and temporal features to reduce noise and extract key signals from market data."

It is also unclear how much these features specifically contribute to OracleMamba's performance. If baseline models do not incorporate the same information, the comparison may be unfair.\n2. The exact data point length in CSI300 and CSI800 for model training is not specified. Is the data daily-based or hourly-based? Given that Mamba-based methods are used, a longer financial data sequence might provide an advantage.\n3. Since the paper adopts a Mamba-based solution, it is crucial to evaluate the computational cost, including memory usage and runtime efficiency."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The market state encoding section lacks sufficient details to justify the use of market state information:\n1. The authors failed to describe the subjective context thoroughly. There is only a vague mention of analysts' reports and financial documents scraped from unspecified platforms. It is unclear what these documents are, their market coverage, their frequency, and the volume of data involved. This information is crucial. For example, if only quarterly updated earnings reports from some public companies are used, how do they align with daily updated stock prices? Additionally, how noisy is this data? The current version of the paper is problematic and does not justify the use of market context.\n2. It is unclear how the GPT-O1 model is used to convert these textual data into sentiment. The prompts used are not described. The authors did not specify what the sentiment results look like. Are they presented as sentiment scores, sentiment labels, etc.?\n3. The authors should more clearly specify the role of the experts. Do they mean that the experts are the ones who wrote the documents, or are they directly involved in the analysis?\n4. It is unclear how sectors and regions are processed and embedded in the data or how they are used. The authors seem to only mention these aspects without integrating them into their analysis.\n\nThe TSSS structure has several issues:\n1. Why are B and C input-independent? This is more like a basic SSM structure that is time-invariant, while Mamba is designed to be an improvement on such structures.\n2. What is $s$ in the calculation of DSE?\n3. The design of DTE and DSE lacks explanation, and it is unclear how they reflect the benefits claimed by the authors in the relevant section.\n\nExperiment Section:\n1. The setup for the comparison methods is unclear. Are these methods using the same data as the proposed model, or are they only using stock price data?\n2. Many SOTA time series forecasting models are not included in the comparison, such as DLinear, NLinear, Autoformer, Fedformer, PatchTST, etc.\n3. Why was the vanilla Transformer model used for comparison when there are many Transformer-based models specifically designed for time series tasks?\n4. Comparisons between the proposed model and Mamba-based models (or Mamba itself) are needed."

The article lacks novelty and sufficient discussion on related work:\n\n   a) While using GPT to process market sentiment is indeed innovative, there have been many previous works that utilized text data, including the use of pre-trained language models as in [1].\n\n   b) It is difficult to see the relationship between the Time-Spectral method in the article and stock data. It appears to merely apply a time series method to stock data without analyzing how the Time-Spectral method aids stock prediction or offers any special improvements for it. Additionally, frequency methods are also common in time series analysis, as in [2].\n\n   c) Inter-stock correlations have been used in many previous articles, as in [3].\n\n2. The article claims that the model can handle noisy data, but I do not see how or why noisy data can be addressed, or what improvements have been made compared to previous methods. Why could previous deep learning methods not handle noisy data while the current one can? Furthermore, noise in stock data is often caused by random Brownian motion, which the article does not analyze or explain theoretically.\n\n3. The article mentions the application of the Mamba model, but the method section does not clearly indicate where it is used for those unfamiliar with the Mamba model. Nor does it explain how the Mamba model contributes to stock prediction.\n\n4. The baselines are relatively weak, with only two methods specifically tailored for stock data.\n\n5. The article does not provide the code.\n\n\n[1] Yang, Linyi, et al. \"Numhtml: Numeric-oriented hierarchical transformer model for multi-task financial forecasting.\"\u00a0Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
