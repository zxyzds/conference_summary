    "title": "NPF-$k$CT: A $k$-center clustering solver with neural process filter for continuous POMDP-based object search",
    "abstract": "Efficiently searching for target objects in intricate environments poses a significant challenge for mobile robots, given factors like perception errors, limited field of view (FOV), and visual occlusion. To alleviate this difficulty, we formulate the object-search task as a high-dimensional Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with hybrid (continuous and discrete) action spaces in a 3D region. We propose a novel sampling-based online POMDP solver named Neural Process Filtered $k$-Center Clustering Tree (NPF-$k$CT). The optimal action is selected using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in conjunction with a neural process network to filter out ineffective primitive actions (i.e., basic robot operations), alongside $k$-center clustering hypersphere discretization to efficiently refine high-dimensional continuous sub-action spaces. Adhering to the hierarchical optimistic optimization (HOO) concept, we leverage an upper-confidence bound (UCB) on the action value function within the hypersphere with estimated diameters to guide the MCTS expansion. We thoroughly tested our approach in Gazebo simulations across a range of target-finding scenarios using two robot simulators: Fetch and Stretch.  A comparative analysis with baseline methods  shows our approach achieves a higher success rate and faster target detection without increasing computational demands. We also validated our method on a real robot in an office environment. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/npfkct.",

                "value": "This paper proposes an online POMDP solver, Neural Process Filtered k-Center Clustering Tree (NPF-kCT),  designed to optimize object search tasks for mobile robots in cluttered environments. NPF-kCT integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a neural process network and a k-center clustering approach, making action selection more efficient by filtering out sub-optimal actions from high dimensional action spaces.  Experiments in Gazebo and real-world settings show the solver's effectiveness, as it outperforms baseline POMDP methods in success rate, speed, and total reward for the same computation budget."

                "value": "1. One of the primary drawbacks of tree search based algorithms is increasing sample/time complexity with larger tree widths. In this paper, NPF-kCT effectively combines neural process filtering with k-center clustering and MCTS to filter out sub-optimal actions while expanding the search tree. \n\n2. Results include both simulated and real-world scenarios of object search in cluttered environments and the proposed method can generalize to different robot platforms. NPF-kCT especially outperforms comparable MCTS-based baseline algorithms in terms of number of actions or steps required to achieve the task."

Some of these are setting the number of clusters $k$, number of simulation episodes in the search tree, and neural process network training which affects the filtered action space.  \n\n2. Certain assumptions, such as a 100% success rate for actions in Gazebo, may not fully reflect real-world constraints, possibly affecting the method\u2019s performance in practical applications.\n\n3. In terms of writing quality, although the authors have provided adequate details for the algorithm, it might help to make the text more succinct to further improve the presentation."

Line 246 - why does it start from the middle of a sentence? \n\n3. Why was the time complexity not reported for any of the algorithms in Table 1? Is it efficient enough to actually use NPF-kCT as an online solver with real robots?"

The paper outlines that the major challenges are searching for target objects in cluttered and partially known environments, where perception errors, limited fields of view, and visual occlusions are prevalent. NPF-kCT formulates the object search problem as a high-dimensional POMDP with hybrid action spaces and utilizes a neural process-based network to predict the feasibility of primitive actions and filter out ineffective ones. The method also applies a clustering method to group filtered actions into hyperspheres and employs MCTS in conjunction with a UCB strategy to construct a belief tree and select optimal actions. The paper provides theoretical results for sampling robot actions and empirical results in Gazebo simulations with Fetch and Stretch robot simulators that outperform baseline methods in terms of success rate and efficiency in finding target objects."

It would be interesting to see how this method scales with higher-dimensional belief states and action spaces. Line 246 does not seem to be a full sentence. The clarity for the Motivation about Network Filtering is still not obvious and would benefit from being clearer. The related works would also benefit from being more thorough.

The overall methodology might be novel but considering the individual modules, it comes down to a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), an action scoring network (NPF) and k-center clustering. This approach seems heavily engineered towards solving the Object Search problem specifically and holds little appeal for the broader learning community.\n\n2. Missing SOTA and comparitive study : The paper has not cited or evaluated against some known methods in the domain of Object search such as [1]. This makes it difficult to understand not just the comparative efficacy of the proposed method but also the complexity of the experimental setup.\n\n3. The paper primarily uses the scenarios created by the authors through Gazebo for evaluation. However it would be better and more helpful to add experiments on some known dataset or benchmarks such as ScanNet [2].\n\n4. The experimental setup seems too simple. In 4 out of the 5 scenarios the paper shows results in Table 1, the baselines and this method achieve well over 90% successful rate of object search within 50 steps. This warrants the need for more thorough evaluation either by increasing the complexity of the simulated setting or testing on some known dataset/benchmark as previously stated.\n\n[1] Francesco Giuliari, Geri Skenderi, Marco Cristani, Alessio Del Bue, and Yiming Wang. 2023.

Specifically, [2] proposes a memory model to remember and retrieve the occluded target objects by selecting action primitives to achieve the goal. I understand that both [1] and [2] only present experiments with a fixed-base arm, but it should be feasible to extend their approaches to mobile manipulation by incorporating navigation skills. \n\n[1]: C.
