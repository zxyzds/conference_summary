    "title": "Reconstructing Training Data From Real-World Models Trained with Transfer Learning",
    "abstract": "Current methods for reconstructing the training data from trained classifiers are restricted to very small models, limited training set sizes, and low-resolution images. Such restrictions hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach enabling data reconstruction in realistic settings for models trained on high-resolution images. Our method adapts the reconstruction scheme of Haim et al. [2022] to real-world scenarios -- specifically, targeting models trained via transfer learning over image embeddings of large pre-trained models like DINO-ViT and CLIP. Our work employs data reconstruction in the embedding space rather than in the image space, showcasing its applicability beyond visual data. Moreover, we introduce a novel clustering-based method to identify good reconstructions from thousands of candidates. This significantly improves on previous works that relied on knowledge of the training set to identify good reconstructed images. Our findings shed light on a potential privacy risk for data leakage from models trained using transfer learning methods.",

                "value": "This paper explores optimization-based **data inversion** techniques from pre-trained models with transfer learning, in which we could reconstruct the training data simply given the pre-trained encoder and classifier itself. It extends the model-inversion techniques with improved designs like loss, generative decoder. The clustering-based approach further demonstrates the possibility of high-quality reconstructions to the original data. Experiments on two common datasets reveals the potential privacy risks associated with models trained on sensitive data."

It is more close to averaged per-category data when training data is not available, the author might want to turn down their scope.\n- Another thinking is that the current method may only work with classifiers-based model, for more more fine-grained training data reconstruction from segmentation model like SAM might be more desired. Also the reconstruction quality varies significantly with the choice of backbone model (DINO, CLIP, etc.), which affects the novelty of the clustering approach by making it model-dependent.\n- As the author also mentioned, the inversion process used to map embeddings back to images is computationally expensive, which could hinder scalability"

This paper claims to be suitable for the reconstruction of high-resolution images, while the experiments are only conducted on the datasets with low resolution like 224 (why 224x224 fits that definition of \"high resolution\" in this paper?).
