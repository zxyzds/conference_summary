    "title": "InversionGNN: A Dual Path Network for Multi-Property Molecular Optimization",
    "abstract": "Exploring chemical space to find novel molecules that simultaneously satisfy multiple properties is crucial in drug discovery. However, existing methods often struggle with trading off multiple properties due to the conflicting or correlated nature of chemical properties.  To tackle this issue, we introduce InversionGNN framework, an effective yet sample-efficient dual-path graph neural network (GNN) for multi-objective drug discovery.  In the direct prediction path of InversionGNN, we train the model for multi-property prediction to acquire knowledge of the optimal combination of functional groups.\nThen the learned chemical knowledge helps the inversion generation path to generate molecules with required properties. \nIn order to decode the complex knowledge of multiple properties in the inversion path, we propose a gradient-based pareto search method to balance conflicting properties and generate Pareto optimal molecules. \nAdditionally, InversionGNN is able to search the full Pareto front approximately in discrete chemical space. Comprehensive experimental evaluations show that InversionGNN is both effective and sample-efficient in various real-world discrete multi-objective settings including drug discovery.",

                "value": "- My main concern is the claimed superiority of InversionGNN in molecular design results. On close examination of Table 1, it appears that DST, the most competitive baseline, performs nearly on par with InversionGNN across various metrics. Since the primary enhancement in InversionGNN is the gradient-based Pareto inversion module, this raises the question of whether the impact of this module is limited and whether the tokenization approach of the scaffolding tree is actually more critical for molecular design.\n\n- The time complexity analysis is insufficient. In practical applications, QP-solving complexity can be significant. While the paper suggests that computing the non-dominating gradient is negligible in theory, I recommend adding a comparison of computation times across methods to provide clearer insights.\n\n- The motivation behind oracle budget selection is not well-explained. What was the rationale for the oracle call budgets chosen for each baseline? The authors should consider controlling for a consistent budget across models to ensure fair supervision signals, which would also facilitate comparative analysis.\n\n- The definition of the neighborhood set is somewhat ambiguous. How is the neighborhood set specifically defined in the context of molecular design?"

It consists of a Direct Prediction Path, where a GNN is trained to predict multiple chemical properties, leveraging learned chemical knowledge to enhance understanding of optimal functional group combinations and an Inversion Generation Path that employs a gradient-based Pareto optimization method to generate molecules that meet specified properties, addressing challenges posed by conflicting or correlated objectives. Key contributions include the integration of property prediction knowledge into molecular optimization processes and a novel relaxation technique that adapts gradient-based Pareto optimization for discrete chemical spaces, facilitating the exploration of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Empirical evaluations show that InversionGNN is both effective and sample-efficient, outperforming existing methods in multi-objective drug discovery scenarios by successfully balancing trade-offs among various chemical properties."

                "value": "\u2460The assumptions underlying Theorem 4.2 are not clearly articulated or justified within the text. Possible assumptions that could be relevant include the continuity and differentiability of the objective functions, the boundedness of molecular sizes, and the stability of the optimization process under varying conditions. The absence of a discussion on these assumptions raises concerns about the robustness of the theoretical claims presented. Without a thorough examination, it becomes challenging to assess the practical applicability of the results in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the theoretical framework predominantly focuses on the specific architecture and objectives of InversionGNN. This narrow focus limits the generalizability of the findings, as it does not consider how the proposed method may perform under different conditions or with various types of optimization problems. Expanding the theoretical discussion to include a broader range of contexts could enhance the credibility and utility of the results.\n\n\u2461The majority of experiments in this paper compare InversionGNN only with I-LS, which is a very simplistic linear scalarization model. Demonstrating that InversionGNN outperforms I-LS does not provide significant insights into its effectiveness or practical advantages. Additionally, many experiments only contrast InversionGNN with older methods, while comparisons with more recent advancements, such as HN-GFN, are limited to just two lightweight experiments. The primary experiments lack comprehensive comparisons with contemporary approaches, which could better contextualize the performance of InversionGNN and underscore its contributions to the field.\n\n\u2462The paper lacks thorough experimental evaluations against SOTA methods in multi-objective optimization. A detailed comparative analysis with current leading techniques would provide a clearer understanding of InversionGNN's strengths and weaknesses. By not including such comparisons, the paper misses an opportunity to establish a more compelling case for the novelty and superiority of InversionGNN in the context of existing literature. Including SOTA comparisons could significantly enhance the paper's contributions and relevance to researchers in the field."

Please clarify the role and purpose of the \"dual-path\" structure.\n- Differentiation from Vanilla GCN: The distinction between the \"Direct Prediction Path\" and a standard Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is unclear. Section 4.2 could be revised to explicitly highlight how this path diverges from a traditional GCN and its specific contributions to the model.\n- Role of Relaxation Techniques: It is not clear how the relaxation techniques, which reformulate the discrete molecule Pareto optimization problem into a locally differentiable one, aid in capturing trade-offs among conflicting or correlated properties. Additional explanation on how this helps to balance multiple properties would improve understanding.\n\nWhile this paper shows promise, I am not an expert in multi-objective optimization, and some core concepts remain unclear to me.
