    "title": "Composing Unbalanced Flows for Flexible Docking and Relaxation",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a successful approach for molecular docking, but they often cannot model protein flexibility or generate nonphysical poses. We argue that both these challenges can be tackled by framing the problem as a transport between distributions. Still, existing paradigms lack the flexibility to define effective maps between such complex distributions. To address this limitation we propose Unbalanced Flow Matching, a generalization of Flow Matching (FM) that allows trading off sample efficiency with approximation accuracy and enables more accurate transport. Empirically, we apply Unbalanced FM on flexible docking and structure relaxation, demonstrating our ability to model protein flexibility and generate energetically favorable poses. On the PDBBind docking benchmark, our method FlexDock improves the docking performance while increasing the proportion of energetically favorable poses from 30% to 73%.",

                "value": "The paper presents a new approach named Flexdock for flexible molecular docking and structure relaxation.  The model is based on Unbalanced Flow Matching (UFM), which relaxes the marginal constraints of FM through a more careful chosen coupling distribution and reduces the modeling complexity. This framework aims to address limitations in existing molecular docking techniques, particularly concerning protein flexibility and the generation of nonphysical molecular poses. From the experimental results on PDBBind benchmark, the proposed method well achieved this goal, especially in generating energetically favorable poses."

What insights do the authors have regarding previous ML-based approaches performing poorly on the PB-Valid metric? Based on the experimental results from diffdock-pocket (rigid), rigid docking methods still generate non-physical structures. Which component predominantly drives the PB-Valid metric in your experiments - intramolecular or intermolecular validity?\n4. Compared to PB-Valid metrics, FLEXDOCK demonstrates no significant improvement in RMSD-related metrics. While RMSD remains a crucial indicator for evaluating approximate poses, one must question the necessity of pursuing validity and physicality when RMSD values are still low and approximate pose estimation lacks precision."

In the motivation for the unbalanced flow matching authors say that due to the limited availability of the data points from $q_1$ (i.e. holo structures), the expected length of the flow will be large and the expected OT cost between $q_0$ and $q_1$ will be high. In my opinion, that would be true if there was a certain level of diversity in samples from $q_0$ (i.e. different apo structures) that correspond to a single (available) sample from $q_1$. But is it really the case for protein structures? I have a feeling that the diversity in apo structures of the same protein is not that high. I believe that the proposed method indeed improves learning the transport, as demonstrated in Figure 4. But I think it would be very beneficial to dissect this experiment and look at the flow distances and transport costs for different cutoffs, or even just plot these distributions for your training data. In my opinion, such a deeper analysis will strengthen the motivation a lot.\n\n2. Authors suggest to use the coupling of the form $q(x0,x1) = q_0(x_0)q_1(x_1)\\mathbb{I}_{c(x_0, x_1)<cdock}$. \n* 2.1 Does it mean that some examples where conformation change upon binding is significant are completely discarded from the training?\n* 2.2 If 2.1 is true, how does the model perform on similar examples (i.e. the ones that change a lot upon binding) from the test set?\n* 2.3 Can it be true that \"All-Atom RMSD% < 1A = 41.7%\" means that around 40% of the test set are proteins that almost don't change upon binding, and the model (trained on couplings with rather strict $c_{dock}$) just doesn't change these structures meaning that it \"recovers\" holo conformations for these 40% correctly?\n\n\n**Minor comments:**\n1. Lines 40-45: could you please provide the references to the works you\u2019re discussing here?\n2. Are the protein states over the trajectory physically-realistic?\n3. Could you please provide a more detailed description of y-axis in Figure 4 (include \"% of passed predictions\" or something like this)?\n4. Line 273 - 274 -> I could not find the introduction of the coupling $q(x0, x1) = q(x0)q(x1)\\mathbb{I}$ in the previous section. What are you referring to?\n5. Line 182 \u2013 I am not sure if it is a typo or maybe I am wrong, but to me it looks like (3) is the lower bound of (2)."

It would be helpful to provide the distribution of RMSD on $C_{\\alpha}$ positions between apo and holo structures in the training and test data.\n3. What is $q_0$ for ligands and how does the Unbalanced FM framework combine with the diffusion model for ligands?\n4. What is the actual sampling efficiency of the final model? I.e. how many samples are required on average until the one exceeding the confidence threshold is obtained? Does the Runtime in Table 1 account for it? It would be interesting to look at the dependency of ESS on the selected $c_{dock}$ cutoff.\n5. It has been recently shown that the conventional train/test splits of PDBbind (that authors use in this work), have a significant data leakage [1]. Is it possible that majority of 41% successful predictions (in Table 1) overlap with the training data?\n\n[1] Corso G. et al.

Since it is sampled from the MD trajectories and, in principle, it should provide more accurate structures than the addition of small Gaussian noise on apo structure.\n- The unbalanced pattern is pinned across the training. However, is there a potential risk that, for example, there are some apo structures all have RMSD exceeding 4\u00c5 from the holo structures? Under such situation, they are all been filtered out and the sampling would fail. Should the traditional flow and unbalanced flow been given a ratio during the training process (like 5/5)?\n- The comparison between AF3 on PB is preferred (extended Data Fig.4)."
