    "title": "ATM: Improving Model Merging by Alternating Tuning and Merging",
    "abstract": "Model merging has recently emerged as a cost-efficient paradigm for Multi-task Learning (MTL). Among merging solutions, Task Arithmetic \\citep{task-vectors} stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, we start by motivating the effectiveness of task vectors with their relation to multi-task gradients. We show that in the single epoch scenario, task vectors are exactly equivalent to \n gradients obtained by performing gradient descent in a multi-task setting, and still approximate the latter with further epochs. We further strengthen the explanation by showing that task vectors work best when equality is maintained and motivate their effectiveness in the general case by showing that most of the contribution in the total update is determined by the gradient of the first epoch. Guided by this parallel, we propose viewing model merging as a single step in an iterative process that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). Acting as a midpoint between model merging and multi-task gradient descent, ATM obtains state-of-the-art results with the same data and computing requirements. We first extensively evaluate our approach under diverse settings, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, leading by an accuracy of up to 19\\% in computer vision and 20\\% in NLP over the best baselines. We then motivate its effectiveness empirically, showing increased orthogonality between task vectors and, theoretically, proving it to minimize an upper bound to the loss obtained by finetuning jointly on all tasks.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel model \u201cmerging\u201d algorithm, where the goal is to merge separately tuned, task-specific models into a joint multi-task model. The paper begins by making several observations regarding the paradigm of task-specific fine-tuning followed by model merging. First, they demonstrate the relationship between fine-tuning then model merging and standard multi-task learning (i.e. following the average task gradient at each step). Additionally, they show that merging the model after a single epoch results in stronger generalization than merging after the task-specific models converge on their respective tasks, and present some empirical analysis to help explain this finding.\n\nMotivated by these findings, the authors propose Alternating Tuning and Merging (ATM), wherein training alternates between making task-specific updates to task-specific models and making a \u201cglobal\u201d update by merging the task-specific models together. The authors demonstrate that ATM significantly outperforms other model merging baselines, which all consist of a single merge step. Additionally, the authors provide analysis of performance regarding the frequency at which models are merged vs. tuned under an epoch budget, showing that merging more frequently improves performance."

                "value": "My understanding is that model merging is primarily a technique for taking advantage of models which are fine-tuned separately from one another, e.g. combining separate open-source models trained by different individuals. In other words, model merging is a technique to construct multi-task models when multi-task data is not available, i.e. when a single joint model cannot be trained. The proposed method, however, assumes that we have access to the entire multi-task data at one time, in order to alternate between tuning and merging.\n\nIn this case, it is not clear to me why we would not simply do multi-task learning, and indeed this paper seems to suggest that we should be doing precisely that: performance goes up as we merge more often during training, and as we merge more often during training we more closely approximate multi-task learning. However, pure MTL (i.e. no task-specific updates) is not considered here as a baseline. Thus, it is not clear to me how this new method (ATM) fits into the current paradigm of model merging or transfer learning, outside of an analysis on the impact of the rate at which models are merged versus tuned.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the proposed method is similar to heterogeneous federated averaging, where learning algorithms often alternate between making local \u201ctask-specific\u201d updates to task-specific models and making global \u201cmulti-task\u201d updates using changes to the task-specific models. In this literature, it has been established that \u201cglobal SGD\u201d, which makes no local updates, has better convergence guarantees but that \u201clocal SGD\u201d which makes some task-specific updates before merging can have some generalization benefits [1,2]. I feel strongly that this literature needs to be acknowledged and discussed in this paper, given their similarities.\n\nA smaller comment: in line 420 it is claimed that the hyperparameters are untuned in the data-free setting, and then later mentioned that the author-suggested hyperparameters are used. I am not sure that both can be true however, as it is likely the case that the previous authors used the validation data for tuning the hyperparameters, and therefore that the hyperparameters actually have seen the data being used for training in this case.\n\nThe floating figures need to be fixed, there are 3 pages where the figure hangs off the bottom edge of the page and messes up the formatting of the next page as well.\n\n[1] Woodworth et al., 2022; Minibatch vs Local SGD for Heterogeneous Distributed Learning\n[2] Bao et al., 2024; Provable Benefits of Local Steps in Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Neural Networks: A Feature Learning Perspective"

Specifically:\n\n\n1. The method is wrongly presented as model merging, while it is more closely related to joint fine-tuning. Imo, it cannot be seen as model merging, since the task combination is known a priori. The method is inflexible and defeats the purpose of model merging\n2. Moreover, there is not a single reference for multi-task learning, nor is it considered as a baseline. The method mostly resembles gradient-based MTL solutions [1-3, inter alia], where instead of gradients being computed at every step, task vectors are computed and merged after some steps. This can actually be implied by lines 88-91. The paper would benefit from looking into this perspective by first motivating the need of gradient-balancing solutions (vs loss-balancing [4])in the fine-tuning paradigm (which might actually not be the case) and then formulating the method as a way to combat the memory issues associated with gradient-balancing\n3. Task vectors vs gradients: this is an obvious connections. For one step of (S)GD, the definitions are the same.\n4. Lack of proper citations: no mention of multi-task literature as well as other places. For instance: \u201cunder this unifying lens, reducing task interference is analogous to reducing conflicting gradients in multi-task learning\u201d misses [5,6] for interference and [3] for conflicting gradients.\n5. Section 6 is poorly structured, starting with ablation studies culminating into the main results deep into the section\n6. Lack of scientific rigor: \u201cIn all setting, we adopt mean aggregation of task vectors and use a scaling factor of 1 when applying them to the base model\u201d. This shows that the baselines are misconfigured, making the comparison unfair.\n7. Overstating the results: Given the lack of proper baseline selection and correct setup of used baselines, the stated improvements of \u201cup to 19% in computer vision and 20% in NLP over the best baselines\u201d are far-fetched. \n8. \u201cgreatest contribution is given by the first epoch\u201d: this is presented as a novel insight but it is not. This occurs naturally during training since the model adapts to the new distribution and, the same applies to Fine-tuning\n9. Increased orthogonality: the comparison is unfair, since the authors choose to compare the task vectors of the last iteration with the \u201cgeneral\u201d ones form standard fine-tuning. They will be more orthogonal since the joint features are already embedded in the multi-task vector via the proposed joint fine-tuning and the last fine-tuning only focuses on task-specific features. \n\nGiven the above, I disagree with all four of the stated contributions of this work.\n\n[1] Navon A, Shamsian A, Achituve I, Maron H, Kawaguchi K, Chechik G, Fetaya E.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Misalignment with Model Merging Goals**. The paper appears to overlook the key aims of model merging. The motivation for merging models fine-tuned on different tasks is not only saving memory \u2013 as the introduction of the paper claims \u2013 but instead bypassing expensive joint fine-tuning by enabling the combination of models fine-tuned *independently* on separate tasks. Indeed, model merging methods often rely on available checkpoints from online hubs. Contrary to this goal, ATM\u2019s merging process mixes models already at the fine-tuning stage. This loses all the modularity properties and undermines the very benefits of model merging. Consequently, the baseline most relevant for this study is standard multi-task learning, i.e., joint fine-tuning, which is missing (and expected to obtain superior performance over ATM). Table 2 comparing computational costs is therefore misleading since ATM requires joint fine-tuning. For example, adding one task with Task Arithmetic or TIES is straightforward. Adding one task with ATM requires full retraining of the model on all tasks.\n\n2. **Baseline Comparison and Parameter Choices**. The baselines used in the experiments rely on suboptimal hyperparameters (see, e.g., line 350 \"in all settings, we adopt mean aggregation of task vectors and use a scaling factor of 1 when applying them to the base model\"). This decision severely weakens the validity of all results of the paper and prevents a fair comparison with past approaches. Moreover, the paper cites but omits evaluation against state-of-the-art merging methods such as AdaMerging, which, despite its significant computational overhead, is far less resource-intensive than ATM.\n\n3. **Experimental Scope**. The experiments are limited to small and/or outdated models. For instance, in the case of computer vision, only the ViT B16 model is used. Standard benchmark architectures such as ViT large, T5, or LLaMA models are not included. Arguably, this is due to the excessive computational overhead of ATM compared to present methods, which hinders the scalability of ATM, further reinforcing the concerns above.\n\n4. **Presentation of Results**. The paper opts for qualitative radar charts over numerical tables, complicating performance comparisons. Single-task accuracies after standard fine-tuning are never reported for the baselines, normalized accuracies are also missing. Together with the use of suboptimal hyperparameters and a choice of datasets that are not the standard in the field, this makes it difficult to compare the results against previous work. \n\n5. **Theoretical Analysis and Testing**. The theoretical analysis lacks soundness. Firstly, the fact that task vectors are precisely equal to single-task gradient updates just for the first step of gradient descent does not imply that the best merging performance is obtained when merging after the first step. In fact, the accuracy of the model also improves in the next steps, so even if errors accumulate, this does not exclude the improvement of performance after merging. Secondly, the paper does not test this hypothesis directly with gradient descent; instead, it uses stochastic gradient descent, for which the analysis does not hold. On the one hand, the natural approximation is to approximate one step of GD with one step of SGD (with large batch size) in the early phases of training and not with a full epoch consisting of hundreds if not thousands of steps. On the other hand, testing it with gradient descent is straightforward using gradient accumulation.  If done, results would likely show that merging performance post first step is not optimal, as the model would still closely reflect zero-shot capabilities at this stage.\n\n6. **Presentation Quality**. The paper suffers from several presentation issues. Figures are of low quality, extend beyond page margins, and are occasionally truncated. Some captions are missing. Table 2 is presented before Table 1, ignoring the logical flow. Additionally, the paper\u2019s notation is inconsistent, e.g., symbols such as $\\theta_0, \\theta_{base}, \\theta_{init}$ appear to refer to the same quantity."

The requirements for data and training are obligatory for the authors\u2019 method, thus making the application scenarios quite different. The authors should compare their method with others that require similar amounts of data and training (at least with the most standard MTL results). Alternatively, authors could define the approach as a new training paradigm that utilizes merging method, rather than simply as a model merge method.\n2. **Inappropriate Cost Comparison**: For the same reason, the comparison of computational and storage costs in Section 6.6 is also unreasonable. The merging stage of the authors\u2019 method remains Task Arithmetic, but it combines with training to change the timing of merging. Thus, it is unreasonable to only consider the computational and storage costs of the merging stage; training costs are unavoidable."

In Figure 6, the authors illustrate, through the declining curve of baselines like Task Arithmetic, the expert capability increased with the decreased performance of the final merged model. However, could the performance decline of the merged model be due to over-training of individual expert models? It is suggested that the authors report the performance changes of a single expert model across epochs to further support their claim.\n3. Regarding valFT ATM, reaching such astonishing results with only the validation set is noteworthy. Could the authors provide more information on this setting?\n4. In my understanding, Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.1.1 conclude that models obtained by GD then merged and the model obtained by MTL loss (defined as \\bar{L}_t(\\theta) in Theorem 3.1) are somewhat equivalent only for 1 epoch. When exceeding 1 epoch, additional errors are introduced (not sure if I understood correctly?). I strongly suggest the authors report the results of the standard MTL (simultaneously fine-tuning multiple tasks) for further theoretical validation.\n\nTypos:\nFormatting errors in various figures and tables, including Figures 6 and 8 and Table 2.\nThe caption of Figure 3 is missing."
