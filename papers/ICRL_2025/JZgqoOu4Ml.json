    "title": "Diffusion priors for Bayesian 3D reconstruction from incomplete measurements",
    "abstract": "Many inverse problems are ill-posed and need to be complemented by prior information that restricts the class of admissible models. Bayesian approaches encode this information as prior distributions that impose generic properties on the model such as sparsity, non-negativity or smoothness. However, in case of complex structured models such as images, graphs or three-dimensional (3D) objects, generic prior distributions tend to favor models that differ largely from those observed in the real world. Here we explore the use of diffusion models as priors that are combined with experimental data within a Bayesian framework. We use 3D point clouds to represent 3D objects such as household items or biomolecular complexes formed from proteins and nucleic acids. We train diffusion models that generate coarse-grained 3D structures at a medium resolution and integrate these with incomplete and noisy experimental data. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we focus on the reconstruction of biomolecular assemblies from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images, which is an important inverse problem in structural biology. We find that posterior sampling with diffusion model priors allows for 3D reconstruction from very sparse, low-resolution and partial observations.",

(2023) is adopted.  Specifically, 3D structures are reconstructed from 2D projections using point-cloud based representations, adopting the point-cloud 3D diffusion model of Nichol et al. (2022).  The problem of cryo-electron microscopy is considered, demonstrating that the proposed approach allows 3D reconstructions from sparse, low-resolution and partial observations."

The main contributions are in combining these for cryo-EM.\n- For the ShapeNet problem, the benchmark considered (maximum liklihood) does not include any regularizing prior and it is therefore not suprising that performance is poor. It would be more informative to consider a method that includes a typical regularizing prior but that is not a generative model.\n- For the cryo-EM problem, again a maximum likelihood alternative is considered as a benchmark.  There are no comparisons against existing standard methods."

What type of regularizing prior would typically be considered for such problems?  An alternative prior might provide more meaningful results for comparison.\n- For the cryo-EM problem, why is there an additional Truth row in Figure 2 based on a fitted mixture model?

While the formulation of the likelihood term is interesting, current manuscript lacks enough technical details to explain how the likelihood gradient is computed because the likelihood itself is an optimization problem.\n\n3. **Missing Baselines:** The current experiments only include the maximum likelihood-based method as baseline, which is quite classic and cannot represent the current state-of-the-art.

What about other deep learning-based baselines, such as CryoDRGN (Zhong et al. 2020)? Without competitive baselines, it\u2019s hard to assess the quantitative/qualitative results. \n* In lines 75-76, the authors claim that DPS \u201chas not yet been investigated in the context of 3D data.\u201d This statement is much too strong, as extending DPS to 3D data is obvious. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been investigated outside of published results, and just as one published example, Score-based Data Assimilation (Rozet and Louppe 2023) can be seen as an application of DPS to time-dependent 2D (i.e., 3D) data.\n* In line 170, the authors say that \u201cthe guarantee of exactness is not of practical relevance.\u201d Again this statement is too strong, and I don\u2019t see how exactness would not be of practical relevance, especially for a scientific task like 3D cryo-EM.\n* Related to the previous point, calling this a \u201cBayesian\u201d approach feels too strong (\u201cBayesian-motivated\u201d or \u201cBayesian-informed\u201d feels more appropriate). The DPS approximation of the time-dependent likelihood is extremely crude, leading to a posterior that\u2019s very far from the true Bayesian posterior. Furthermore, the authors do not analyze the uncertainty of the estimated posterior beyond giving error bars in Tables 1 and 2. \n\nReferences:\n\nZhong et al. \u201cReconstructing continuous distributions of 3D protein structure from cryo-EM images.\u201d ICLR 2020.\n\nRozet and Louppe. \u201cScore-based Data Assimilation.\u201d NeurIPS 2023."

I particularly appreciate the empirical demonstration that the maximum likelihood solution may not be in the support of the prior, if the prior is multimodal.

                "value": "I subdivide the weaknesses into weaknesses in the experimental evaluation and weaknesses in the exposition. \n\nExperimental weaknesses\n- Figure 1 shows \u201cprominent example reconstructions that demonstrate the superior performance of DPS\u201d (line 418). I would prefer to see randomly-chosen examples so that I can appreciate the average-case performance rather than potentially cherry-picked cases.\n- Line 422 says that the structural models from DPS \u201cshow a lower degree of heterogeneity\u201d than the model from maximum likelihood\u2026where is this claim supported by experiments? The standard deviations reported in Table 1 tend to show higher variance for DPS compared to ML.\n- The cryo-EM experiments in section 4.3 are said to be focused on the sparse-data regime because of interest in studying conformational heterogeneity. On the one hand, I completely agree that conformational heterogeneity is of great interest. On the other hand, it is not clear why the proposed method would be useful for recovering heterogeneous structures, or why we would need to focus on the sparse-supervision setting to study heterogeneity.\n- The cryo-EM experiments are all at relatively low resolution, while the authors acknowledge that recovering high-resolution details is the primary challenge in practice. What is the motivation for studying the medium-resolution setting, and are there any barriers to using your method at higher resolution?\n- A major challenge in cryo-EM reconstruction is the low SNR of the projection images, yet in the experiments here it looks like the images used for sparse supervision are not noisy. I would find it more convincing to use many noisy projections for supervision rather than few noiseless projections, as this would be closer to the experimental setting for cryo-EM.\n\nPresentation weaknesses (roughly in order of appearance in the paper)\n- In the text immediately following eq (1) and eq (2) there is a helpful interpretation of the equation in the Gaussian noise case. However, the text after equation 1 describes equivalence to \u201cstandard least-squares fitting\u201d whereas after equation 2 the equivalence is to \u201cregularized least-squares fitting\u201d\u2026why are these different?\n- Some recent related works should be discussed; these are listed under the questions section below in roughly chronological order. The most recent ones are concurrent work so I do not expect them to have been included in the initial submission, but the older ones are prior work that should be discussed. In particular, the contribution claim that \u201cUsing diffusion priors has previously not been explored to solve the 3D reconstruction problem in cryo-EM\u201d should be made more nuanced in light of these prior works, to distinguish more specifically what is novel in the proposed approach.\n- You might consider merging sections 3.1 and 3.2 into section 2, so that there is a smooth flow between introducing standard diffusion methodology and then the specifics of how you apply it to 3D point cloud reconstruction. In particular, equation 8 in section 3.1 is a generalization of equation 4 in section 2, and equation 9 in section 3.2 is nearly identical to equation 7 in section 2. \n- Table 2 is not referenced in the main text. I would suggest moving it to be inside the new section 2/3 and referencing it there.\n- It would be great to include more line-level annotations in Algorithm 1, i.e. on lines 8, 9, and 10 individually rather than a single combined annotation on line 7.\n- This is a very minor LaTeX bug, but throughout the paper the opening quotes are all backwards.\n- Figure 2 caption says that \u201cthe second row shows all ten point clouds generated with DPS\u201d\u2026this does not seem to match what is actually in the second row of the figure, which would appear to be a single structure for each experiment."

I also have some questions around how this work relates to other recent methods that use diffusion models in cryo-EM. It is understandable to not compare against these methods experimentally given their recency (though that would be great), but a brief discussion of similarities and differences would benefit the paper.\n- Latent Space Diffusion Models of Cryo-EM Structures (https://neurips.cc/virtual/2022/61226), was at NeurIPS 2022. This paper considers a diffusion model in the latent space rather than 3D space, so it\u2019s not directly comparable but might be worth including in the discussion of related work.\n- Illuminating protein space with a programmable generative model (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06728-8), was published in 2023 and bears similarity to the proposed approach (diffusion in 3D).\n- Robust Single-Particle Cryo-EM Denoising and Restoration (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10447135?denied=), was at ICASSP 2024 and appeared on arXiv in January 2024. This paper does diffusion denoising in image/projection space rather than in 3D.\n- Solving Inverse Problems in Protein Space Using Diffusion-Based Priors (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04239), preprint released in June 2024 so this might be considered concurrent, or at least very recent. I think this is the most similar to the proposed approach in that it considers several different protein-related inverse problems, and uses the diffusion model as a plug-n-play prior.\n- DiffModeler (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02479-0), preprint was posted in January 2024 but the published version was just released a week ago."
