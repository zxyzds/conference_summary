    "abstract": "Incorporating user preferences into large language models (LLMs) can enhance the personalization and reliability of model outputs and facilitate the application of LLMs to real-world scenarios. However, leveraging user preferences can be a double-edged sword. Recent studies have found that improper utilization can incur sycophancy, where LLMs prioritize alignment with user preferences over the correctness of their outputs. To address sycophancy in LLMs, we analyze and model the problem through the lens of structured causal models (SCMs). We attribute sycophancy to LLMs' reliance on spurious correlations between user preferences and model outputs in this paper. Based on the proposed SCMs, we develop a novel framework to mitigate sycophancy in LLMs by exploiting a significant causal signature. Specifically, we eliminate the spurious correlations embedded in the intermediate layers of LLMs through head reweighting, and then calibrate the intra-head knowledge along the causal representation direction. Extensive experiments are conducted across diverse language tasks, and the empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors in mitigating sycophancy in LLMs.",

The authors conclude that CAUSM effectively mitigates sycophantic behaviour in LLMs by focusing on the causal structure of sycophantic representations. The framework offers a scalable solution to improve the factual reliability of LLMs while respecting user preferences, which holds promise for enhancing trust in AI outputs in real-world applications."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main concerns focus on the application of the structured causal model (SCM) approach. The authors state that causal relations can be captured via a directed acyclic graph (DAG) learned through regularization. However, in real-world applications, the regularization term is unlikely to reach zero. How can the authors be certain that the learned representations are truly disentangled? The methodology would benefit from a more robust approach to verifying that these representations capture causal rather than correlated information.\n\nMy second question relates to the evaluation of DAG structures in SCMs. Typically, metrics like Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) or False Discovery Rate (FDR) are used to confirm if the learned graph conforms to a DAG structure. This paper, however, claims that the approach is inspired by graph models without providing a specific graph-based evaluation. How can we be sure that the learned representations are genuinely causality-related rather than optimized merely by overfitting through additional parameters? Both theoretical analysis and case studies would strengthen the authors\u2019 claims.\n\nRegarding the representation learning approach, it seems counterintuitive that a fully supervised learning model without any stochastic components could infer causality from data alone. The mutual information-based independence criterion here could indicate correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. Causal inference methods typically rely on stochasticity in at least one part of the model (e.g., a two-tower architecture) to differentiate causality from mere correlation. Without this, there is a risk of learning coincidental patterns rather than true causal relationships.\n\nLastly, a minor issue: without providing a formal proof, I recommend avoiding the use of terms like \"Lemma\" to present conclusions, as this suggests a level of mathematical rigor that is not fully substantiated in the paper."

Instead, it would be more effective to provide additional experimental results that demonstrate that the learned representations truly capture causality, beyond merely improving performance. For instance, could the correlation between the generated text and the learned representation be measured? Does the disentangled representation contribute more meaningfully to sycophancy-related terms or phrases? A more fine-grained case study focused on these aspects would offer stronger evidence for the proposed approach than the current, label-focused explanations.\n\nI would like to increase my score if the author could provide more detailed results."

The motivation for the proposed approach and the intuition of the algorithm design needs to be more clear.  \n-  In the Introduction, the authors discuss two groups of prior research on LLM sycophancy: (1) linear probing and (2) path patching. However, these prior works primarily concentrate on analyzing and understanding sycophantic behavior in LLMs, rather than on mitigating it (also as mentioned in Related Work line 113-122). Given the distinct emphasis of these studies compared to the authors' goal, it is unclear how the limitations of these earlier works directly motivate the development of the authors\u2019 proposed approach.\n\n- While the authors discuss several recent studies on mitigating LLM sycophancy in the Related Work section (lines 124\u2013135), a more in-depth comparison between these studies and their own approach would be beneficial. Specifically, it would be helpful to understand if there are potential methodological concerns with the designs proposed by Burns et al. (2022) and Rimsky et al. (2023) that inspired the development of CAUSM.\n\n- It would be helpful to discuss the rationale for using structured causal models to capture sycophancy in the models\u2019 latent representations.\n\n2. Some compared methods in the tables/figures of results are confusing. E.g., I couldn\u2019t find a clear definition of CAUSM (Base) (Table 1 & 2) and CAUSM (Table 2). What is the difference between CAUSM and CAUSM (Base) in Table 2? \n\n3. Did the authors conduct the experiments on multiple base LLMs or specifically focus on a single base LLM (i.e., Llama-2-7B-Chat)?"

However, I am not convinced how the \u201ccausal direction\u201d in Section 4.3 effectively mitigates these spurious correlations.

I suggest that the authors clarify this aspect in the paper.\n\n2. The second statement in Lemma 4.1 is not described clearly enough. I would like to understand which part of the subsequent methods specifically utilizes this statement. For instance, if we consider a specific example where $f(Z_C,Z_S) = Z_C$, then this condition does not hold in the causal graph shown in Figure 2(a). Furthermore, does the second statement in Lemma 4.1 offer any guidance in constructing the subsequent methods? If not, I would suggest the authors consider removing this statement."
