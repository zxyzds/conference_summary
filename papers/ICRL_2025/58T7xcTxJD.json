    "title": "Dual-level Affinity Induced Embedding-free Multi-view Clustering with Joint-alignment",
    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress, there still exist several limitations in current multi-view clustering (MVC) techniques. Specially, they generally focus only on the affinity relationship between anchors and samples, while overlooking that between anchors. Moreover, due to the lack of data labels, the cluster order is inconsistent across views and accordingly anchors encounter misalignment issue,  which will confuse the graph structure and disorganize cluster representation. Even worse, it typically brings variance during forming embedding, degenerating the stability of clustering results.   In response to these concerns, in the paper we propose a MVC approach named DLA-EF-JA. Concretely, we explicitly exploit the geometric properties between anchors via  self-expression learning skill, and utilize topology learning strategy to feed captured anchor-anchor features into anchor-sample graph  so as to explore the manifold structure hidden within samples  more adequately.  To reduce the misalignment risk, we introduce a permutation mechanism for each view to jointly rearrange anchors according to respective view  characteristics. Besides not involving selecting the baseline view, it also can coordinate with anchors in the unified framework and thereby facilitate the learning of anchors.  Further, rather than forming embedding and then performing spectral  partitioning, based on the criterion that samples and clusters should be hard assignment, we manage to construct the cluster labels directly from original samples using the binary strategy,  not only preserving the data diversity but avoiding variance. Experiments on multiple publicly available datasets confirm the effectiveness of our DLA-EF-JA.",

                "value": "In this work, a multi-view clustering method with joint anchor alignment was developed, which introduces dual-level affinity and achieves embedding-free clustering. The work is designed to address several problems due to the anchor misalignment issues. Therefore, the authors introduce a permutation mechanism for each view to jointly adjust the anchors. Besides, the method is free of learning the embedding by constructing the cluster labels directly from original samples. A self-expression learning structure is utilized on the anchors, which utilizes topology learning strategy to feed captured anchor-anchor features into anchor-sample graph. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Since the work is an anchor alignment based method, more related works with anchor alignment should be compared. For example, the reference Liu 2024 (in line 581) was discussed in this paper, which includes anchor alignment mechanism, but it is not compared with the proposed work.\n3.\tIn Table 1, several compared methods exhibit extremely poor performance on some datasets (e.g., PMSC on Cora, AMGL on DeRMATO). It might be better if the authors could explain the possible reasons.\n4.\tTable 5 does not include all the symbols. The Methodology section might be too brief, which should be introduced with more details by explaining the reasons for the design of each component."

                "value": "This paper presents the DLA-EF-JA model, a multi-view clustering technique that leverages dual-level affinity to capture both anchor-sample and anchor-anchor relationships within data. The model introduces a joint-alignment mechanism to address the anchor misalignment problem across views, which eliminates the need for a baseline view. Unlike traditional embedding methods, DLA-EF-JA generates cluster labels directly, reducing variance and improving clustering stability. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance compared to existing multi-view clustering methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Limited Learning of Cross-View Complementarity:** While the model integrates anchor relations, it lacks complex constraints like the Schatten p-norm that could help capture deeper cross-view complementarities. This may limit the model\u2019s ability to fully leverage unique, complementary information in views with highly distinct features or dimensions. How does the model handle scenarios where the quality of anchors varies significantly across different views?\n\n2. **Necessity of Anchor Alignment:** The reliance on anchor alignment to maintain cross-view consistency introduces additional computational steps. Although this approach appears beneficial, some recent multi-view clustering methods successfully avoid alignment through feature space fusion or shared representations. It would be useful for the authors to elaborate on the essential role of anchor alignment in this model and under what conditions it might be adapted or simplified. Are there specific conditions or datasets where the necessity of anchor alignment might be relaxed or modified?\n\n3. **Complexity of the Model:** The model is somewhat complex, introducing more variables and mathematical processes. A more detailed explanation of the transition from Equation 2 to Equation 3 would enhance reader understanding of the methodology.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Tuning Requirement:** The model\u2019s performance is sensitive to carefully tuned hyperparameters, such as \u03bb and \u03b2. Can the authors provide further insights into the potential effects of anchor noise and how it could be mitigated to improve robustness?"
