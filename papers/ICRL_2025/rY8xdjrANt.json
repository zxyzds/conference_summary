    "title": "OPTIMAL TRANSPORT BARYCENTER VIA NONCONVEX CONCAVE MINIMAX OPTIMIZATION",
    "abstract": "The optimal transport barycenter (a.k.a. Wasserstein barycenter) is a fundamental notion of averaging that extends from the Euclidean space to the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. Computation of the \\emph{unregularized} barycenter for discretized probability distributions on point clouds is a challenging task when the domain dimension $d > 1$. Most practical algorithms for approximating the barycenter problem are based on entropic regularization. In this paper, we introduce a nearly linear time $O(m \\log{m})$ and linear space complexity $O(m)$ primal-dual algorithm, the Wasserstein-Descent $\\dot{\\mathbb{H}}^1$-Ascent (WDHA) algorithm, for computing the exact barycenter when the input probability density functions are discretized on an $m$-point grid. The key success of the WDHA algorithm hinges on alternating between two different yet closely related Wasserstein and Sobolev optimization geometries for the primal barycenter and dual Kantorovich potential subproblems. Under reasonable assumptions, we establish the convergence rate and iteration complexity of WDHA to its stationary point when the step size is appropriately chosen. Superior computational efficacy, scalability, and accuracy over the existing Sinkhorn-type algorithms are demonstrated on high-resolution (e.g., $1024 \\times 1024$ images) 2D synthetic and real data.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors present a new, computationally efficient approach for the Wasserstein barycenter problem. Without resorting to entropic-regularization, which degrades the quality of the result, they propose to formulate the problem as a nonconvex-concave minimax optimization problem, solved with a mixed gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and gradient ascent in Sobolev space. The algorithm is shown to converge to a fixed point with the classic rate for this class of problems. The final complexity is in $O(m \\log m)$ if one projection step is approximated by a double conjugate (which violates the theory but performs well in practice), to be compared with $O(m^3)$ in most previous approaches. Experiments on synthetic data and handwritten digits are performed."

Unless I am mistaken (I could very well miss something), by reformulating the problem as a nonconvex problem, one loses convergence to the true solution, but only towards a stationary point. This is a bit obfuscated in the current formulation, and would deserve a more honest discussion: efficient computation is obtained by \"sacrificing\" some theoretical guarantees, even with good practical performance. (If I missed something and convergence to the true barycenter is guaranteed, then it also deserved to be written!)\n\nMinor typo: \"dicuss\", \"Sythentic\""

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My major concern is related to some discrepancy between the theoretical investigations of the proposed approach and its use in practical tasks. Namely, in Section 3.4, the authors prove several theoretical results regarding their method, including the important Theorem 1, which shows that the proposed algorithm allows finding stationary points of the objective functional. From the proofs in the Appendix, one can see that all theoretical results are logically connected, i.e. Lemma 2 uses the results of Lemma 1, Lemma 3 uses Lemma 2, and so on. Thus, the fulfillment of Theorem 1 also depends on the fulfillment of Lemma 1. At the same time, in Section 3.5 the authors propose to modify the algorithm for practical use in order to reduce the time complexity. This modification consists in replacing the projecting the potentials $\\phi$ on $\\mathbb{F}_{\\alpha, \\beta}$ with computing the second convex conjugate $(\\phi)^{**}$. Such a replacement entails *non-fulfilment* of Lemma 1, as the authors themselves write in lines 422-423. Accordingly, Theorem 1 is also no longer true, i.e. the convergence of the algorithm's solutions to ground-truth solutions is no longer theoretically justified. I will appreciate if the authors could comment on the generalization of Theorem 1 to the case where Lemma 1 is not satisfied or conduct experiments with the original version of the algorithm.\n\nThe practical evaluation also lacks an experiment showing that the proposed algorithm (modified version) actually gives the **ground-truth solutions** for the considered barycenter problem. The authors only perform a comparison of some functional values \u200b\u200bcomputed using a back-and-forth approach (Jacobs and Le \u0301geret, 2020) with the two baseline approaches $-$ WB (Solomon et al, 2015) and DSB (Janati et al., 2020). However, I have doubts regarding this metric for comparison, i.e., the computed functional values. It is not clear from the text how these values \u200b\u200bare calculated - more details about the back-and-forth approach (Jacobs and Le \u0301geret, 2020) should be included. This is especially important since the approaches the authors compare with are entropy-regularized. Besides, I recommend the authors to conduct a comparison with ground truth solutions of the barycenter problem which can be constructed for the case of gaussian measures using, e.g., the iterative algorithm from (\u00c1lvarez-Esteban, Pedro C., et al., 2016), and perform the comparison with the baselines in this setup.\n\nMoreover, I have some doubts regarding the significance of the developed algorithm since it borrows ideas which are already present in the field. $\\dot{\\mathbb{H}}^1$-gradient ascent algorithm for finding the maximizers of dual OT problem was proposed by (Jacobs & Le \u0301ger,2020), while the Wasserstein gradient for solving the barycenter problem was initially proposed in (Zemel & Panaretos, 2019; Chewi et al., 2020). The algorithm in the current work combines these two ideas. \n\n**In summary**, I think that the contribution of the paper is questionable since the algorithm combines the ideas which are already present in the field and, thus, to represent interest for the community it should have some theoretically and practically justified advantages over the previous approaches. However, in the current version of the paper, it is not clear whether the modified algorithm which was used in the experimental part actually learns the ground-truth barycenter after the considered number of epochs or not. The theoretical investigations (convergence analysis) are not valid for this modified algorithm, while the experimental section also lacks the setup with known ground-truth solutions which can be used to mitigate this concern.\n\nMinor:\n - line 132: descent $\\rightarrow$ ascent;\n- mistake in line 269 - there should be $\\max$ instead of $\\min$ over potentials."

Please explain how this Wasserstein gradient is derived?\n\n- Why do you consider only two baseline models, i.e., CWB (Solomon et al, 2015) and DSB (Janati et al., 2020) approaches? These models use the entropy regularization which makes the comparison not entirely fair (yet, I agree that it can be done in the case of small regularization parameter $\\varepsilon$). Meanwhile, you have mentioned many other approaches which compute the barycenter in an unregularized setting, e.g., (Zemel & Panaretos, 2019; Chewi et al., 2020). Why do you not compare with these algorithms? I will highly appreciate it if you perform the comparison with some of these approaches during the rebuttal phase.\n- What do you mean by $\\nabla_1$ in line 211?\n- In lines 315-318 you write: \u201cwe can alternatively use the L2 -gradient to update $\\nu .

This setting is typically encountered in image settings, where one image corresponds to a probability distribution over a grid of pixels. In essence, their method consists in reformulating the Wasserstein barycenter problem as a min-max optimization problem (by relying on the dual formulation of the Kantorovitch transport problem), where the 'max'-based problem is concave while the 'min'-based problem is not convex. Then, they propose to solve this new problem via gradient ascent-descent approach, an iterative algorithm which alternates between a gradient descent step operating on the measure space (with Wasserstein gradient) and gradient ascent steps operating on the space of Kantorovitch dual potentials. Under reasonable assumptions on the input distributions, the authors provide convergence rate to a stationary point and iteration complexity of their algorithm named WDHA. Then, they apply their method to image settings (synthetic data + binarized MNIST) and compare WDHA to previous methods, which rely on regularization."

However, it is hard to take the writing at face value to know the validity of the result. While the reviewer mainly asks for clarification in the remainder of this part, the unclarity of the implementation details in itself is a major weakness.\n\nThe major drawback of this work is that the methodology is not clear from the paper, which is why currently it does not seem possible to assess the quality of this work. Specifically, here are some questions that need to be answered:\n1. How is the differentiation implemented in this work? Terms such as $\\nabla \\phi$ are not continuous and admits discrete proxies. Is it done by finite difference? And, if so, what is the scheme? Or, alternatively, is it done by performing FFT, and is some smoothing filter performed? \n2. How is the pushforward implemented in this work? Assuming $\\nabla \\phi$ is computed, the term $(\\nabla \\phi)_{#}$ might exceed the grid specified. How is this going to be resolved in the numerical example? These are questions that need to be addressed within this work. As of now, the reviewer's understanding is that this work only quotes the Jacobs & Leger paper, but that would be insufficient.\n3. It is quite confusing as to why the authors use a 1024*1024 grid for Sinkhorn in Figure 1. From the plot, it is clear that the distributions $\\mu_1, \\ldots \\mu_4$ occupy a small region of the grid. Is a smaller size used? This should a priori be mentioned in the numerical experiment section. If somehow the full 1024*1024 space is used, then it would be quite unfair to the Sinkhorn algorithm. Alternatively, does the code for WDHA use the sparsity of the source and target distribution?\n4. The comparison between DSB and the proposed method is still inconclusive. It may happen that numerical optimization in addition to a smaller regularization number may lead to better performance in the barycenter functional value and better wall-clock time. The reviewer is not sure if the POT code package result can be taken at face value. \n\nOther major issues:\n- The experiments primarily focus on Algorithm 4, but the analysis is done for Algorithm 3. The authors did not clearly show this intricacy in the contribution subsection. \n- There does not seem to be an implementation for Algorithm 3.\n\nMinor issues:\n- This work does not sufficiently mention the limitation that it is only efficient for low-dimensional grids. Sinkhorn, in contrast, can work by discretization of continuous densities by empirical distributions. The omission to stress this limitation needs to be resolved."
