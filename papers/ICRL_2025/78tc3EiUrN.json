    "title": "MADGEN - Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation",
    "abstract": "The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases.  Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the \"dark chemical space\" without structural annotations.  To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and  evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using  attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.",

                "value": "This study presents MADGEN, a two-stage framework for generating molecular structures from MS/MS data. In the first stage, MADGEN retrieves a scaffold using either predictive retrieval or oracle retrieval. In predictive retrieval, MADGEN treats scaffold selection as a ranking task, using contrastive learning to align embeddings of mass spectra and scaffold candidates in a shared latent space, scoring each scaffold to identify the best match. Oracle retrieval, by contrast, directly uses RDKit to extract the correct scaffold from a molecular graph. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, MADGEN generates the full molecular structure through a Markov bridge-based expansion, sequentially adding atoms and bonds with classifier-free guidance to integrate spectral information. Evaluations were performed on datasets NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym, underscoring its potential in metabolomics and drug discovery applications."

There can be a huge number of scaffold candidates.\n* How does the contrast learning work for aligning the embeddings of mass spectra with their corresponding molecule? Some explanations are needed. \n* Regarding molecular generation in Phase 2, the absorbing transition matrix only applies to isolated atoms, strictly enforcing scaffold structure. Will such a hard constraint be problematic especially when the chosen scaffold is incorrect?\n* Oracle retrieval requires both the MS/MS spectrum and the chemical formula (molecular graphs). If chemical formula is known, what are the remaining challenging in solving the molecular structures?"
