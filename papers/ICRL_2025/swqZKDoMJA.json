    "abstract": "We focus on reducing communication overhead in multiplayer games, where frequently exchanging strategies between players is not feasible and players have noisy or outdated strategies of the other players.\nWe propose \\textit{Decoupled SGDA}, an extension of Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA), where players perform independent updates using outdated strategies of opponents, with periodic strategy synchronization.\nFor Strongly-Convex-Strongly-Concave (SCSC) games, we demonstrate that Decoupled SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to the best-known GDA rates.\nFor \\emph{weakly coupled} games where the interaction between players is lower relative to non-interactive part of the game, Decoupled SGDA significantly reduces communication costs compared to standard SGDA. \nOur findings extend to multi-player games. To provide insights into the effect of communication frequency and convergence, we extensively study the convergence of Decoupled SGDA for quadratic minimax problems. \nLastly, in settings where the noise over the players is imbalanced, Decoupled SGDA significantly outperforms federated minimax methods.",

                "value": "The paper studies minmax optimization, and in particular, consider the case that players only have access to their own (noisy) gradient information, so they need to communicate frequently with other player to get update information. The goal is to design algorithms that take few iterations to converge, and at the same time, minimize the communication cost. \n\nThe paper studies the strongly-convex and strong concave setting (and with some extra smoothness assumptions), and it introduces Decoupled SGDA, an extension of the Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA).\nThe idea is to let players perform independent updates using outdated strategies of opponents (i.e., the lastest communicated strategy), and only perform periodic synchronization. \nThe paper proves that Decoupled SGDA achieves near-optimal communication complexity comparable to standard GDA rates.\nThey introduce the concept of \"weakly coupled games\" - where the interaction between players is relatively minor compared to their individual objectives - and show that in this regime, their method can significantly reduce communication costs. \n\nThe paper also perform experiments on quadratic minmax optimization problem and toy GAN tasks to demonstrate the practical performance of the algorithm."

                "value": "This paper proposes an algorithm called Decoupled SGDA which extends stochastic GDA for the setting where information about players' strategies is noisy or outdated. In this algorithm, players update their strategies 'locally' using outdated strategies from the other players, and then perform a synchronization step to exchange all updated strategies. In strongly-convex-strongly-concave minmax games and in N-player strongly concave games that exhibits the weakly-coupled property, the paper shows that Decoupled SGDA demonstrates communication acceleration (i.e. reduced communication complexity) over baseline methods. Moreover, with a slightly stronger assumption on the coupling degree, Decoupled SGDA can be shown to exhibit communication acceleration over the optimal first order method FOAM in SCSC minmax games. Finally, the paper presents deeper analysis in several other regimes, including in quadratic minmax games with bilinear coupling between players, in a federated learning setup, and with a heuristic modification to the proposed algorithm called the Ghost Sequence. Moreover, the paper presents experiments that corroborate the theoretical results and also show interesting behavior in settings which are not theoretically studied."

Table 1 compares the communication complexity of decoupled SGDA in comparison with existing methods, but it would also be interesting to have a table with the convergence rates to the minmax equilibrium, which would depend on $R,K$.\n- The related work section on Federated Learning feels slightly misplaced given that only the experiments in Sec 5.3 are related to Federated Learning. Would it make sense to move the related work for FL to the appendix and expand more on the gradient descent/minmax optimization specific related work in the main text?\n- The notation for condition numbers $\\kappa_u$, $\\kappa_v$ are used before their definition (e.g. in the related work section, in the paragraph before Corollary 3). Meanwhile they are only defined at the bottom of page 6.\n\n- There are also several typos I've found, listed below:\n    - Line 157: do denote should be 'to' denote\n    - Line 209-210: intiualized should be initialized, and in the definition of (local-SGDA) the $x^u_{t+1}$ in the first summation should be $x^u_{t+i}$.\n    - Line 390: Should this be Decoupled SGDA instead of Decoupled GDA?\n    - Line 402: Decouped-SGDA should be Decoupled SGDA.\n    - Figure 4: The right figure is denoted 'Left', and the reference to 5 links to the experiment section.

Many of the existing results in the literature crucially depend on carefully chosen decreasing stepsize, so having a method which uses constant stepsize might be preferable. But regardless, I am curious how the convergence results change if (for instance) the local updates are performed with a decreasing stepsize.\n- The fact that only the noise on the self-gradients needs to be bounded for the Decoupled SGDA update seems unintuitive to me, can you comment on what the trade-off is? For instance, does this come at a cost of slower convergence rate if the gradients are too noisy, even if it does not affect the communication complexity?"
