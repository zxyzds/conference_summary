    "abstract": "This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities, with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain. We will make our dataset available.",

In the image-captioning constructed from MedTrinity-25M, we found that many basic imaging modalities were incorrectly identified.

In my opinion, the performance of the trained model LLaVA-MedCap is significantly influenced by the quality of the data generated by GPT-4V. However, in Table 3, GPT-4V's performance falls far short of LLaVA-Tri. Why did you choose to use GPT-4V to generate the supervised fine-tuning data for the fine-tuning process? In my recent review of the publicly released MedTrinity-25M data, I found that many of the generated data instances were of average quality, with even simple modalities being incorrect.\n2.\tIn Section 4.1, it is stated that \u201cThe model is fine-tuned for three epochs on each VQA dataset and evaluated accordingly.\u201d However, this evaluation setup is not fair when comparing with the methods presented in the table. Some results in Table 3 appear to be directly extracted from llava-med\u2019s table, but these methods were not fine-tuned on the training set of the VQA benchmark. In contrast, the accuracy of the chosen llava-med method was achieved after fine-tuning for 15 epochs on the corresponding VQA benchmark training set, making this comparison inappropriate.\nCurrently, the evaluation paradigm for multimodal large models (MLLM) typically involves assessing the model directly on multiple benchmarks after two stages of pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. Therefore, I suggested distinguishing the results presented: there should be a comparison of the results not fine-tuned on the corresponding training set against the models that were not fine-tuned. Additionally, when comparing with methods fine-tuned on the corresponding training set, the number of fine-tuning epochs (including for the comparison methods) should be clearly indicated. If possible, please also conduct an ablation study regarding the number of fine-tuning epochs.\n3.\tIn Table 3, comparing CLIP-like models with LLaVA, a multimodal large model, seems inappropriate. It would be better to categorize them into two groups: one for CLIP models and another for MLLM.\n4.\tThe evaluation details in Table 3&4 are not clearly explained.

                "value": "- Limited Applicability for Visual Data without ROIs: The proposed pipeline relies heavily on regions of interest (ROIs) for constructing multimodal data pairs. For visual data that lack explicit ROI annotations, it is unclear how the pipeline can be effectively applied. This limitation may restrict the dataset's usability across the full spectrum of medical images, particularly those where ROI determination is challenging or subjective.\n- Impact of Multigranular Information Not Fully Explored: While Tables 3 and 4 validate the effectiveness of the benchmark in general terms, the paper does not specifically assess how the inclusion of multigranular information, such as ROIs, influences the performance of medical MLLMs. Given that ROI is a pivotal component of the dataset, a focused evaluation comparing models trained with and without multigranular information would strengthen the claims about its benefits.\n- Insufficient Discussion of Related Benchmarks: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of existing med-MLLM benchmarks that involve multigranular information. Notably, works like \"GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI\" and \"A Spectrum Evaluation Benchmark for Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models\" are not cited or compared against. Including a comparative analysis would provide context and clarify how MedTrinity-25M advances the field relative to existing resources.\n- Lack of Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: The dataset is primarily used for training and is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA. These evaluations may not fully capture the effectiveness of the dataset's multigranular annotations since they do not specifically target tasks designed to leverage such detailed information. This omission raises questions about the practical benefits of the multigranular data provided.\n- Challenges with Unique Medical Image Descriptions in RAG: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique used for annotation relies on a general medical knowledge base. However, medical images often have unique features and presentations, even within the same disease category. For example, Atelectasis can manifest differently in chest X-rays depending on the affected lobe. The paper does not address how the RAG system accounts for these unique variations when the initial visual datasets typically offer only generic classification labels. This could impact the accuracy and specificity of the generated annotations."

                "value": "- Handling of Visual Data Without ROIs: For medical images that lack explicit ROI annotations, how does your pipeline construct the corresponding multimodal data pairs? Is there a mechanism to generate or infer ROIs in such cases, or is the pipeline limited to images where ROIs are predefined?\n- Assessing the Impact of Multigranular Information on Med-MLLMs: Considering that ROIs and multigranular annotations are central to your dataset, have you conducted experiments to evaluate how these features specifically affect the performance of medical MLLMs? Can you provide insights or results that demonstrate the advantages of including multigranular information in model training?\n- Comparison with Existing Multigranular Benchmarks: Could you elaborate on how MedTrinity-25M compares with existing benchmarks that involve multigranular information? What distinguishes your dataset from these, and how does it contribute uniquely to the advancement of general medical AI?\n- Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: Given that the dataset is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, which may not fully utilize multigranular annotations, do you have plans to test your dataset on tasks specifically designed for multigranular information? How can you demonstrate the effectiveness of your dataset's detailed annotations in improving model performance on such tasks?\n- Addressing Unique Medical Image Presentations in RAG: Medical images often present unique and variable features even when categorized under the same disease label. How does your RAG approach handle the specificity and variability of individual medical image descriptions? For instance, with conditions like Atelectasis that can manifest differently in imaging, how does the system ensure that the generated annotations accurately reflect these variations?"
