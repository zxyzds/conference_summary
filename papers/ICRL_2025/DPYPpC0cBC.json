    "title": "Beyond Predefined Depots: A Dual-Mode Generative DRL Framework for Proactive Depot Generation in Location-Routing Problem",
    "abstract": "The Location-Routing Problem (LRP), which combines the challenges of facility (depot) locating and vehicle route planning, is critically constrained by the reliance on predefined depot candidates, limiting the solution space and potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. Previous research on LRP without predefined depots is scant and predominantly relies on heuristic algorithms that iteratively attempt depot placements across a planar area. Such approaches lack the ability to proactively generate depot locations that meet specific geographic requirements, revealing a notable gap in current research landscape. To bridge this gap, we propose a data-driven generative DRL framework, designed to proactively generate depots for LRP without predefined depot candidates, solely based on customer requests data which include geographic and demand information. It can operate in two distinct modes: direct generation of exact depot locations, and the creation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution for flexible depots sampling. By extracting depots' geographic pattern from customer requests data, our approach can dynamically respond to logistical needs, identifying high-quality depot locations that further reduce total routing costs compared to traditional methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, for a same group of customer requests, compared with those depots identified through random attempts, our framework can proactively generate depots that lead to superior solution routes with lower routing cost. The implications of our framework potentially extend into real-world applications, particularly in emergency medical rescue and disaster relief logistics, where rapid establishment and adjustment of depot locations are paramount, showcasing its potential in addressing LRP for dynamic and unpredictable environments.",

                "value": "I am afraid to write such a negative review, which will clearly be a disappointment for the authors, but in my opinion this paper should not be published for the reasons outlined below. I hope that my concerns will still help the authors to refine their research in the future.\n\n1) As the authors point out in the literature review part of their work, research on solving LRPs without predefined depot locations is very scarce. From my experience in academia and practice, there is a good reason why this research is scarce: solving an LRP without predefined depot locations is a problem that is hardly of interest to the underlying applications.\nThe depots which are placed when solving an LRP are typically warehouses or logistics hubs. Suitable locations for such buildings are usually sparse, which is why there always exists a predefined discrete set of potential locations, which makes the problem proposed by the authors obsolete. \nIf one wants to identify suitable regions for depots, one usually solves a facility location problem and uses a cost approximation for routing costs as in such a setting where the problem is solved in a continuous plane, the error made by placing the depot locations at points that are not available as a location is high and outweighs a potential accuracy win on getting accurate routing costs.\n\n2) While I believe that utilizing DRL for vehicle routing problems is still in its infancy and holds potential for many promising research contributions, I doubt that aiming to solve strategic planning problems with similar methodologies for two reasons: first, when solving a strategic problem the sunk costs are very high. In this case, one favors solution quality and accuracy, realized in classical combinatorial or robust optimization approaches, over fast decision-making, which is the main advantage of a DRL approach. Second, while one can easily create many training instances for an operational problem by collecting daily or hourly data, this is different for a strategic problem that is solved once every 10 to 20 years. I do not see any reasonable way to create the 1,280,000 instances the authors require for training.\n\nIgnoring the unrealistic training process, a superior solution quality could justify the method proposed by the authors from a purely academic perspective. However, the reported solution quality is inferior to that of existing classical approaches. Here it might be worth mentioning that the reference solutions claimed to be the state of the art by the authors are roughly 15 years old. Many papers have improved upon these so that the gap between the proposed methodology and the actual state of the art is much larger.\n\nBased on these main concerns, I see neither a pracitcal nor an academic value in the work proposed and recommend to not publish it."

This impression gets reinforced specifically in B.4 where authors address limitations and future work, two topics that typically included into the main text and not in the appendices.

                "value": "1. The design of MDLRAM seems to be less supported by the motivation of the paper: the paper stresses the importance of proactively generating depot candidates for flexibility. However, the MDLRAM is a fixed model that takes in a fixed set of customers and depots as input and outputs the routing solution. There is no flexibility provided for changing depots or dynamically planning the routing as the DGM is generating the depots. Considering that the performance of MDLRAM is also inferior to SOTA method, it's unclear what major advantage MDLRAM brings.\n2. A potential design flaw in the experiments could be that the evaluation of the DGM model depends on the score given on the MDLRAM model. This could potentially introduce bias since the DGM model is trained to score well for the MDLRAM while the MDLRAM does not provide exact solution or SOTA solution.\n3. Randomly generating the depot locations seems to be too weak of a baseline. The heuristics mentioned in the Related Works seems to better candidates."

If flexibility is needed, why not design a more end-to-end framework to connect DGM and MDLRAM and dynamically generate depots and plan routing accordingly.\n2. For the evaluation of MDLRAM, for the synthetic data and real-world data settings, different sets of baselines seem to be chosen for comparison. Why is that? The description for the baselines for the synthetic data setting also seems to be lacking. What are ALNS, GA, TS referring to?\n3. How would the DGM-Gaussian mode provide more flexibility when compared with the exact mode? Could the authors provide an example of a use case  for the Gaussian mode to motivate it more?"

It involves a depot generative model that uses demand information to sample depot locations, and a critic model that scores the generated depot locations to further output location-routing solutions. The motivation behind such a two-module design is missing and by having the two separated procedures (i.e., location and then routes), the optimality of the solutions based on the Deep Reinforcement Learning for the integrated location-routing problem does not seem to be guaranteed anymore. The paper also lacks theoretical analysis about the optimality bound guarantee nor the efficiency of the algorithm. The training strategies are also ad hoc and do not have a firm theoretical ground. \n\nAt a high level, while location-routing is a class of classical transportation problems, the version considered in this paper is not considered state of the art, and the literature now has been focusing on optimizing location solutions and controlling dynamic routes (in an online fashion) under uncertain demand and route information. Therefore, how the proposed methods add to the existing knowledge is not clear to me."
