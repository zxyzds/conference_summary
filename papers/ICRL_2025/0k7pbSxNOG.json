    "title": "Fast Crystal Tensor Property Prediction: A General O(3)-Equivariant Framework Based on Polar Decomposition",
    "abstract": "Predicting tensor properties of the crystalline materials is a fundamental task in materials science. Unlike single-value property prediction, which is inherently invariant, tensor property prediction requires maintaining $O(3)$ group tensor equivariance. This equivariance constraint often introduces tremendous computational costs, necessitating specialized designs for effective and efficient predictions. \nTo address this limitation, we propose a general $O(3)$-equivariant framework for fast crystal tensor prediction, called {\\em GoeCTP}. \nOur framework is efficient as it does not need to impose equivalence constraints onto the network architecture. Instead, {\\em GoeCTP} captures the tensor equivariance with a simple external rotation and reflection (R\\&R) module based on the polar decomposition. The crafted external R\\&R module can rotate and reflect the crystal into an invariant standardized crystal position in space without introducing extra computational cost. We show that {\\em GoeCTP} is general as it is a plug-and-play module that can be smoothly integrated with any existing single-value property prediction network for predicting tensor properties. Experimental results indicate that the {\\em GoeCTP} method achieves higher prediction performance and runs 13$\\times$ faster compared to existing state-of-the-art models in elastic benchmarking datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.",

The invariant predictions are then mapped back to equivariant outputs. While the goal of O(3) equivariant predictions is notable, prior work has already addressed this problem with established solutions, including ETGNN's vector outer product and GMTNet's equivariant networks. Additionally, existing techniques, such as frame averaging and minimal frame averaging, can be employed to achieve O(3) tensor equivariance effectively. Moreover, this work does not consider space group constraints, which are crucial for tensorial properties in crystallography. As such, the novelty and contribution of this work are limited and do not meet the standards for acceptance at current form."

                "value": "1. **Lack of Consideration for Space Group Constraints**\n\nSpace group constraints, which are fundamental in determining the tensor properties of crystals, are not accounted for in this work. No experimental results are provided to verify whether the proposed method can generate predictions that align with these constraints. Crystals exhibit unique tensor characteristics that are intrinsically tied to their crystal class or space group, and ignoring these symmetries is a significant oversight.\n\n2. **Limited Improvement in Performance**\n\nThe integration of the proposed module does not enhance eComformer\u2019s performance beyond achieving O(3) equivariance, as shown in Table 4. Other alternatives, such as ETGNN, frame averaging, and minimal frame averaging, also achieve O(3) equivariance but were not discussed or compared in this work. A more thorough discussion and comparative analysis of technical contributions and novelty would be beneficial.\n\n3. **Absence of Experiments on Piezoelectric Tensors**\n\nThe work lacks experiments on piezoelectric tensors, which are especially sensitive to space group constraints. Including these experiments would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed approach\u2019s applicability across tensorial properties with varying sensitivity to symmetry constraints.\n\n4. **Performance on Elastic Tensors**\n\nThe performance of the proposed method on elastic tensors is significantly lower than GMTNet's original results. This suggests potential limitations in the approach\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n5. **Efficiency Gains Not Attributable to Proposed Method**\n\nThe efficiency gains claimed largely derive from the use of the lightweight eComformer, not the proposed approach. Similar speed-ups could be achieved by combining eComformer with other O(3) equivariant methods such as ETGNN\u2019s vector outer-product approach or minimal frame averaging."

As the authors discuss between lines 137 and 142, \" the requirements for O(3) equivariance typically differ from the O(3)-equivariance\ndefined in the general molecular studies.\" Because of these specific requirements, the scope and the applicability of the proposed polar decomposition are limited."
