    "abstract": "Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. However, humans can imagine unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and revise their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions at the current step, without having to physically explore the world first. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the **Generative World Explorer (Genex)**, a video generation model that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train Genex, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) Genex can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon mental exploration of large 3D scenes and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.",

POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) is a modeling framework that can be applied to describe the behavior of an agent in an environment where full state information is not available. Visual observation is only one channel for information acquisition. Saying that incomplete visual observation necessarily leads to a POMDP is also not very rigorous."

And for multi-agent, try to make the other two agents avoid collision. The task setting seems not challenging and common enough to demonstrate the usefulness of such imagination ability. Also it\u2019s hard to see the real performance through such discrete choice-making decision accuracy. Potentially, the method can serve as a role to generate the bird-eye map from a single panorama image and can reveal the hidden cars not in the observation. \n2.

In this work, the authors aim to define an embodied agent with belief revision driven by imagination, which is able to imagine hidden views through imaginative exploration..\n3. Two new datasets called Genex-DB and Genex-EQA have been collected to facilitate the proposed pipeline.

While the authors show an approach to link the panoramic video generation with embodied QA, the experiments do not explicitly demonstrate the effectiveness of the ''imagination generation''. How about the results of POMDP without imagination\uff1f\n2. As far as the reviewer knows, most of the generation models (including the SVD used in this paper) are poor in the reasoning ability, because essentially they are just simulating the probability of objects appearing. In most cases, if there are no explicit constraints like specified object category, the generation model wouldn't expect an ambulance to be here in most cases. This is an open question and the reviewer wants to see the point of the authors. Additionally, could the authors provide more examples of the imagination results, particularly challenging cases like those shown in Fig.12?\n3. Some **concerns about the Genex-EQA questions**. The questions and answers in the dataset are quite subjective. For example in the second row and second column in Fig.12, the gt choice is \"Signal the car to stop for the pedestrian\". This action seems impractical for an autonomous driving vehicle. Further clarification on the methodology and rationale behind the question and answer collection process is needed to understand the dataset's reliability.\n4. For panoramic video generation task, though the method serves as a baseline, it is beneficial to have **some comparisons with previous single-view world models** (because they can also perform panoramic video generation task by just replacing the data) and demonstrate why these models fail to generate panoramic videos."
