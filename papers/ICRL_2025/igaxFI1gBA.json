    "title": "Temporal Causal Discovery and Generative Prediction of Vehicular CO$_2$ emission",
    "abstract": "Global warming from greenhouse gas emissions is humanity's largest environmental hazard. Greenhouse gases, like CO$_2$ emissions from transportation, notably cars, contribute to the greenhouse effect. Effective CO$_2$ emission monitoring is needed to regulate vehicle emissions. Few studies have predicted automobile CO$_2$ emissions using OBD port data. For precise and effective prediction, the system must capture the underlying cause-effect structure between vehicular parameters that may contribute to the emission of CO$_2$ in the transportation sector. Thus, we present a causal RNN-based generative deep learning architecture that predicts vehicle CO$_2$ emissions using OBD-II data while keeping the underlying causal structure. Most widely used real-life datasets lack causal relationships between features or components, so we use our proposed architecture to discover and learn the underlying causal structure as an adjacency matrix during training and employ that during forecasting. Our framework learns a sparse adjacency matrix by imposing a sparsity-encouraging penalty on model weights and allowing some weights to be zero. This matrix is capable of capturing the causal relationships between all variable pairs. In this work, we first train the model with widely used synthetic datasets with known causal structure among variables, then we apply it to the state-of-the-art OBD-II dataset to find the internal causal structure among the vehicular parameters and perform causal inference to predict CO$_2$ emission. Experimental results reveal that our causal discovery and forecasting method surpasses state-of-the-art methods for the tasks of causal discovery in terms of AUROC, forecasting on multivariate causal time series data, and OBD-II dataset in terms of MMD, RMSE, and MAE. After successful completion, we will release the code (Code for review - https://anonymous.4open.science/r/causal-obd-co2-0A0C).",

The importance of causal discovery for emission forecasting needs further clarification, including why causality between time series is significant for emission forecasting. For example, the causal analysis for traffic forecasting can help traffic managers know the reason for the jam happening.\n\n2. The proposed method lacks novelty. The approach does not include designs specific to CO2 characteristics and relies solely on existing RNN-based architectures. Why do current approaches for time series forecasting struggle with accurately predicting CO2 emissions?\n\n3. The selection of baselines for the forecasting task is insufficient, as it lacks recent state-of-the-art methods from the past three years. \n\n4. While causal discovery appears effective, it lacks validation with real-world data. Case studies are needed to demonstrate its practical application. You can do case studies on the real-world dataset you provide, and show the discovery results."

It is important to show the potentially causal variables in the context of the CO2 forecasting problem. If text space is a concern, these details should be included in the appendix. \nAdditionally, if you can provide a brief explanation or demonstration of why understanding the intrinsic causal relationships in multivariate data leads to better generative time series forecasting, it would be a significant enhancement to the paper. Your current equations are close to achieving this, but the argument needs a bit more development.\n\n3.Experimental Issue:\nFor the generative forecasting experiments, the authors compare TGAN (2019), VRNN (2015), and VRAE (2013). The choice of these baselines demonstrates the authors\u2019 thoughtful consideration by directly comparing their work to the most relevant generative forecasting methods. However, in recent years, several emerging approaches for multivariate time series generative forecasting have been proposed, such as ScoreGrad (2021) and D3VAE (NeurIPS, 2022).\nFor simple RNN-based forecasting, I find that including only one RNN model as a baseline for non-generative multivariate time series modeling is insufficient. More recent and effective models should be considered in this context. Given the standards of ICLR, the experimental setup presents notable shortcomings."

                "value": "1. A statement is not strict enough\uff1a\nThe claim that the work you're referring to is the first to use a recurrent variational autoencoder (VAE) for time series forecasting is not entirely accurate. Previous research has already explored using Variational Recurrent Autoencoders (VRAE) for time series data. One notable example is the VRAE model (2014), VRNN (2015). The novelty of your mentioned work could lie in the specific architecture or methodology used, such as the incorporation of causal discovery through Granger causality and the multi-head decoder design, which may not have been part of earlier models. Could you further improve your claim about this?\n2. Could you attempt to briefly demonstrate or explain why a better understanding of the intrinsic causal relationships within multivariate data can lead to improved multivariate time series generation?\nSince the experimental results are not particularly strong, clarifying the rationale and theory behind your approach would help improve the overall quality and coherence of the paper.\n3. As for supplementing the experiments, I recommend following the suggestions and opinions of other reviewers, especially about the multivariate time series model forecasting besides RNN.  I may not increase or decrease the score based on whether additional experiments are included in rebuttal phase.  The second item is more important for me."
