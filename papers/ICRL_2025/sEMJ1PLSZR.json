    "title": "Adaptive Energy Alignment for Accelerating Test-Time Adaptation",
    "abstract": "In response to the increasing demand for tackling out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, test-time adaptation (TTA) has garnered significant research attention in recent years. To adapt a source pre-trained model to target samples without getting access to their labels, existing approaches have typically employed entropy minimization (EM) loss as a primary objective function. In this paper, we propose an adaptive energy alignment (AEA) solution that achieves fast online TTA. We start from the re-interpretation of the EM loss by decomposing it into two energy-based terms with conflicting roles, showing that the EM loss can potentially hinder the assertive model adaptation. Our AEA addresses this challenge by strategically reducing the energy gap between the source and target domains during TTA, aiming to  effectively align the target domain with the source domains and thus to accelerate adaptation. We specifically propose two novel strategies, each contributing a necessary component for TTA: (i) aligning the energy level of each target sample with the energy zone of the source domain that the pre-trained model is already familiar with, and (ii) precisely guiding the direction of the energy alignment by matching the class-wise correlations between the source and target domains. Our approach demonstrates its effectiveness on various domain shift datasets including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and TinyImageNet-C.",

                "value": "The paper introduces an energy-based approach for addressing the test-time adaptation (TTA) problem. The authors analyze the classical entropy minimization loss widely adopted by existing TTA methods through the lens of energy-based model, pinpointing the potential issue lies within the entropy minimization. To address the issue, two alignment objectives termed source-free energy alignment (SFEA) and logit cosine similarity (LCS) are proposed. SFEA aligns the overall energy magnitudes between source and target domains to reduce the energy gap during adaptation, whereas LCS ensures the class-wise correlation of the target domain maintains consistent during energy alignment. Experiments are conducted on several common TTA benchmarks including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, TinyImageNet-C and ImageNet-C, as well as style shift dataset PACS. The results of the proposed method generally surpass the baselines."

                "value": "1.\tIn both the summary and the introduction, the authors argue that \u201cthe EM loss can be decomposed into two energy-based terms with conflicting roles\u201d and such confliction \u201chinders the energy gap reduction when the EM loss is used alone.\u201d However, the authors do not address this issue in the proposed method. Minimizing the target energy does not resolve the conflict. On the contrary, the reviewer thinks that the free-energy maximization term in equation (4) is necessary for avoiding the explosion of the magnitude of logits. The reviewer\u2019s opinion is supported by the fact that the final objective of the proposed method still incorporates EM loss. \n2.\tThe authors highlight the strength of the proposed method that can reduce the energy gap more quickly than EM loss in the early batches. However, it appears from fig. 2 that the proposed method performs similarly to other baselines at the beginning. The result makes the author\u2019s claim questionable.\n3.\tGiven that previous works [1][2] adopt hinge loss for energy alignment, the reviewer suggests that the authors should conduct ablation study on the choice of loss to support their design.\n4.\tFor each target batch, the proposed method computes a new approximated energy of the source domain, which means that the estimated source energy varies over time. This is a seemingly strange design without explanation. In fact, the reviewer suspects that this particular design is the actual reason for performance enhancement and distinguishes it from the previous energy alignment method. In reviewer\u2019s opinion, the target energy is not actually aligned with the source energy, but rather is minimized towards an adaptively changing goal. This allows the energy minimization process to be more flexible and friendly to the model training.\n5.\tThe second line of equation (4) is mistaken. It should include parentheses over the two energy terms. \n\nRef: \n[1] Energy-based out-of-distribution detection.\n[2] Active learning for domain adaptation: An energy-based approach."

Second, though the authors have tried to describe the correlation between energy gap reduction and better adaptation, it's not clear why TTA needs to do this. Especially, many previous works have proven its effectivebess in addressing distribution shift problems .Third, the proposed method is complicated but the improvements in Tables 1,2,3 is minor. \n\n- **Insufficient justifications.** From main results of Table 1,2,3, it can be observed that the proposed AEA obtains limited improvements in three small-scale image classification datasets (CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and TinyImageNet-C). Large-scale datasets and other tasks like segmentation or detection might be evaluated to demonstrate the AEA's utlization in various scenarios and applications."

How can this calculation method avoid the noise caused by bath sampling?\n\nMinor comments:\n- Actually, the foundamental of this work is to answer why does energy alignment lead to better adaptation. Thus, in my view, Sec. A.4 should be moved to the main context and the revisit of EMBs can be moved to the appendix."
