    "title": "Dataset Size Recovery from Fine-Tuned Weights",
    "abstract": "Model inversion and membership inference attacks aim to reconstruct and verify the data on which a model was trained. However, these methods cannot guarantee to find all training samples, as they do not know the training set size. In this paper, we introduce a new task: dataset size recovery, which seeks to identify the number of samples a given model was fine-tuned on. \nOur core finding is that both the norm and the spectrum of the fine-tuning weight matrices are closely linked to the fine-tuning dataset size. Leveraging this insight, we propose DSiRe, an algorithm that accepts fine-tuned model weights, extracts their spectral features, and then employs a nearest neighbor classifier on top, to predict the dataset size. Although it is training-free, simple, and very easy to implement, DSiRe is broadly applicable across various fine-tuning paradigms and modalities (e.g., DSiRe can predict the number of fine-tuning images with a mean absolute error of $0.36$ images). To this end, we develop and release LoRA-WiSE, a new benchmark consisting of over $25k$ weight snapshots from more than $2k$ diverse LoRA fine-tuned models.",

The authors define a data-driven pipeline to achieve this: several fine-tuned weights and their corresponding dataset sizes are provided as training samples, and during testing, a newly fine-tuned model is given. The goal is to predict the dataset size of this test model. Specifically, they propose extracting spectral features from the model weights and using these features to predict dataset size with a nearest neighbor algorithm. For experiments, the authors introduce a new benchmark named LoRA-WiSE, where various stable diffusion models are fine-tuned with LoRA parameterizations across different dataset sizes. They demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by presenting mean absolute error (MAE) scores across three data regimes: low (up to 6 samples), medium (up to 50 samples), and high (up to 1,000 samples)."

The method appears to predict the fine-tuning dataset size for a given model only when \u201ctraining samples\u201d\u2014pairs of model weights and corresponding fine-tuning dataset sizes\u2014are available. However, it remains unclear how one would construct these training samples in practice, particularly without prior information about the actual fine-tuning dataset used by the model. \n\n2. Beyond dataset size, other factors likely influence the norms and spectra of the learned weights, such as the diversity of the fine-tuning dataset or its divergence from the pretraining dataset. Without direct knowledge of the fine-tuning data, these factors remain uncontrolled. For instance, a model fine-tuned on a large but homogeneous dataset may exhibit more overfitting than one fine-tuned on a small yet diverse dataset, resulting in higher norms or spectral values. This raises concerns regarding the method\u2019s practical applicability.\n\n3. As shown in Figure 2, the distinctions between different fine-tuning dataset sizes diminish as dataset size increases, making it unclear how effective the method remains for larger datasets.\n\n4. The experiments focus solely on a stable diffusion model, leaving questions about the method\u2019s generalizability to other model types. Additionally, why is the method restricted to fine-tuned weights? Could it be extended to estimate the dataset size for a model trained from scratch, and would the trends observed in Figure 2 apply in that context?"

Given that data augmentation is a common practice in model training, understanding its impact on the proposed method's accuracy is crucial. It would be valuable to include experiments or discussions on how data augmentation could alter spectral and norm properties in fine-tuned weights.\n\nWhile the paper explores estimating dataset size, it would be insightful to discuss how this information could impact model inversion techniques or the general machine learning community.
