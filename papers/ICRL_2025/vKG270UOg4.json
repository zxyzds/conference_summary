    "title": "BDC-Occ: Binarized Deep Convolution Unit For Binarized Occupancy Network",
    "abstract": "Existing 3D occupancy networks demand significant hardware resources, hindering the deployment of edge devices. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a potential solution by substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. However, their performances decrease notably compared to full-precision networks. In addition, it is challenging to enhance the performance of the binarized model by increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers, which limits its practicability for 3D occupancy prediction. This paper presents two original insights into binarized convolution, substantiated with theoretical proofs: (a) $1\\times1$ binarized convolution introduces minimal binarization errors as the network deepens, and (b) binarized convolution is inferior to full-precision convolution in capturing cross-channel feature importance. Building on the above insights, we propose a novel binarized deep convolution (BDC) unit that significantly enhances performance, even when the number of binarized convolutional layers increases. Specifically, in the BDC unit, additional binarized convolutional kernels are constrained to $1\\times1$ to minimize the effects of binarization errors. Further, we propose a per-channel refinement branch to reweight the output via first-order approximation. Then, we partition the 3D occupancy networks into four convolutional modules, using the proposed BDC unit to binarize them. The proposed BDC unit minimizes binarization errors and improves perceptual capability while significantly boosting computational efficiency, meeting the stringent requirements for accuracy and speed in occupancy prediction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that the proposed BDC unit supports state-of-the-art precision in occupancy prediction and object detection tasks with substantially reduced parameters and operations. Code is provided in the supplementary material and will be open-sourced upon review.",

                "value": "This paper introduces BDC-Occ, a novel binarized neural network (BNN) for 3D occupancy prediction. Recognizing the computational challenges of deploying existing 3D occupancy networks on edge devices, the authors leverage BNNs for model compression. However, they note that simply binarizing existing models leads to performance degradation, particularly when increasing network depth.\n\nThe paper's core contribution is the Binarized Deep Convolution (BDC) unit.  It addresses the identified limitations of binarized convolutions through two key innovations. First, additional convolutional kernels within the BDC are constrained to 1x1 to minimize the impact of binarization errors as network depth increases. Second, a per-channel refinement branch reweights outputs using a first-order approximation, improving the capture of cross-channel feature importance.\n\nThrough extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, the authors demonstrate that BDC-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance among BNNs, even rivaling full-precision models in mIoU while significantly reducing parameters and operations.  They further validate the generalizability of the BDC unit by showing its effectiveness in 3D object detection tasks on the nuScenes dataset."

                "value": "Originality: The paper demonstrates originality in its identification and solution for the performance degradation problem in binarized 3D occupancy networks. While BNNs have been explored in other domains, applying them effectively to 3D occupancy prediction, especially with a focus on maintaining performance with increasing network depth, is novel. The proposed BDC unit, with its 1x1 kernel constraint and the per-channel refinement branch, presents a creative combination of techniques tailored to address the specific challenges of binarization in this context.\n\nQuality: The technical quality of the paper is good. The authors provide theoretical justification for their design choices and conduct thorough experiments to validate the effectiveness of the BDC unit. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of BDC-Occ over other state-of-the-art binarized methods and its competitiveness with full-precision models. The ablation studies further strengthen the claims by showcasing the individual contributions of each component of the BDC unit.\n\nClarity: While the core ideas are presented clearly, the clarity of the paper could benefit from some improvements. The mathematical proofs are clear. Additionally, visually presenting the overall architecture of BDC-Occ aid understanding.\n\nSignificance: The significance of the work lies in its potential to enable deployment of accurate 3D occupancy prediction on edge devices. The substantial reduction in computational cost achieved by BDC-Occ, without sacrificing accuracy, is notable. It would be nice to discuss the roadmap to apply on transformer, to inspire further researches."

However, it lacks a comparison with other model compression methods beyond binarization, such as pruning [4], quantization [5], or knowledge distillation [6].  Demonstrating the advantages of BDC-Occ over these alternatives would significantly bolster its practical significance.\n\n3. **[minor] Limited generalizability**: The paper acknowledges the limitation to CNN architectures.

Furthermore, exploring ternary or higher bit-width quantization could provide a more nuanced understanding of the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.\n\n2. **[minor] Comparison with Other Compression Methods**:  Beyond BNNs, how does BDC-Occ compare to other model compression techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation in the context of 3D occupancy prediction?  Providing quantitative results or discussion comparing these methods would strengthen the argument for BDC-Occ's practical value.\n\n3. **Detailed Analysis of Per-Channel Refinement Branch**:  The ablation study provides some insights, but a more in-depth analysis of the per-channel refinement branch is needed.  How sensitive is its performance to the number of layers in `MulBiconv` (N)? Are there alternative architectures for this branch that could further improve cross-channel feature learning? A visualization of the learned channel weights might also offer insightful qualitative analysis.\n\n4. **[minor] Generalizability to Transformers**: The stated limitation to CNN architectures raises questions about BDC's broader applicability. Have the authors explored applying BDC, or a modified version, to Transformer-based occupancy networks?  Even negative results in this direction would be valuable for understanding the challenges and potential future work."

This research addresses these challenges by exploring strategies to minimize computational overhead, a vital area of study given the increasing emphasis on edge computing in autonomous systems. By carefully engineering these binarization blocks, the proposed approach effectively mitigates quantization loss, thus maintaining model accuracy while reducing resource consumption."

                "value": "# Major Concern:\nWhile this work serves as an early exploration of binary quantization for the occupancy prediction task, several significant limitations are apparent. The study does present two main findings in the context of binary occupancy networks:\n- 1\u00d71 binarized convolution introduces only minimal binarization errors as network depth increases.\n- Binarized convolution is notably less effective than full-precision convolution at capturing cross-channel feature importance.\n\nHowever, the proposed strategies to address these issues\u2014namely, enhancing network depth through additional 1x1 binarized layers and adding a per-channel refinement branch\u2014have already been extensively explored in the quantization literature. This repetition limits the novelty of the work, and the paper does not provide fresh insights into the specific task of occupancy prediction. The binary quantization methods introduced here, while perhaps incrementally improving upon existing binary quantization techniques, do not directly tackle the occupancy task itself. Instead, they represent a basic application of binary quantization to occupancy, yielding largely expected results. As such, I believe this work falls short of the standards expected at a top-tier machine learning conference, and the main track may not be the optimal venue for this submission.\n\n# Minor Comments:\n- This study restricts its exploration to CNN-based approaches for occupancy tasks, without incorporating transformer-based occupancy networks. Transformer models have gained traction and demonstrated superior performance in related fields, and their absence here limits the study\u2019s relevance to current research trends.\n- The paper outlines a manually crafted binary network architecture aimed at mitigating quantization-induced errors. However, quantizing both weights and activations from 32-bit to 1-bit introduces significant quantization errors. Without innovations specifically targeted at reducing such errors in this context, the proposed method struggles to demonstrate substantial improvements.\n- The speed advantage observed (6.22 FPS versus 7.53 FPS) is marginal, casting doubt on the practical benefits and motivation of the approach. If the goal is to address computational cost and memory constraints in existing occupancy networks, a rigorous analysis of actual speedup and memory reduction should be provided. Alternatively, if the study\u2019s focus is to explore novel quantization techniques for this task, one would expect groundbreaking insights tailored to occupancy prediction. Given the current submission, both aspects seem underdeveloped."

Additionally, details on how 1-bit quantized convolution is implemented\u2014such as the use of custom kernels, acceleration libraries, or optimizations for reduced precision\u2014would provide readers with a clearer understanding of the practical feasibility and performance considerations of this approach.\n\n- If the work relies on standard hardware (e.g., CPUs or GPUs) without the assistance of dedicated quantization frameworks, this would impact performance significantly compared to using more specialized hardware like TPUs or FPGAs, which are often better suited for extreme quantization levels.
