    "title": "Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation",
    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches.",

                "value": "The authors present \"UNBOUNDED\" a virtual pet game based on LLMs. The authors present two novel technical elements to support this game: a regional IP-Adapter for character-environment consistency and a domain-specific distillation approach for finetuning a smaller LLM to allow for real time gameplay. The authors then present experiments comparing their approach to baselines in terms of visual quality and consistency, and overall game quality as scored by GPT-4o."

The paper is also overall well-written, especially in terms of the technical aspects. These primarily justify the positive aspects of my above scores."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has two major weaknesses in its present draft, the way it positions itself in terms of prior work and the evaluation. \n\n### Prior Work\n\nThe authors do not appear to have engaged with the field of technical games research at all. This is a shame, as their game can be understood as an AI-based game [1] or specifically a NN game [2]. More broadly, the authors' work in terms of generation would fit into the Procedural Content Generation paradigm [3]. There is a 3+ decades long history of work in this space that is relevant to the authors' work [4], with significant recent work at the intersection of LLMs and game generation [5], and it is crucial that the authors update the introduction and related work to situate their work within this field.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe authors primarily evaluate their work in terms of image quality and I have no major concern with these results (though the DreamSim results seem to incorrectly attribute the best score to their system). However, I have major concerns with the \"Evaluation of LLM Generations\", which is functionally the closest thing presented to a holistic evaluation of UNBOUNDED. Firstly, the norm within the area would be to make use of a user study for evaluation purposes [6,7]. Particularly since the authors make such an effort to allow for real time control, this would seem to follow naturally. Secondly, the evaluation is somewhat concerning due to the training process. Specifically, since the distillation approach makes use of GPT-4 to simulate user interaction data and the authors sample for uniqueness/variety, its fairly likely that the newly sampled user interaction data approximations will be very similar to these. Further, the largest model the authors compare to is again a GPT-4 variant. Given that GPT-4 is being used for both generation of data, as the system, and as the evaluation, there's a clear risk for bias. This could be addressed by any number of ways, including automated metrics for measuring game quality developed in prior game generation-like work [8,9]. But at present, it is difficult as an outside reader to get a sense of the actual quality of UNBOUNDED as a game. Failing this, it might be beneficial to include longer examples of gameplay in the supplementary materials at least.\n\n### Figures\n\nWhile these are not of major concern, I wanted to note two aspects of figures that I felt could be improved. First, the authors make use of a large number of fonts in their figures, and their primary font is a bit difficult to read. I'd suggest updating the figures to use a single, more legible font. Second, Figure 4 is largely superfluous. If the authors wish to retain it, it might be a better fit for an appendix.\n\n1. Treanor, M., Zook, A., Eladhari, M.

It appears to have innovated on a number of aspects, for instance the dynamic mask to balance character and environment generation. It gives some interesting, detailed, insights such as those of Figure 4. The improvement over IP-Adapter thus appears more than incremental. Another strong points is the Small LLM distillation framework.\nThe comparative LLM evaluation has staged an appropriate number of LLM, capturing size and diversity. \nFinally, the paper demonstrates a good command of recent relevant work and compares its approach to really recent alternative methods (2023, 2024), which is welcome."

                "value": "From a fundamental perspective, there is a lack of awareness of some game design issues. The introduction is relatively na\u00efve considering how these issues are addressed in game/play theory (Caillois, Huizinga). With the fine line between simulation and entertainment, and notwithstanding the reference to The Sims and Tamagotchi, contemporary audiences tend to have gameplay expectations that can only be met with sustained and meaningful (in the narrative sense) interactions. This feeds into the overall perspective of the evaluation methods which in the paper are primarily focused individual \u2018event\u2019 generation. While sustained UX evaluation may be at odds with the system\u2019s current level of maturity, some of this could have been addressed through even slightly longer exchanges or chains of events construed as minimal narrative experience (which is claimed in the abstract but does not really materialize in the examples). The small examples given, including on Figure 1, do not convey a very strong sense of gameplay. \n\nThere is no evidence that the number of user-simulator examples is at all sufficient for the intended purpose of multi-topic data collection. Nor is there any discussion of some hierarchical organization of topics that would come close to scenarios, game genres or elementary forms of plot backbones.\n\nDespite the statement on replicability, the level of implementation details is unclear. Implementation details are rather cursory and uneven with some in-depth details but no systematic discussion, and minor duplications from other sections.\n\nEvaluation has both positive (see above) and negative aspects.\nUnless I am mistaken, Table I shows a couple of inconsistencies for results.\nOn Environment Consistency, how can 0.322 be the best score when it is in-between 0.381 and 0.257? How can 0.675 be the best score in-between 0.595 and 0.832?\nIt is difficult to find the Qualitative component of evaluation very convincing in the absence of a more systematic approach for generating test situations. From a similar perspective, the example Prompts do not contain advanced mechanisms for controlling response, or specific examples. One would thus wonder how LLM response can be kept consistent across runs, and what type of statistical sampling has been associated to LLM use?"
