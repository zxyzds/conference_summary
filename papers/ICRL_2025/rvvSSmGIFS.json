    "title": "From Probability to Counterfactuals: the Increasing Complexity of Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy",
    "abstract": "The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: probabilistic (i.e. purely observational), interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas?  \n\nOur main contribution is to prove the exact computational complexities showing that languages allowing addition and marginalization (via the summation operator) yield NP^{PP}-, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. These are the first results to demonstrate a strictly increasing complexity across the PCH: from probabilistic to causal and counterfactual reasoning. On the other hand, in the case of full languages, i.e.~allowing addition, marginalization, and multiplication, we show that the satisfiability for the counterfactual level remains the same as for the probabilistic and causal levels, solving an open problem in the field.",

                "value": "The paper studies the computational complexity of the satisfiability problems of queries under different causal layers. In particular, it considers queries that may involve marginalizations ($\\sum$) and proves that the sat problems with basic and linear terms under L1, L2, L3 layers belong to the complexity classes of $NP^{PP}$, PSPACE, and NEXP. Moreover, it completes the open problem in Van der Zander et al. to show that the sat problem with polynomial term under L3 also belongs to succ-$\\exists R$."

I think providing more background on the complexity classes in the preliminaries section can be very helpful. Currently the paper points to [Arora & Barak 2009] textbook for more background about the complexity classes. If the page limit permits, it's better to summarize the definitions for each complexity class considered in this paper along with some complete problems in each class. This should make the paper more self-contained.\n2. A lot of contents in Appendix C should be moved to Section 2.1. For example, I got lost in the definitions of base, lin, and poly, etc.. Also, please provide some concrete examples so that we know immediately their differences.\n3. I think it is worth stressing that the satisfiability problem does not assume anything about SCMs, nor does the causal structure. In the classical work on the complexity of probabilistic inference, it is often assumed that both the structure and parameterizations are known (Remark 5 in the paper). In causal effect identification, the causal structure (graph) is often assumed to be known."

How does this relate to existing works on marginalizing (forgetting) variables from causal models?\n3.

The authors do not refer there to L1, L2, and L3, which makes it more harder to make this link.\n- An instance where the motivation could be improved, is Section 3, the sentences following that of Equation (3). There, the authors remark that adding marginalisation to a language does not change the expressivenes of it. It comes to wonder, then, why the authors are particularly interested in the questions they answer: if adding marginalisation does not change the expressivenes, why is it important to add this? The authors expand a bit on this in the Introduction, but I would rephrase the sentence here, or expand on it, in order to make the paper feel better motivated.\nAlso, how do we know that adding marginalisation to a language does not change the expressivenes of it? It may be a well known fact, but I would add a reference.\n\nI end this section with a small list of small remarks and typos:\n- Abstract, last sentence: Please be more specific about which open problem in which field. Ideally, give a reference that states that the problem you describe is open.\n- Page 2, line 065: add a space between \"see, e.g.,\" and \"(Pearl, 1988;\".\n- Page 6, line 314:  I would write that the sum \"ranges\" over all values, instead of \"sums\" over it."
