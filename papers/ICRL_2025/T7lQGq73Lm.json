    "title": "Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Enzyme Generation for Specified Substrate",
    "abstract": "The ability to generate novel enzymes that catalyze specific target molecules is a critical advancement in biomaterial synthesis and chemical production. However, a significant challenge arises when no recorded enzymes exist for the target molecule, making it a zero-shot generation problem. This absence of known enzymes complicates the training of generative models tailored to the target substrate. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation method that leverages existing enzyme-substrate data to overcome the lack of direct examples. Since there is no recorded catalytic performance between the enzymes and the new target molecule, the challenge shifts to identifying enzymes that helpful for generation. Our approach tackles this by retrieving enzymes whose substrates exhibit structural similarities to the target molecule, thereby exploiting functional similarities reflected in the enzymes' catalytic capability. This leads to the next challenge: how to utilize the retrieved enzymes to generate a novel enzyme capable of catalyzing the target molecule, given that none of the retrieved enzymes directly catalyze it. To solve this, we employ a conditioned discrete diffusion model that takes the aligned retrieved enzymes to generate a new enzyme. We train the generator with guidance from an enzyme-substrate relationship classifier to make it output the optimal protein sequence distribution for different target molecule. We evaluate our model on enzyme design tasks involving a diverse set of real-world substrates, and our results including catalytic rate predictions, foldability assessments, and docking position analyses, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing protein generation methods for substrate-specified enzyme generation. Additionally, we formally define the zero-shot substrate-specified enzyme generation task and contribute a comprehensive dataset with evaluation methods.",

In lieu of experimental validation, I would suggest rediscovery tasks to see if SENZ can design a known enzyme that is not present in the training set (i.e., still treating it as a zero-shot generation problem, but having a known solution, for validation).\n* It was not fully clear to me how SENZ sets itself apart from existing work in enzyme design. This could be made more clear. For reference, I work in moleular design, but I am not an expert in enzyme design and am not as familiar with the field, so some things may be obvious to you but they did not come across to me from reading the paper necessarily, and the respective advantages/limitations of SENZ could be made more explicit.\n* No code made available, as far as I can tell. Without this, I cannot make the score higher than 5, so please let me know if I have simply missed it and I can update my score to a 6 (there are ways to make code available anonymously).\n* Recommend to proofread the paper more carefully; minor grammatical mistakes here and there but nothing too distracting nor that made it impossible to understand the meaning, so I did not take off points for this. However, I wanted to point it out as in most cases they were mistakes that any grammar checker could catch with little time investment on behalf of the authors."

This would be really interesting to see, both in terms of sequence and structural similarity.\n* How do the authors handle potential post-translational modifications which could lead to improved/decreased enzyme activity relative to the reference enzyme?\n* It seems to me that there is a lot of information that the authors are currently not using in generating potential new proteins via SENZ (e.g., just the substrate, but not information on the generated products, any intermediates/transition states, 2D structures, etc, where known). I would imagine in the zero-shot setting it is quite important to include as much information as possible; how are the authors planning to incorporate this in future work to improve data efficiency?\n* What are the failure modes of SENZ?"

This significant difference raises concerns about the reliability of the evaluation metrics.\n\n\n(2) confusing annotations about probability and variables.\n\nFor example, in P5, line 268, the notation suggests that a probability $P$ is set equal to a variable $x$, which is conceptually unclear.\nSimilarly, in Equations (11) and (14), there appears to be a conflation between the variable $x$ and probability expressions."

Furthermore, the results are inconsistent, in some cases, the unconditional generation results outperform the conditional generation results.\n4.

If the target enzyme is a natural enzyme, we can always find the EC class in Brenda and the corresponding records in PDB and Uniprot. Then using a supervised method will definitely be better than zero-shot inference. If the target enzyme is a non-natural enzyme, I don't think the proposed retrieval method could find relative enzymes in the database just according to the substrate similarity cuz non-natural enzymes usually have their special properties.\n\n2. Some experimental settings and results are not reasonable or unclear to me:\n\n(1) For the baseline model ProGen2 and ProtGPT2, as they are unconditional models, how did them realize controllable enzyme design cuz they are just following autoregressive generation? If the authors just use random generation, then I don't think the comparison is fair. To achieve controllable design, why not use ProGen? There are several available models of ProGen2, which size is utilized? The pLDDT of ProGen2 is too low, why is that?\n\n(2) The pLDDT of all models are pretty low. For AF2, pLDDT 80 indicates stable design, I know ESMFold usually achieves a little bit lower pLDDT. But in Figure 2(b), none of the cases achieve a pLDDT higher than 80, indicating the proposed model cannot design foldable enzymes. \n\n(3) In Table 3, the novelty should be evaluated through BLASTp in Uniprot instead of just Swiss-Prot.\n\n3. For the guidance training method, how to guarantee a scoring function can be used to score enzyme-substrate pairs that it never sees during training? It's hard for me to trust it."

Can the author clearly state the inference process of all baseline models?\n\n4. For the success rate, what is the definition of \"successfully generated sequences\"? To me, it should both satisfy function constraint and structural stability. It seems all the designed enzymes didn't pass structural selection."
