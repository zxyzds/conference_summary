    "title": "The Advancement in Stochastic Zeroth-Order Optimization: Mechanism of Accelerated Convergence of Gaussian Direction on Objectives with Skewed Hessian Eigenvalues",
    "abstract": "This paper primarily investigates large-scale finite-sum optimization problems, which are particularly prevalent in the big data era. \nIn the field of zeroth-order optimization, stochastic optimization methods have become essential tools. \nNatural zeroth-order stochastic optimization methods are primarily based on stochastic gradient descent ($\\texttt{SGD}$).\nThe method of preprocessing the stochastic gradient with Gaussian vector is referred to as $\\texttt{ZO-SGD-Gauss}$ ($\\texttt{ZSG}$), while estimating partial derivatives along coordinate directions to compute the stochastic gradient is known as $\\texttt{ZO-SGD-Coordinate}$ ($\\texttt{ZSC}$).\nCompared to $\\texttt{ZSC}$, $\\texttt{ZSG}$ often demonstrates superior performance in practice.\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear in the academic community.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically analyze the potential advantages of $\\texttt{ZSG}$ compared to $\\texttt{ZSC}$.\nUnlike the fundamental assumptions applied in general stochastic optimization analyses, the quadratic regularity assumption is proposed to generalize the smoothness and strong convexity to the Hessian matrix. \nThis assumption allows us to incorporate Hessian information into the complexity analysis.\nWhen the objective function is quadratic, the quadratic regularity assumption reduces to the second-order Taylor expansion of the function, and we focus on analyzing and proving the significant improvement of $\\texttt{ZSG}$. \nFor other objective function classes, we also demonstrate the convergence of $\\texttt{ZSG}$ and its potentially better query complexity than that of $\\texttt{ZSC}$. \nFinally, experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis.",

The study addresses the notable performance gap between ZSG and ZSC, aiming to provide theoretical insights that explain ZSG's empirically observed advantages. To achieve this, the authors introduce the \"quadratic regularity assumption\" on the Hessian matrix, a relaxation of typical smoothness and strong convexity assumptions. They demonstrate that this assumption allows for incorporating Hessian information into complexity analysis, yielding convergence rates that reveal ZSG's improved efficiency in certain settings. The authors validate their analysis through synthetic and real-world experiments."

                "value": "1. The authors prove that ZSG converges with $tr(M)$, while previous work suggests that ZSC converges with $d\\lambda(M)$. Based on this, the authors claim that ZSG is better when $tr(M)\\leq d\\lambda(M)$. I don't think this is a correct statement. There is no result in the paper showing that ZSC cannot achieve the rate $tr(M)$, and its $d\\lambda(M)$ rate may come from the fact that previous analysis is not tight. To make the claim mathematically rigorous, the authors should provide the lower-bound under the current quadratic regularity assumption, showing that the rate of ZSC is $\\Omega(d\\lambda(M))$. Only then it is valid to say ZSG $\\leq tr(M) \\leq d\\lambda(M) \\leq$ ZSC.\n\n2. I am also not sure why ZSC cannot achieve the rate $tr(M)$. The current ZSC considered in the paper queries all $d$ dimension at each iteration. Its complexity is thus deducted as $d$ times that of first-order methods. However, in ZSC, one can also only do random sampling at each iteration. For example, sampling from $\\\\{1,2,\\cdots,d\\\\}$ instead of iterating over all $d$ dimension. This also builds a gradient estimator similar to ZSG, and similar analysis could apply. Specifically in the previous paper [Hanzely et al, 2018] and [Wang et al, 2024] mentioned by the authors, the rate of ZSC is also $tr(M)$ under the quadratic regularity assumption, e.g., Table 1 of [Hanzely, et al, 2018]. I am confused why authors say ZSC only achieves $d\\lambda(M)$.\n\n3. The rate of zeroth-order method has already been extensively studied under similar assumptions as the quadratic regularity assumption, e.g., [Malladi et al, 2023], [Yue et al, 2023], [arXiv: 2310.09639]. Stochastic mini-batch settings are also considered in these paper. Therefore, I am not sure how novel and challenge to obtain the results in the current paper given all these previous works.\n\n4. The author claims in Corollary 4.4 that the algorithm will not converge with a fixed stepsize. I don't think this is correct. One can choose $\\eta=(\\log T)/T$, and then the algorithm converges with rate $T=(1/\\epsilon)\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. Or can the authors clarify what they mean by a \"fixed\" step. In Corollary 4.6, when choosing $\\sigma=0$, the complexity should reduce to the deterministic linear rate $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. Is the current analysis tight?\n\n5. I feel the paper is written in a rush and not well polished. There are lots of mistakes in grammar. For example, it should be smoothness assumption and strong convexity assumption in line 144; line 162-163 is not well written English; In Theorem 4.3, 4.5, it should be \"let objective be quadratic\" and \"let x be update\", etc."

Loosely speaking, the iteration complexity of ZSG scales with $Trace(H)/ \\lambda_{\\min}(H)$, while the complexity of ZSC scales with $d*\\lambda_{\\max}(H)/\\lambda_{\\min}(H)$ where $H$ is the Hessian matrix, $d$ is the dimension.
