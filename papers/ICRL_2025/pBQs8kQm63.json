    "title": "Finite Sample Analyses for Continuous-time Linear Systems: System Identification and Online Control",
    "abstract": "Real world evolves in continuous time but computations are done from finite samples. Therefore, we study algorithms using finite observations in continuous-time linear dynamical systems. \nWe first study the system identification problem, and propose a first non-asymptotic error analysis with finite observations. Our algorithm identifies system parameters without needing integrated observations over certain time intervals, making it more practical for real-world applications. Further we propose a lower bound result that shows our estimator is provably optimal up to constant factors.\nMoreover, we apply the above algorithm to online control regret analysis for continuous-time linear system. Our system identification method allows us explore more efficiently, enabling the swift detection of ineffective policies. We achieve a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ over a single $T$-time horizon in a controllable system, requiring only $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ observations of the system.",

The extension to continuous time systems is interesting, but I don't see significant technical difficulty. Besides, most classical control literature considers continuous time linear systems already in the past, e.g. [W1]. The authors should provide a better summary of the technical novelty for their convergence rate analysis. \n\n2. The lower bound and the regret analysis also seem to be straightforward extensions of the existing results for the discrete time systems in [W2]. The authors should provide a better summary of the technical novelty for their lower bound analysis.\n\n\n[W1] Kopp, R.E. and Orford, R.J., 1963.

                "value": "1. This paper mentions that the one major motivation is practicability: most linear systems in practice are continuous time. But does this paper consider other practical issues, such as uneven time sampling? Does the algorithm still work if the time discretization is also noisy and uneven?\n\n2. Another practical issue is the imperfect state observation, i.e. the observation is $x_t+\\epsilon_t$. This is easier than output feedback but this is also a common issue in real-world applications. How can the proposed algorithm be generalized to handle imperfect state observations?"

For instance, it is a significant weakening to run the system of multiple trajectories, instead of a single, purely online, trajectory.\n3) The paper only studies the model of the LQR cost function (the main focus is more on stability, granted); but how does this extend to more general costs?\n4) The exact technical novelty of the paper seems to be unclear. For instance, optimizing while estimating system parameters is not new (The Nonstochastic Control Problem, Hazan et. al., Online Policy Optimization in Unknown Nonlinear Systems, et. al.). Maybe the authors can comment on why this result doesn't follow from the literature?\n5) Why aren\u2019t the time intervals $h$ chosen in a dynamic fashion? Surely, this would lead to better bounds? Right now, it seems $h=\\frac{1}{15\\kappa}$, where $\\kappa$ is assumed to be known in advance (this is potentially a very significant assumption since the entire point of the system identification is to estimate A and B).\n6) Line 162, would be good to clarify somewhere that $\\mathbb{S}_+$ represents the set of symmetric PSD matrices,\n7) Line 169, how do we know that the optimal mapping is unique? If it is not unique, then the convergence described in Line 176 is not guaranteed, right?\n8) Line 1456 - why is the determinant never 0?\n9) Line 283. How small should h be for the estimation to hold?\n10) Line 190. There are many notions of regret. It would be good for the authors to clarify that this is the expected regret of the system. In this sense, it seems that the paper overclaims a little at the start.\n11) Grammatical issues: line 483. $U^*$ should \u201cminimize\u201d cost, not minimizes. Line 502 - \u201canalyze\u201d, not \u201canalysis\u201d. Line 241. Missing an \u201cin\u201d between \u201crelationship\u201d and \u201cequation\"\n12) Missing references: Line 100 seems to be missing a reference for Simchowitz et. al, Line 293, 304, 306.

This assumption has been removed in the discrete-time setting (e.g. in Kargin, Lale, et al Thompson Sampling Achieves $O(\\sqrt{T})$ Regret in Linear Quadratic Control and the papers that follow that work.  \n\nSection 5.2 provides a detailed comparison to the line of work of Faradonbeh et al.  There is clearly a difference, however the delta does not seem to be large.  They previous work uses a slightly stronger assumption and the algorithm is different.  Removing the annoying log factor is a clear contribution, but the technical and algorithmic contribution is not as clear. \n\nThe results in the case where a stabilizing controller is not known are weaker than the other two main contributions.
