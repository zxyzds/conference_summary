    "title": "Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Feynman-Kac Model for Irregular Time Series",
    "abstract": "Many real-world datasets, such as healthcare, climate, and economics, are often collected as irregular time series, which poses challenges for accurate modeling. In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM employs amortized inference to decouple representation learning from the latent dynamics. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.",

                "value": "The authors propose ACSSM approach for modeling irregular time series which uses continuous-discrete state space models (CD-SSMs).  The authors extend doob's-h transform to multi-marginal case and solve the problem using stochastic optimal control. The formulation leads to a  evidence lower bound (ELBO) and the authors propose a VI based loss function to model the irregular time series. \n\nAuthors make linear approximation for the SDEs, which allows them to be able to perform simulation free estimation and exploit transformers for parallel computations. Overall, the proposed approach is faster and performs better than existing simulation based approaches, neural differential equations and other RNN based approaches tailored to handle irregular time series."

                "value": "The paper introduces the Amortized Control of Continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) to handle irregularly sampled time-series. ACSSM aims to model the path measure of trajectories in a latent space, conditioned on observations in the data space. By using a latent space, the model captures a flexible and structured representation of the underlying dynamics that generate observed data, which is especially useful for irregularly sampled observations. To construct this conditional path measure, the authors introduce a novel multi-marginal Doob\u2019s h-transform. This extension of the traditional Doob\u2019s transform induces a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that define the desired path measure in the latent space. However, simulating these SDEs directly is computationally infeasible due to the need for expensive normalization constants and conditional expectations. To overcome this challenge, the authors leverage stochastic optimal control to define a variational objective that approximates the optimal control needed to produce the conditioned dynamics. To further enhance computational efficiency, they propose working with affine linear SDEs with known Gaussian perturbation kernels, allowing simulation-free estimation of the latent trajectories and significantly speeding up the inference process."

To simulate the resulting continuous dynamics, they use VI to get an ELBO which is then optimized. To make this tractable, they assume that the latent dynamics are locally linear, and use a neural network to get expressive latent dynamics this way. The authors provide a theoretical analysis for this work, showing that the ELBO they obtain is tight, and then offer several experiments where this method shows improved performance over comparable baselines, for both per time classification/regression as well as sequence interpolation/extrapolation."
