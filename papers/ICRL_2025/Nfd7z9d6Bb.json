    "abstract": "We develop a new method for generating prediction sets that combines the flexibility of conformal methods with an estimate of the conditional distribution $\\textup{P}_{Y \\mid X}$. Existing methods, such as conformalized quantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, usually provide only a marginal coverage guarantee. In contrast, our approach extends these frameworks to achieve approximately conditional coverage, which is crucial for many practical applications. Our prediction sets adapt to the behavior of the predictive distribution, making them effective even under high heteroscedasticity. While exact conditional guarantees are infeasible without assumptions on the underlying data distribution, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the total variation distance of the conditional distribution and its estimate. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of conditional coverage, leading to more reliable statistical inference in a variety of applications.",

                "value": "This paper looks at the central issue of covariate-conditional validity of conformal prediction methods. They propose a systematic and novel procedure of turning a black box estimation of conditional distributions (Y|X) into a valid conformity score which then can be used to construct prediction sets. They carefully design the procedure to make their prediction sets adaptive to the behavior of the conditional distribution. Their method effectively generalizes the previous literature on using conditional distribution estimation by 1) providing algorithmic and theoretical results targeting conditional coverage and 2) going beyond one-dimensional regression setting."

They expand the ideas of using an estimation of conditional coverage to enhance the covariate-conditional performance of CP to the more general setting of multi-dimensional prediction tasks.\n- They also provide theoretical guarantees on the relation between the quality of the conditional distribution estimation and the improvements in the conditional coverage property of CP, which was a missing flavor for most of the previous works in this line of thinking."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- In general, the whole line of work based on estimations of conditional density suffers from the curse of dimensionality (covariate dimension). Therefore, it is important to see some empirical evaluations of the proposed method on high dimensional tasks (in particular image classification), even if it doesn't work very well, it helps the follow-up works with having a more accurate understanding of your method. Another interesting experiment to see is a synthetic regression task that you can directly plot the (conditional) coverage properties vs. dimension of the input and showcase the degree of tolerance of your proposed method. \n- Focusing on the lower dimensional tasks, where conditional density estimation is more feasible, It is good to see the performance of your proposed method in comparison with recent methods like the one proposed by https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12616. You can for instance set their function class to be a linear map form the data itself to a scalar threshold, or train a neural network regression model in the training time and then set the function class to be a linear head from the last layer of the trained neural network to a scalar threshold. In general, it is important to see whether using the conditional density estimation (when feasible) can actually beat the methods that does not rely on conditional density estimation.\n- Taking a step back, intuitively, it is obvious that the usage of an estimate of the conditional density estimation should improve the conditional coverage behavior of CP. However, it is not entirely obvious whether all the information in the density function is needed to construct perfect prediction sets. In other words, the key question is what parts of the information in the conditional density function are actually needed for constructing prediction sets. This question is very important to look at as the answer to it might reveal a way to beat the curse of dimensionality, as then you can only try to learn the useful information instead of the whole conditional density function. To this end, 1) it might be good (as a suggestion) to discuss this point of view (maybe as a future work) in your paper. In particular, how fundamental conditional density estimation is for your pipeline. 2) It is good to discuss the methods that are based on the described idea in your paper, for instance https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17487, as that helps the reader to have a better understanding of the whole methodology."

Theoretically, they provide a finite-sample marginal coverage guarantee as well as an asymptotic guarantee through a upper bound on conditional coverage.

While the paper offers a general construction for prediction sets, it shares ideas with existing methods such as (1) local conformal---the scaling part; (2) HPD split or distributional conformal prediction by Chernozhukov et al.---both using the conditional distribution estimator; and (3) sampling using generative models, inspired by Wang et al. Of course, the paper nicely combines these ideas into one framework, which is great, but I am not sure it brings a novel concept. I would be happy to get the author's feedback here: what is the concrete edge of the proposed method compared to prior work that also builds on conditional distribution estimation to promote adaptive/conditional coverage?\n\n2. I suggest better explaining the role of Z. It was not clear to me what the variable Z is until reaching line 252. For example, in line 152, it is not clear at all what you mean by \"sampled according to a kernel Z|X\". Consider improving the exposition in line 152, e.g., by providing a concrete example.\n\n3. Section 4.1: how does the CP^2-HPD perform compared to HPD-split by Izbicki et al. (2022)?
