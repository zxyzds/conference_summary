    "title": "Discovering Latent Structural Causal Models from Spatio-Temporal Data",
    "abstract": "Many important phenomenon in scientific fields such as climate, neuroscience and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a difficult problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to explicitly model latent time-series and their causal relationships from spatially confined modes in the data. Our method uses an end-to-end training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound (ELBO) for the data likelihood. Theoretically, we show that, under some conditions, the latent variables are identifiable up to transformation by an invertible matrix. Empirically, we show that SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, remains scalable for large grids, and identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a framework for causal discovery in latent variable models on spatiotemporal data. It presents a very flexible model where the latent variables are driven by SCMs defined on non-stationary time series, which are mapped to high-dimensional observations via an RBF kernel which addresses spatial correlations. The approach outperforms current approaches in spatiotemporal settings, and it is well-motivated on real climate data. However, the identifiability of the generative process is very weak and not acknowledged properly in the main text."

                "value": "The main weakness of the paper relies on **identifiability**. Below are all my concerns with regards to this matter. Other concerns will be written in the **Questions** part as I believe they are less important.\n- Identifiability is introduced without a proper definition in the introduction (it appears in line 67 for the first time). \n  - Identifiability should be defined along with corresponding citations to understand what is the equivalence you are looking for in your problem (I would assume graph structure).\n  - It should also be accompanied with motivation on why identifiability is important, e.g. proving you have a unique solution up to some equivalence, scientific discovery (assuming assumptions in real setups hold), etc.\n- Identifiability results are very weak considering the complexity of the data generating process. It only considers linear mixing which gives some affine identifiability (correct if mistaken), which feels redundant.\n  - Line 315: \"We focus on the specific case where no non-linearity maps the latents to the observable space\". Then, Theorem 2 establishes identifiability up to \" transformation by an invertible matrix\". The result does not feel very strong as it does not seem to go beyond linear mixing.\n  - Also given $Z\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times T}$, which is identifiable up to an invertible transformation, does this mean that theres mixing no only on $D$, but also over $T$? This should be clarified in the main text.\n- Identifiability does not cover all the target latent variables:\n  - Line 174: \u201cOur goal is to infer the latent variables and the true causal graph in an unsupervised manner\u201d. However, no identifiability results with respect to graph structure.\n  - Generally I don't consider the graph structure to be identifiable considering identifiability up to a linear transformation (correct me if I am mistaken). Even with permutation and scaling identifiability, I don't see how instantaneous effects can be discovered with your assumptions.\n  - For latent graph estimation: \n    - In the absence of instantaneous effects, I would expect first identifiability of the latent variables up to permutation and component-wise nonlinearity.\n    - With instantaneous effects, the task is even more challenging. Zhang et al 2024 recently has some results in non-temporal data.\n- The paper generally does not acknowledge the above limitations, which I find an important concern given the attention it gives to the theoretical part.\n  - Line 69: \u201cour framework can handle both instantaneous edges and overlapping spatial factors\u201d. Although it might be true empirically, this is not true with regards to identifiability. Therefore, I don't consider this claim to be valid.\n  - Line 532: \"We discussed the structural identifiability of our model\". Structural identifiability as defined by Peters et al. 2017, refers to identifiability of the causal graph. Therefore, this is not true if the above points are correct. \n\n**Note:** I would be happy to raise my score provided that this issue is addressed either by acknowledging this limitation in comparison to other works or establishing some stronger identifiability results (at least for the causal graph).\n\n**References**\n\nZhang, K., Xie, S., Ng, I. &amp; Zheng, Y..

This method aims to solve two problems associated with the previous method: 1) the high dimensionality of the spatio-temporal data; 2) correlations between spatially proximate points may bury the true causal relationships. To this end, we propose to first cluster the spatially adjacent points (denoted as a common spatial factor) and then infer the causal graph between the spatial factors. They prove the identifiability and use empirical experiments to validate their method."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. In the synthetic experiments, the generative model is assumed to follow the model assumptions and this explains the good performance of SPACY. However, for real-world data, the dependencies can be very complicated. How do we argue that such assumptions still hold? For example, there may still exist conditional dependencies between spatially proximate points, even conditioned on the common spatial factors and the causal graphs. Moreover, the instantaneous graph may not be causal, but undirected and cyclic instead. If the assumptions do not hold, can SPACY still offer some insight?\n2. What about the time-varying case? I think the time-varyinig assumption is more realistic. Perhaps the authors can include a discussion on how to extend SPACY to time-varying scenarios.\n3. Using variational inference to deal with such complicated latent space can be slow and may get stuck in local optima. It's better to discuss how the training time scales with the size of the latent space and how to find a good initial point for optimization / how to escape from the local optima."

In general, the linear identifiability requires supervision [1], and the permutation identifiability requires additional constraints on the generative process [2].

The linear identifiability is insufficient for the use case.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t think additional discussions are needed. \n\n[1] Khemakhem, Ilyes, et al. \"Variational autoencoders and nonlinear ica: A unifying framework.\" International conference on artificial intelligence and statistics.
