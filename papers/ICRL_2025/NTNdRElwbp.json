    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been highly successful in aligning large language models with human preferences. While prevalent methods like DPO have demonstrated strong performance, they frame interactions with the language model as a bandit problem, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where multi-turn conversations are common. Additionally, DPO relies on the Bradley-Terry model assumption, which does not adequately capture the non-transitive nature of human preferences. In this paper, we address these challenges by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player constant-sum Markov game, where each player seeks to maximize their winning rate against the other across all steps of the conversation. Our approach Multi-step Preference Optimization (MPO) is built upon the natural actor-critic framework. We further develop OMPO based on the optimistic online gradient descent algorithm. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis for both algorithms on convergence and show that OMPO requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ policy updates to converge to an $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium. We also validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on the multi-turn conversations dataset in MT-bench-101.",

Theoretical analysis shows 0MPO converges to an $$\\epsilon$$-approximate Nash equilibrium in $$O(\\epsilon^{-1})$$ updates. And experiments on the MT-bench-101 dataset demonstrate MPO and 0MPO's significant improvements over baselines in perceptivity, adaptability, and interactivity."

The primary weakness of this paper is noted by the authors, where the fixed and finite-horizon assumption in their framework may not be suitable for real-world conversation or reasoning process, since their steps usually differ in various situations.\n2. The experimental results are primarily validated on the MT-bench-101 dataset and a few baselines. Further experiments on diverse datasets and other base models may be necessary to establish robustness and generalizability of the proposed methods.\n3. The empirical validation relies on automatic metrics evaluated by gpt-4o. The reliance on it leaves room for uncertainty about how well the model captures nuanced human preferences in real-world scenarios. It would be better to have human evaluations on different methods when facing the same situations."

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that OMPO has a convergence rate $1/\\epsilon$ to an approximate Nash equilibrium, which is more efficient compared to existing methods.

                "value": "The authors propose an idea that is pretty close to other existing works in the literature. The main difference is that the signal used for optimization, which is the preference, is turn/state-based instead of a final preference. The authors need to better motivate why this choice is important as this is the only thing that differentiate them from the past literature and present concrete scenarios where this data can be collected from humans. Previous works have argued that they specifically choose the final preference case because human data collection is expensive and complex when humans have to provide a preference signal at each turn. Have the authors realized an experimental data collection involving humans and turn-based preference collection?\n\nThe authors present a lot of different results but most of them should already exist in the literature of online mirror descent (exemple theorem 4). I think the authors should make it clearer that those results are derived from previous ones and frame them as such in the main text. Lemma 1 is a known result and Lemma 2 should have existing variants. The derivation of the practical algorithm is also highly inspired by the IPO derivation where the Q function replaces the one-step preference (step 3-5). This should be clearly stated in the text.\n\nThe experiments need a multi-step baseline where the Q function only uses the preference at the last step to see if it is useful to have an intermediate signal. Not sure if this is the result presented in figure 1b, it was not really clear in the text. If this is the case it seems that it is not really useful to have a signal at each turn. In addition, more details on the one-step baselines such as DPO should be provided. Especially if there is masking of the user turns for DPO and why not compare it  to IPO as it seems you are using a square loss. It would make more sense to use a one-step algorithm using the same type of loss.\n\nI am willing to improve my score if:\n - The authors reframe their theoretical results by stating clearly in the main text that they derive their results from known proofs.\n - The authors provide a clear motivation of the turn-based preference signal for the LLM case and how they can build a data-collection involving humans where collecting such preferences makes sense.\n - The authors provide better baselines for their experiment such as MPO with end-signal only versus MPO with intermediary signal. Use IPO instead of DPO as it uses a squared-loss which is closer to MPO."
