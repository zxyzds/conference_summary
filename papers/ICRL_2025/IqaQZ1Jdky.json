    "abstract": "\\begin{abstract}\nNeural networks exhibit exceptional performance in processing complex data, yet their internal structures remain largely unexplored. The emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) represents a significant departure from traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast to MLPs, KANs replace fixed activation functions at nodes (``neurons\") with learnable activation functions on edges (``weights\"), enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.\nAs data evolves, the demand for models that are both flexible and robust minimizing the influence of input data variability continues to grow. Addressing this need, we propose a general framework for KANs utilizing a \\underline{\\textbf{V}}ariety \\underline{\\textbf{B}}ernstei\\underline{\\textbf{n}} Polynomial Function Basis for \\underline{\\textbf{K}}olmogorov-\\underline{\\textbf{A}}rnold \\underline{\\textbf{N}}etworks (VBn-KAN). This framework leverages the Weierstrass approximation theorem to extend function basis within KANs in theory, specifically selecting Bernstein polynomials ($B_n$) for their robustness, assured by the uniform convergence proposition. Additionally, to enhance flexibility, we implement techniques to vary the function basis $B_n$ when handling diverse datasets. Comprehensive experiments across three fields: multivariate time series forecasting, computer vision, and function approximation\u2014demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches and other variants of KANs.\n\\end{abstract}",

                "value": "The paper introduces a novel extension to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by integrating a variable Bernstein polynomial basis (VBn-KAN). The authors claim this extension enhances the flexibility and robustness of KANs in handling diverse datasets and tasks such as time series forecasting, image classification, and function approximation. While this innovation aligns with the ongoing quest for more interpretable and adaptable neural networks, its practical impact needs clearer justification.\n\nThe concept of incorporating a variable function basis, specifically using Bernstein polynomials, is intriguing and builds on established theoretical foundations like the Weierstrass approximation theorem. However, the novelty is somewhat diminished by the lack of a clear demonstration of substantial improvements over existing methods. The results show some benefits, but the advancements seem incremental rather than groundbreaking."

                "value": "1. Comparison Between Spline and Bn Polynomial in Figure 1  \nThe comparison between spline fitting and Bernstein polynomial fitting in Figure 1 is somewhat misleading. The paper mentions KANs using B-splines, not generic splines. B-splines are more flexible because their polynomial degree can be adjusted, which means a simple comparison between spline and Bn polynomial might not be fair. By default, splines are cubic, but B-splines allow for adjustable degrees, which could make the comparison with Bernstein polynomials less biased. The authors should present a more explicit comparison with B-splines of varying degrees, not just generic splines. Additionally, there is no mention of the grid resolution used for the fitting. A grid size could significantly affect the results, and this needs to be clarified for a fair comparison.\nSuggestions: 1) Explicitly compare Bernstein polynomials with B-splines of varying degrees\n2) Specify the grid resolution used for fitting\n3) Discuss how the flexibility of B-splines compares to Bernstein polynomials\n\n2. Uniform Convergence of Bn Polynomials vs. B-Splines  \nProposition 3.1 claims that Bernstein polynomials achieve uniform convergence when approximating continuous functions. However, this is not a unique property of Bernstein polynomials. B-splines also achieve uniform convergence when approximating continuous functions. The paper does not sufficiently highlight why Bernstein polynomials are a superior choice over B-splines, especially since both can achieve uniform convergence. The advantages of using Bernstein polynomials should be more clearly articulated and supported by empirical evidence.\nSuggestions: 1)Provide a comparative analysis of the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials versus B-splines\n2)Present empirical evidence demonstrating any advantages of Bernstein polynomials\n3)Explain their rationale for selecting Bernstein polynomials given the similarities with B-splines\n\n\n3. Evaluation Metrics in Table 3  \nThe paper uses ADE (Average Displacement Error) as the primary metric for function approximation in Table 3, but it is unclear why this specific metric was chosen over more standard metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). Were the results using MSE or RMSE unsatisfactory? The paper does not address this. Standard metrics are more commonly used and would make it easier to compare the results with other methods. Without this comparison, the reported performance improvements seem marginal at best, and it is difficult for the reader to grasp the significance of the results.\nSuggestions: 1)Explain their rationale for using ADE instead of more standard metrics like MSE or RMSE\n2)Provide results using MSE and RMSE in addition to ADE for easier comparison with other methods\n3)Discuss how the choice of metric impacts the interpretation of the results and the claimed performance improvements\n\n4. Interpretability and Flexibility  \nA key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a variable function basis to improve the flexibility of KANs. However, the paper does not convincingly explain how this contributes to improved interpretability in deep learning models. While the authors mention that the variable function basis allows the model to adapt to different data types, there is little discussion on how this enhances the interpretability of the model's decisions. More detailed explanations or examples illustrating the role of function basis variety in improving model interpretability would strengthen this claim.\nSuggestion: 1)Provide specific examples demonstrating how the variable function basis enhances model interpretability\n2)Discuss the relationship between model flexibility and interpretability in this context\n3)Compare the interpretability of their approach to standard KANs and other relevant models"

                "value": "* The model should not be compared on image data. The results are worse than the simplest k-NN models (99.04% on MNIST), while the inductive bias from convolutional models outperforms MLPs. The datasets chosen are mere toy models in the computer vision field at this point, and no significant improvements can be reported anymore. If the authors would show how KANs can be used for convolutional filters, this would be an entirely different story. \n * Generally, the authors should incldue results from the state of the art on the given datasets, not just compare to other KAN models. It is ok to be worse in performance than the state of the art, but the tables as they are presented in the paper suggest that the new method is \"the best\" on the datasets (including the text: l444 \"surpassing competing algorithms by substantial margins\"), while it really is just \"the best\" among the KAN methods that are being compared. It is still impressive that the variable basis can outperform the other KAN approaches, but it is misleading to not show the state of the art results. l.448: \"Overall, the VBn-KAN model consistently delivers superior or competitive results, underlining its efficacy in various image classification tasks\" is a wrong conclusion, because it is not compared to the state of the art. This fact is also not discussed at all.\n\n * The use of Bayesian optimization is not warranted in the present setting, if in equation 3.5 the only unknown parameter is \"n\" (a one-dimensional parameter?). In one dimension, MUCH faster algorithms with much better guarantees are available - e.g. a simple line search with bisection has exponentially fast convergence if the function L (Eq. 3.5) is smooth enough.\n\n * Beyond section 3.3 on \"Realization\", the authors do not explain at all how they train their KAN model. Which algorithms are used to optimize, how many data points are used, what learning rates, etc?\n\n * One of the main selling points for KAN models is \"interpretability\" (however it is defined) of the computed 1D functions. The authors do not discuss this for the computational experiments, but only focus on the uniform convergence property in general.\n\n * The use of \"variety\" is not appropriate, I believe (see my question on the topic).\n * small language errors (e.g. l.114 \"interpretabilit\")"

A mathematical variety (e.g. algebraic geometry: set of zeros of polynomial equations) is something very different to what is discussed in this section, no? Even the title of \"VBn-KAN\" includes \"Variety Bernstein Polynomial Function Basis\", where I do not understand what \"variety\" refers to. Maybe I am missing something, or the authors mean \"variability\" in a more colloquial sense? In l.287 they use \"Variable function basis\", but then switch back to l304 \"variety function basis\".\n\n * Regarding KANs in general: the authors state that (l171) \"the network contains no linear weights at all\", but then introduce weights w_b and w_s in eq. 3.2 that linearly combine spline and silu functions. Why are these not \"linear weights\"?\n\n * Figure 1 is misleading. Why are there not multiple spline functions on the left, with varying degree? This is certainly possible for splines as well - and Bernstein polynomials can also be used as splines... I do not quite understand what the authors want to illustrate here."
