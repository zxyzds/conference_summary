    "abstract": "We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7\u20130.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000\u00d7 compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The primary comparison is with AIMD simulations and MLIP, which are used to generate the data. The paper does not compare LIFLOW to existing machine learning-based approaches for MD acceleration, such as GNN-based models [1, 2], diffusion models [3], variational approaches [4] or normalizing flows [5]. Inclusion of such comparisons would greatly improve the credibility of the claims of ths work.\n\nWhile the model is shown to work well on lithium SSEs, there is limited discussion on generalizing LIFLOW to other types of materials or chemical systems. This could restrict the perceived impact of the method. An additional showcase on different datasets, such as MD17 [6] and OC20 [7] could further shine light on the model's generalization. \n\nThe model struggles with extrapolating to conditions outside the training regime, such as lower temperatures, where rare events are poorly captured. This suggests potential limitations in scenarios requiring greater generalization. Considering well know enhancement approaches, such as physics informed neural networks for the loss function modification or active learning to sample when rare events occur can be benificial.   \n\nThe model relies on several hyperparameters, such as the prior scale, that require careful tuning, which could impact its ease of use and robustness. While the authors acknowledge this issue and discuss the need for a more principled method for prior design, further improvements could be explored. Specifically, I suggest that the authors discuss any sensitivity analyses they performed to understand the impact of these hyperparameters on model performance. This could provide insights into the stability and reliability of the model across a range of settings. Additionally, the authors might consider implementing automated hyperparameter tuning methods, such as Bayesian optimization or hyperparameter sweeps, to alleviate the need for manual tuning. Such techniques could enhance the model's usability and reduce the dependency on empirical parameter selection. Finally, exploring the integration of adaptive or learnable priors might offer a more dynamic approach, allowing the model to adjust parameters in response to varying data conditions automatically.\n\nSome of the modifications to the PaiNN [8] architecture, such as the integration of equivariant flow fields and the use of a Maxwell-Boltzmann prior distribution, appear to be necessary adjustments rather than novel contributions. These changes are essential to adapt PaiNN into a flow-based model while preserving physical symmetries and ensuring accurate molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, given that similar flow matching techniques have been applied in related work (as discussed in previous papers, such as [9, 10, 11]), the degree of novelty in these architectural modifications may be limited, as they are fundamental requirements for the chosen modeling approach rather than unique innovations. Furthermore, these modifications likely contribute to increased computational costs compared to the original PaiNN architecture, which may limit the model\u2019s efficiency and scalability in large-scale simulations, even if performance is improved for the experiments at hand.\n\nThe paper's readability could be significantly improved, as the current structure and presentation make it challenging to follow. Enhancing the flow of the text and providing clearer explanations would greatly benefit readers and better convey the complexity of the work. Location of Table 1 and Table 2 distrupts the flow. Specifically, I suggest reorganizing the sections for better coherence. Large-scale inference and computational costs can be subsection intead of bolds. Additionally, the discussions on the effect of hyperparameters like P and C, as well as the choice of prior, could be moved to the Ablation Studies section following the main experimental results. Each dataset and its results given as 4.2 and 4.3 but it is very hard to pinpoint the results. I think 'effect of prior study' and 'case study'  is where you share results for 4.2. These can be created into a subsetion as 'Results for Universal Model' or something. 'Reproducing kinetic properties' and 'Reproducing structural features' is where you share your results for 4.3, which can also benefit from similar fashion. Figure 2 and Figure 3 can be merge into one figure which spans 2 columns. A figure of the proposed model can be shared in addition to the scheme. I believe these or similar changes would streamline the narrative and make it easier for readers to understand the work and its effect. Initial sentece in the introduction needs a reference as well as the 'Crystalline materials and representation' subsection. 'REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT' is given in 11th page.\n\n[1] Liao, Y.

                "value": "1) Why authors did not include comparisons with other ML-based MD acceleration methods, such as GNNs, diffusion, variational autoencoders, and normalizing flows. For a fair effectiveness of the model, some of the state-of-the-art ML approaches could have been implemented [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\n2) Can LIFLOW be easily adapted to simulate other materials beyond lithium-based SSEs? If so, what modifications would be necessary? For example, can you apply this model to MD17 [6], OC20 [7], or Ani-1x [8] dataset and show its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art?\n\n3) The model relies on several hyperparameters, such as the prior scale, that require careful tuning, potentially impacting its ease of use and robustness. While you acknowledge the need for a more principled method for prior design, did you perform any sensitivity analyses to understand how these hyperparameters affect model performance and stability? Additionally, have you considered implementing automated hyperparameter tuning techniques, like Bayesian optimization or hyperparameter sweeps, to minimize the reliance on manual tuning? Finally, do you see potential benefits in exploring adaptive or learnable priors that could dynamically adjust based on data conditions, and if so, how might this improve the model\u2019s performance and generalizability?\n\n4) Authors mention the risk of generating physically fictitious dynamics. Are there ways to quantify or mitigate this risk more systematically?\n\n5) Amorphous materials often exhibit complex atomic transport mechanisms due to their lack of long-range order [9]. How well would LIFLOW generalize to amorphous systems, and have you considered testing the model on amorphous materials such as amorphous silicon or lithium-phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) electrolytes [10]? If not, what challenges do you foresee in applying your approach to such systems, and how might the model be adapted to handle the inherent structural disorder?\n\n6) In Section 3.2.1, you provide a comprehensive explanation of how your model ensures invariance to various symmetries, including permutation, translation, and rotation. Given the complexities involved in modeling these symmetries, did you encounter any specific challenges or limitations when implementing these equivariant properties, particularly for higher-order interactions or rare configurations? Additionally, do you believe that incorporating more advanced equivariant architectures (e.g., equivariant graph attention [1]) could further improve the performance or generalizability of your approach?\n\n7) The modifications you made to the PaiNN architecture,  such as integrating equivariant flow fields and using a Maxwell-Boltzmann prior, seem necessary for adapting PaiNN into a flow-based framework that preserves physical symmetries. Given that these changes are essential for the model's operation and that flow matching techniques have been previously applied in related contexts (as seen in [11, 12, 13]), do you consider your approach to be a novel contribution, or do you view it as an adaptation of existing methods for this specific application? Furthermore, how do these modifications impact the computational cost compared to the original PaiNN architecture? Does the accuracy gained with the changes still overshadows the computational cost for the larger simulations?\n\n\n[1] Liao, Y. L., & Smidt, T. (2022).

Why not compute something like MAE of estimated positions across the whole trajectory?\n* The authors should have made more effort to make the presentation compact enough to fit on 9-10 pages without having to refer to appendix figures. All the material up to the references technically takes up more than 10 pages. As an example of excessive reliance on appendix material, an entire subsection (lines 455-466) refers only to appendix figures."

Why not make it a one-step conditional generative model instead of an entire flow? Have you tried reducing the number of flow steps to 1 for the corrector?\n\nSuggestions:\n* Line 71 mentions a \u201clattice matrix.\u201d It would help to describe what this is intuitively for someone unfamiliar with the field.\n* In the footnote on line 107, should the $t$ be a $\\tau$?\n* Line 230 defines a $\\sigma_\\mathcal{S}$ variable that does not appear in Equation 10 above.\n* The language in lines 331-332 makes it sound like the MSD is computed *between* configurations and not for a single configuration.\n* It\u2019s hard to tell what the purpose of Table 3 is, and it\u2019s not explained much in the text. What are these results supposed to convey about your method?"

This paper also discussed Li-ion diffusion.\n\n* The idea of two sets edge in the conditional GNN network was previously employed in (Hsu et al 2024).\n\n* The physics-inspired prior was, as the authors admitted, employed previously.\n\n* The results were good as proof-of-concept, but not practically useful enough."

A closely related paper, Fu et al 2023, already studied surrogate models based on the diffusion model for Li-ion electrolyte. In their response to this review, the authors are advised to compare more carefully to that paper and show that they are offering something better.\n\n* Please consider explaining how the work compares to TimeWarp and F3LOW.\n\n* Please cite Arts et al 2023, \"Two for one ...\".\n\n* Overall, I find it hard to accept it as a method development paper to ICLR.
