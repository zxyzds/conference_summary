                "value": "The paper introduces the Local Euler Characteristic Transform (L-ECT), an extension of the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) designed for graph representation learning. Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can obscure local details through node aggregation, the L-ECT maintains local structural data, thus enhancing interpretability and performance, especially in heterogeneous (high heterophily) graphs. By capturing spatial and structural characteristics of local neighborhoods, the L-ECT provides a rotation-invariant metric for data alignment, showcasing improved performance over GNNs in node classification tasks. The method\u2019s compatibility with machine learning models enables use cases beyond standard GNN architectures, offering more accessible and interpretable models, such as tree-based classifiers. Empirical results demonstrate that L-ECT outperforms GNNs in heterogeneous datasets and facilitates robust spatial alignment in both synthetic and high-dimensional data. This research suggests future exploration into scaling L-ECT and integrating global and local information in complex graph structures."

This novel transformation preserves intricate topological information, allowing for more nuanced node representations by capturing both structural and spatial data and offering an alternative to GNN message-passing frameworks. Additionally, the authors introduce a rotation-invariant metric that enables robust spatial alignment of data in Euclidean space, enhancing the method\u2019s applicability in graph-structured data and increasing resilience to coordinate transformations. Empirical results underscore L-ECT\u2019s effectiveness, showing superior performance over standard GNNs in high-heterophily datasets like WebKB, Roman Empire, and Amazon Ratings. Furthermore, L-ECT\u2019s model-agnostic nature facilitates integration with interpretable machine learning models, such as XGBoost, making it ideal for use in regulated fields like healthcare and finance where transparency is paramount. Beyond graph representation, L-ECT extends to point clouds and other high-dimensional data, proving robust to noise and outliers and enabling efficient spatial alignment without the need for exhaustive pairwise distance computations.\n\nThe methods section is detailed yet readable, presenting L-ECT\u2019s mathematical foundation and integrating a rotation-invariant metric for spatial alignment, which adds to the paper\u2019s originality. While the experiments section is robust and results are well-presented through tables and figures, additional visual aids could further clarify data characteristics and enhance accessibility.\n\nthe discussion on the limitations of the approaches proposed in the paper is appreciated"

                "value": "The paper would benefit, both in making more persuasive the novelty of the work with respect to contemporary literature as well as clarity of the work itself, with a more robust background and related works section \n\nIncluding a more robust and explicit comparison to related works, which also addresses the novelty of the work being proposed, would be appreciated.\n\nThe L-ECT approach, while innovative, faces several limitations and lacks certain aspects of novelty. Its computational complexity scales with graph size and density, making it less efficient for very large or dense graphs and primarily feasible for medium-sized datasets. Although L-ECT emphasizes local information preservation, similar topology-aware or geometric GNN approaches also capture neighborhood-specific details, reducing the uniqueness of this feature. Additionally, traditional GNNs perform comparably well on low-heterophily datasets, indicating that L-ECT may not consistently outperform them across all types of graph data. The approach\u2019s scalability is further limited by sampling trade-offs, as its accuracy depends on carefully chosen parameters, such as direction and filtration steps, which challenge fidelity and computational efficiency at scale. Moreover, despite its model-agnostic design, L-ECT\u2019s interpretability hinges on pre-defined features, potentially restricting its flexibility for complex, dynamic graphs. Finally, L-ECT does not support end-to-end learning as GNNs do; instead, it relies on external classifiers (e.g., XGBoost), which may limit its integration into more comprehensive, end-to-end pipelines.\n\nThe authors should include comparison other works which construct topological representations of graphs and graphs neighborhoods and include reference to those related methods such as \u201cgraph filtration learning\u201d by Hofer et. al. and other approaches as discussed in survey works such as  \u201cA Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods\u201d by Hensel et. al.\n\nThe authors provide comparative experimental analysis to a number of datasets.

                "value": "1. **Limited Applicability:** The proposed approach is constrained to graphs with node feature vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, limiting its applicability to datasets that fit this specific structure.\n\n2. **Effectiveness of Approach:** While the concept of embedding the graph into an attribute space using node attribute vectors is promising, the subsequent steps for extracting meaningful information appear less effective. The method could be enhanced by exploring simpler and more efficient ways to utilize the geometry (rather than topology) of ego networks induced within the attribute space.\n\n3. **Feasibility in High Dimensions:** As the dimension $n$ of the feature space increases, the number $m$ of representative vectors on $S^{n-1}$ must grow nearly exponentially. Furthermore, the feature vector range impacts the number of intervals {$t_i$} needed. For high-dimensional and wide-range data, this results in a very high-dimensional $l$-ECT vector, making the approach impractical for real-world applications. Dimension reduction could help by reducing feature dimensionality to three (as two dimensions may be insufficient for graph embedding) and normalizing feature vectors (e.g. total diameter of feature vector space to 2), allowing for \"end-to-end\" a fixed-size feature extraction for nodes. Without this, selecting vectors and thresholds can be challenging, particularly for new users.\n\n4. **Theoretical Contributions vs. Practical Applications:** While the rotation-invariant metric is mathematically appealing, it may lack practical relevance since it relies on the infimum over all rotations. Also, the discussion of graph isomorphism seems tangential, as Definition 2 is highly restrictive, applicable only to isomorphic graphs with identical feature vectors.\n\n5. **Experimental Results:** The presented results are uninformative and potentially misleading. The models used, GCN and GAT, are older and are known to perform poorly in heterophilic settings. The authors should consider comparing their approach with newer GNN models that perform well on heterophilic datasets and include more homophilic datasets (other than Computers and Photo) to provide a comprehensive performance assessment. Also, exploring the integration of $l$-ECT vectors with a more recent GNN model may yield interesting insights into performance enhancement."

However, I don't think this is a genuine embedding. For example, if the feature space is \\mathbb{R}^2, then even if the nodes are embedded to the place in a 1-1 fashion, the edges may cross each other. Therefore, only talking about vertex embedding is insufficient as a graph or a simplicial complex has additional structures. \n2. Related to 1. The author should be more specific on ``embedding'', whether it is metrical embedding, differential embedding, or topological embedding (or something else?). \n3. The proofs are poorly written. The statements are vague and imprecise. Many details are missing. It is hard to assess the correctness of the results. \n4. It seems to me that the proposed l-ECTs capture local structural information. They are used as node features, but not used to guide feature aggregation. I fail to get the intuition of why they can be useful for the node classification task. However, on the other hand, they might be useful for the graph classification task. \n5. The compared benchmarks are very limited (only GCN and GAT). From my own experience, the results are not very impressive, e.g., for the Actor, Squirrel, and Chameleon datasets, there are more recent benchmarks (e.g., ACM-GCN) whose performance is at least 5%-10% higher than those reported by the authors. \n6. Ablation study is missing. It is hard to assess whether l-ECTs play an important role in the reults shown."
