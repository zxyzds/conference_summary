    "title": "The Phase Transition Phenomenon of Shuffled Regression",
    "abstract": "We study the phase transition \nphenomenon inherent in the shuffled (permuted) regression problem, which has found numerous applications in databases, privacy, data analysis, etc. For the permuted regression task: $\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{\\Pi}\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{B}$, the goal is to recover the permutation matrix $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$ as well as the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{B}$. It has been empirically observed in prior studies that when recovering $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$, there exists a phase transition phenomenon: the error rate drops to zero rapidly once the parameters reach certain thresholds. In this study, we aim to precisely identify the locations of the phase transition points by leveraging techniques from {\\em message passing} (MP). \n\nIn our analysis, we first transform the permutation recovery problem into a probabilistic graphical model. Then, we leverage the analytical tools rooted in the message passing (MP) algorithm and derive an equation to track the convergence of the MP algorithm. By linking this equation to the branching random walk process, we are able to characterize the impact of the \\emph{signal-to-noise-ratio} ($\\mathsf{snr}$) on the permutation recovery.  Depending on whether the signal is given or not, we separately investigate the oracle case and the non-oracle case. The bottleneck in identifying the phase transition regimes lies in deriving closed-form formulas for the corresponding critical points, but only in rare scenarios can one obtain such precise expressions. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Gaussian approximation method, which allows us to obtain the closed-form formulas in almost all scenarios. In the oracle case, our method can fairly accurately predict the phase transition $\\mathsf{snr}$. In the non-oracle case, our proposed algorithm can predict the maximum allowed number of permuted rows and uncover its dependency on the sample number.",

If I understood you correctly, the correlations should be weak (it is a conclusion from the experiments), but they are almost always nonzero. These weak correlations should lead to some additional terms that should be vanishing, and showing that they are vanishing is complicated, that's why you just assumed that they are zero, is it correct?"

                "value": "Then, let us address your concerns. \n\n(1) First, we would like to clarify that **conducting our analysis within the message-passing (MP) framework does not diminish the technical novelty of our work**. \n\nMP serves as an analytical tool, much like concentration inequalities. Conducting analysis within the framework of MP is like giving analysis with concentration inequalities, which we hardly think downgrade the technical novelty. Determining the phase transition point of a specific group of message passing equations requires careful and intricate analysis. \n\nFurthermore, numerous papers adopting similar methodologies, or inherently related approaches (such as the replica method), have been published in leading machine learning conferences/journals. A few examples are listed in below.\n\n[Construction of optimal spectral methods in phase retrieval](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v145/maillard22a/maillard22a.pdf)\n\n[Stochasticity helps to navigate rough landscapes: comparing gradient-descent-based algorithms in the phase retrieval problem\n](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac0615/pdf)\n\n[Spectral redemption in clustering sparse networks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1312486110)\n\n[Probabilistic reconstruction in compressed sensing: algorithms, phase diagrams, and threshold achieving matrices](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2012/08/P08009/meta)\n\n[Optimal errors and phase transitions in high-dimensional generalized linear models\n](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1802705116)\n\n[Mutual information for symmetric rank-one matrix estimation: A proof of the replica formula\n](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/file/621bf66ddb7c962aa0d22ac97d69b793-Paper.pdf)\n\n[Short-term memory in neuronal networks through dynamical compressed sensing](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2010/file/0f2c9a93eea6f38fabb3acb1c31488c6-Paper.pdf)\n\n(2) Second, we would like to confirm you that Proposition 1 is derived rigorously under the Assumption 1. \n\n(3) As for your concern regarding to the presentation clarity, we really appreciate it if you could provide more details.  For your convenience, we would like to give a brief roadmap of our results. \n\nSection 3 is about the oracle case, Section 3.1 derives the phase transition by directly analyzing the RV $\\Xi$, and Section 3.2 proposes to approximate $\\Xi$ with Gaussian approximation, which is easier to compute and more general. \n\nSection 4 concerns the non-oracle case, which calculates the phase transition point based on the Gaussian approximation. \nProposition 3 concerns the position of the phase transition while Theorem 3 calculates the associated quantities. \n\nIn the end, please feel free to let us know if you have any questions."

                "value": "First, we would like to thank you for your feedback. Before we answer your concern, we would like to first discuss the advancement of our approach. \n\n1. **Our work shows noticeable advantage over the work in the same field**. One example is [Lufkin et al. 2024], which was released this Feburary from several renowned statistists. It considers a similar but simpler setting of our paper $(m=1)$. A conjectured (c.f. the phase transition happens at $snr = n^{4/m}$ on the oracle case)  that they mention as an open problem can be easily derived by us, c.f. Line 372-374. In fact, we treat them as a warm-up example. Other advantages include 1) our work can predict the precise phase transition point; 2) our applicability to a wider class of cases; and 3) our consolidation into a cohesive framework to predict the phase transition point. More details can be found in Remark 4. \n\n2. **Our work can predict the phase transition in a rather accurate way**. The numerical experiments show that differences between the predicted value and our predictions are under 0.001 in some cases. Meanwhile, previous works in the permuted linear regression only consider the logarithmic value (c.f. \u00a0Pananjady et al., 2018; Slawski & Ben-David, 2019; Pananjady et al., 2017; Slawski et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020), that is, only checks\u00a0the order of magnitude."

Pananjady et al., 2018; Slawski & Ben-David, 2019; Pananjady et al., 2017; Slawski et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020) suggests that **the structure of the B matrix barely has any impact on the phase transition point**, including the  [Lufkin et al., 2024] that also targets on the precise location of the phase transition point. \n\nIn fact, the SNR and the stable rank of $B$ play the dominant role. This is also suggested in our result. \n\nIn summary, we have already verified Assumption 1 with the following three ways: \n\n1. Our numerical experiments on multiple matrices show good alignment between the numerical values and the predicted values. \n2. Our prediction results agree with the previous rigorously derived result, that is, the SNR and the stable rank determines the phase transition point. \n3. Our prediction results agrees with the conjecture in [Lufkin et al., 2024], which consider the same problem but under a much simpler setting, \n\nWe hope this can address your concern over our assumption 1 and please feel free to let us know if you have questions on other issues."

We conduct experiments on almost all the typical matrices, including both deterministic (c.f. Table 1 and 2) and Gaussian random matrices and other matrices. We do not find any matrices will lead to significant divergence between our predicted results and the numerical results. A detailed description of the B matrix can be found in our paper. \n\nWe will be happy to add new experiments on the matrices you would like to try."

I said that assumptions should be mathematically correct and they should be true for some non-trivial classes of inputs, and some examples of such classes should be provided. Can you name some classes of $B$ that satisfy this assumption? (e.g. low rank, or sparse, or some other properties that can be fully described in terms of $B$, preferably with an easy description). When you do it, we can say that you proof works for these classes, but we cannot formally say anything about other $B$. You can say then that experiments suggest that for many other $B$ the result should also be true, that is fine and good for future works. The strength of you result then would mainly depend on the specific classes of $B$ for which assumption 1 is satisfied, and for some other classes of $B$ you can formulate a relevant conjecture based on the experiments."

                "value": "In addition, we respectfully disagree with some of your suggestions. A few points raised appear somewhat confusing and might even suggest some degree of bias. We hope to clarify these aspects further.\n\nFirst, you suggest that in learning theory community, `you have to assume some nice properties of B (or other parameters of the problem), and then rigorously derive some result.` In particular, we are very confused about your suggestion such that we should not justify our assumptions by numerical experiments. \n\nWe regard **the theory needs to be aligned with the numerical experiments but not vice versa**. A theory that appears elegant but fails to align with experiments lacks any practical value. \n\nAs you can see, **our numerical experiments (Table 1 and 2) align with the numerical experiments to a very good extent, with differences under 0.001 in some cases**. Meanwhile, notice that all the previous works in the permuted linear regression only considers the logarithmic value (c.f. \u00a0Pananjady et al., 2018; Slawski & Ben-David, 2019; Pananjady et al., 2017; Slawski et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020), that is,\u00a0**the order of magnitude**. \n\nSecond, we are confused by your comment `our result only contain equalities (approximate equalities up to\u00a0o(1)\u00a0terms) suggest the approach are not very sophisticated`. As you noted, the goal of asymptotic analysis is to identify expressions that approximate complex behavior in the limit. Almost all the asymptotic analysis are of a similar look.\n\nWhile we do not view sophistication as a primary objective, we hope our analysis, which spans over 40 pages, demonstrates a thorough approach that goes beyond simple equivalence transformations.  \n\nIn the end, we are happy to assist you in understanding our paper and address your questions regarding the technical or whatever questions you have."

We appreciate your suggestion regarding assumptions on some nice properties of B (or other parameters of the problem). However, our approach does not require us to impose such assumptions, allowing us to work under more general conditions.\n\nSecond, Assumption 1 is to meet the i.i.d conditions in Theorem 1.

Currently it is unclear to me whether there is any non-trivial matrix B that satisfies this assumption. Is it the case that you used this assumption in your formal proofs? Also, is it correct that your result formally answers the question from [Lufkin et al., 2024] only under this assumption?\n\nIn addition, your proofs seem to contain only equalities (or approximate equalities up to $o(1)$ terms). While this complaint might sound weird, it indicates that the approach may not be very sophisticated. You basically just do equivalent transformations of formulas. While potentially sometimes it might be non-trivial, practically almost always it is not the case. So far it seems to me that your assumption 1 is needed exactly for these equivalent transformations to work, and with any mathematically correct assumption the analysis has to become significantly more challenging.\n\nGiven these two observations, I recommend rejecting the paper."
