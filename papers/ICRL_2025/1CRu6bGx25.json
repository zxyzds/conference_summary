    "title": "Crack in the Armor: Universal Stability Measurement for Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have become essential to general artificial intelligence, demonstrating impressive capabilities in task understanding and problem-solving. The real-world functionality of these large models critically depends on their stability. However, there is still a lack of rigorous studies examining the stability of LLMs when subjected to various perturbations. \nIn this paper, we aim to address this gap by proposing a novel influence measure for LLMs. This measure is inspired by statistical methods grounded in information geometry, offering desirable invariance properties. Using this framework, we analyze the sensitivity of LLMs in response to parameter or input perturbations. \nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on models of varying sizes, from 1.5B to 13B parameters. The results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our measure in identifying salient parameters and pinpointing vulnerable areas of input images that dominate model outcomes. Our research not only enhances the understanding of LLM sensitivity but also highlights the broad potential of our influence measure in optimizing models for tasks such as model quantization and model merging.",

I am open to changing my mind,  but I strongly encourage the authors to focus on those specific points in their response and be very clear how their method differs from existing works.\n\nNovelty of the method: Not clear how the proposed method is different from other analysis methods such as Saliancy maps [1] and            adversarial perturbations. A throughout analysis of the related methods should be presented and compared against in the paper.\n\nComparison with the baselines: Several compelling applications of the method are proposed, but no comparison to existing baseline methods tacking these applications. The authors should consider comparing the presented method against relevant baselines on standard benchmarks so that the reader can assess the usefulness of the method.\n\nClarity of the paper: I found the paper to be hard to follow. The paper introduces unnecessarily abstracts notions to describe the method. I   don't understand why such abstraction is needed to describe the idea presented in the paper. Moreover, a lot of terms a unnecessarily defined. For example,  $l(\\omega|y,x,theta)$ could be written as $\\log P(y|x,\\theta,\\omega)$ and $f(\\omega)$ as $-P(y_\\text{pred}|x,\\theta,\\omega$ and it would make the reading clearer. Some terms like $h_j$ are not clearly defined.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034"

Furthermore, the authors test their approach with respect to input parameters by identifying crucial parameters that should be left intact during quantization, and validating that performance deteriorates less when they're not changed."
