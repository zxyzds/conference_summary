    "title": "Can Decoding by Contrasting Layers Really Improve Factuality in Large Language Models?",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made notable advancements across diverse applications,  but their susceptibility to  hallucinations remains a critical challenge. That is, they could produce outputs  divergent from real-world evidence or user-provided inputs. Recent studies have explored a contrastive decoding strategy known as DoLa, which mitigates output inaccuracy by contrasting the outputs from the final layer against those from the previous layers.  Nevertheless, such strategy has its limitation, as LLMs, which already have internalized extensive parametric knowledge through comprehensive pre-training and fine-tuning phases, may generate errors due to incorrect or obsolete information within their parameters.  As an alternative,  trusted external knowledge could be included in the prompt context for querying,  but the constrained context window of LLMs poses a significant barrier restricting the amount of information that can be provided. \nTo address the above issues,  we propose to integrate the contrasive decoding strategy with a long-context encoder that effectively condenses extensive initial contexts into a more concise format.  Extensive experiments have demonstrated that, \nour proposed methodology enhances the factual accuracy of the produced content, \nwhen applied to various datasets. For instance, it has improved the performance of LLaMA2-7B models on the Quality dataset by 61.61\\%, compared to the DoLa decoding method, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of LLMs in generating truthful information.",

The contribution of this work lies in showing that compression with contrastive decoding enhances performances and that adaptive decoding mechanisms may be suboptimal. However, simply combining compression techniques with DoLa lacks sufficient novelty, making the approach more incremental.\n\n- Insufficient analysis. While the study finds adaptive decoding ineffective, it doesn't thoroughly explore why this is the case. Additionally, it lacks analysis of what information context compression actually preserves or whether it introduces unintended side effects(e.g. lossing , . Importantly, it overlooks scenarios where external knowledge might be inaccurate or irrelevant, limiting insights into robustness of the proposed methods under real applications.\n\n\n- Lack of comparison with other compression methods. The paper does not compare its compression approach with alternative techniques. A broader comparison would clarify the advantages and limitations of this method within the wider context of existing research."

                "value": "- The title is very misleading: \"Can Decoding by Contrasting Layers Really Improve Factuality in Large Language Models?\" --> It seems that you are trying to challenge the idea of DoLa? But in fact, the content of this paper is not like this at all. This paper is extending DoLa to the long-context setting finding DoLa's limitation in long-context, and trying to add some new methods based on / relying on DoLa. In this title, I don't even see the phrase related to \"long-context\" at all but it's exactly the main topic of this paper. The title is very inappropriate and misleading. It seems just for eye-catching purposes. I cannot accept this paper unless the title is changed. A good title can be something like \"Exploring the Limits of Decoding by Contrasting Layers for Long-Context Factuality in Large Language Models\"\n\n- Adding a long-context encoder seems to have nothing to do with DoLa at all: DoLa focuses on short-length QA tasks from the beginning. Not sure how this would be a good motivation.\n\n- Figure 1 is also misleading. The DoLa method doesn\u2019t include any context encoder, but the figure shows that the context encoder is part of DoLa, which is not true. You should add a title to the figure such as \u201cContext Encoder + DoLa\u201d\n\n- According to section 3.3, your method will dynamically choose 1) Context Encoder + DoLa 2) Context Encoder + Normal Decoding. If it\u2019s true, then the figure 1 is even more misleading. The caption says the left subfigure is DoLa and the right figure is the proposed method, but the real proposed method actually includes both left and right?\n\n- Some of the math equations or definitions seem redundant, for example, in line 150, the authors defined $V_m$ as the middle layer output but never used it.\n\n- Section 3.2 is PEFT specifically for context compression encoder, the title of the section should better be \u201cParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning for Context Encoder\u201d\n\n- In Section 3.2, you define the symbol $Q$ as the query vector. However, in Section 3.3, the $Q$ here seems to be the output distribution of early exits, e.g. $Q_L$, $Q_M$, $Q_j$ from $L$, $M$, $j$-th layers, as the query vector cannot compute any JS-divergence. Please define $Q$ properly.\n\n- In Table 1, the row names seem too arbitrary: some include LLaMA-2-7B while some do not; the proposed method seems to have 128K ctx size but the name shows 4k, e.g. 4k Ours (non-adaptive). I am pretty confused about what these row names mean here."

This strategy opts for contrastive decoding only when LM shows uncertainty in predicting the next token, which assumes that contrastive decoding will yield a more accurate prediction in these cases. However, this raises the question: if the authors believe contrastive decoding is generally more effective, why not apply it consistently instead of implementing an adaptive approach? The results of varying the hyperparameter $\\tau$ confirm that such an adaptive strategy is necessary, as always using contrastive decoding reaches the best performance.\n2. Considering that the adaptive strategy is not that effective, the novelty of this paper seems limited. It seems primarily to apply AutoCompressor to compress long contexts for LMs, rather than presenting a fundamentally new approach (correct me if I\u2019m wrong)."
