    "title": "3DMolFormer: A Dual-channel Framework for Structure-based Drug Discovery",
    "abstract": "Structure-based drug discovery, encompassing the tasks of protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, represents a core challenge in drug discovery. However, no existing work can deal with both tasks to effectively leverage the duality between them, and current methods for each task are hindered by challenges in modeling 3D information and the limitations of available data. To address these issues, we propose 3DMolFormer, a unified dual-channel transformer-based framework applicable to both docking and 3D drug design tasks, which exploits their duality by utilizing docking functionalities within the drug design process. Specifically, we represent 3D pocket-ligand complexes using parallel sequences of discrete tokens and continuous numbers, and we design a corresponding dual-channel transformer model to handle this format, thereby overcoming the challenges of 3D information modeling. Additionally, we alleviate data limitations through large-scale pre-training on a mixed dataset, followed by supervised and reinforcement learning fine-tuning techniques respectively tailored for the two tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DMolFormer outperforms previous approaches in both protein-ligand docking and pocket-aware 3D drug design, highlighting its promising application in structure-based drug discovery.",

                "value": "This paper introduces 3DMolFormer, a unified transformer-based framework for SBDD, which is capable of docking prediction and pocket-aware 3D drug design. The motivations of 3DMolFormer are clearly stated: current computational docking methods lack accuracy, while current 3D pocket aware drug design methods are unable to take full advantage of 3D structural information due to factors such as difficulties in 3D information modelling and limited data regarding ground-truth protein-ligand complexes. To represent a 3D complex of a protein pocket and a small molecule ligand, 3DMolFormer uses a parallel sequence composed of the SMILES atom token sequences for the protein and small molecule, along with the numerical sequence for 3D coordinates. A GPT architecture is pretrained through autoregressive generation of the parallel sequence. Fine-tuning consists of: (1) a supervised protein-ligand binding pose prediction task, and (2) a multi-objective RL pocket-aware molecular generation task. The presented results suggest that 3DMolFormer is successful in both fine-tuning tasks; it accurately predicts binding poses of ligands to protein pockets, and is capable of generating molecules that display high binding affinity to protein targets, while being synthesizable and exhibiting drug-like qualities."

I think this aspect warrants further discussion and consideration. Although the experiments validate the method's effectiveness to some extent, I believe the persuasive power of these findings is limited when considering the following points:\n1. For docking task, as far as I know, the more advanced approach Uimol-docking v2 is not included in the baslines.\n2. For sbdd task, I noticed that the article directly employs evaluation metrics (Vina QED SA) as the reward function and utilizes reinforcement learning for fine-tuning. This approach may be considered unfair to other methods.  It may be necessary to incorporate abalation study as well as additional evaluation methods to comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the approach, for example, the delta score proposed in paper [1] may serve as a metric for assessing whether the method is overfitting to the Vina evaluation.\n\n\n[1].

Is there a mistake, or are they using a different metric? I noticed that further clarification is provided in the Appendix.\n\nMulti-score Thresholds.
