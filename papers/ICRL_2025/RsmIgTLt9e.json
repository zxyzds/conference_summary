    "title": "Preserving the Unique Heritage of Chinese Ancient Architecture in Diffusion Models with Text and Image Integration",
    "abstract": "Leveraging the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models, we can create diverse images from imaginative prompts with careful design. To be noticed, the key components, such as CLIP, are essential for aligning prompts with image representations. However, these models often underperform in specialized areas, like the Chinese ancient architecture. One of the important reasons is that historical buildings include not only architectural information, but also historical and cultural content. The preservation and integration of these unique characteristics has become a significant challenge in model expansion. In this paper, we propose an Image-Annotation-Augmented Diffusion pipeline combining human feedback to explore the specific-area paradigm for image generation in the context of small amounts of data and professional concepts. We first leverage Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to obtain a refined content image to enable an in-depth analysis of the relationship between unique characteristics and multimodal image generation models, and reselected representative images and regrouped them according to their distinctive objective and the existing dataset. Then, we introduce the effective RAG and GraphRAG module to identify the complex structure of relationships among different entities in the training and inference stages respectively. Based on the initial text by BLIP3, the RAG instructs GPT4 to facilitate more accurate, content-aware annotations during training, and augment a high-quality object prompt using the GraphRAG during inference. Benefit from these outstanding models and architectures, we train fine-tuning models to showcase the enhanced performance of our proposed pipeline compared to other existing models. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline effectively preserves and integrates the unique characteristics of ancient Chinese architecture.",
