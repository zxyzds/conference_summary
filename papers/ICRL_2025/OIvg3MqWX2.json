    "title": "A Theoretically-Principled Sparse, Connected, and Rigid Graph Representation of Molecules",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) -- learn graph representations by exploiting graph's sparsity, connectivity, and symmetries -- have become indispensable for learning geometric data like molecules. However, the most used graphs (e.g., radial cutoff graphs) in molecular modeling lack theoretical guarantees for achieving connectivity and sparsity simultaneously, which are essential for the performance and scalability of GNNs. Furthermore, existing widely used graph construction methods for molecules lack rigidity, limiting GNNs' ability to exploit graph nodes' spatial arrangement. In this paper, we introduce a new hyperparameter-free graph construction of molecules and beyond with sparsity, connectivity, and rigidity guarantees. Remarkably, our method consistently generates connected and sparse graphs with the edge-to-node ratio being bounded above by 3. Our graphs' rigidity guarantees that edge distances and dihedral angles are sufficient to uniquely determine general spatial arrangements of atoms. We substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed graphs in various molecular modeling benchmarks.",

                "value": "The present manuscript proposes a novel graph construction method, SCHull for molecular modeling thorugh GNNs. The authors start by introducing limitations of the currently existing graph construction  methods (e.g. radial cuttoff, and knn graphs), that cannot deal with sparsity, connectivity, and rigidity at the same time.\n\nThe method constructs graphs in two steps, first by projecting points onto the unit sphere. and secondly by constructing a convex hull for the projected points, and adding edges to the graph, based on the convex hull. According to the authors' motivation, the resulting graphs are sparse, connected, and rigid, making them suitable for learning molecular representations using GNNs.\n\nThe authors show the impact of SCHull, by integrating it into current molecular Gnns, and test it in various benchmarks, including MD17, as well as protein modeling tasks (fold, enzyme reaction classification, Protein-ligand binding)."

In general, the authors provide a well-defined set of propositions for defining connectivity, rigidity, and sparsity for the SChull graphs, making it useful for predicting their impact on GNN's performance and scalability.\n\n2. The motivation for a hyper-parameter free approach for graph construction is very intriguing, and can be proven very useful for molecular modeling tasks, where the distance thresholds can play an important role. \n\n3. The empirical results show that in both small- and large-molecular modeling tasks, SChull has a positive impact in a couple of GNNs. \n\n4. The paper is well-written, the formulations are clear, and the experimentation setup is nicely described.\n\n5. It's very interesting that Tables 4, and 5 show a comparable increase of the runtime cost, with respect to the methods without the SChull. I would expect a much longer runtime discrepancy, due to the point projection, and the CH computation.\n\n5. The code is available, seemingly containing all variants of models and benchmarks appeared in the manuscript. I cannot assess its validity, as I did not run it."

An approach on learning new geometric interactions might be useful in better interpreting the correlation of geometry and function, which could be particularly a motivation for this paper. The paper should focus on exploring or at least mention how such a convex hull approach, despite a comparable computational cost can help on finding interpretable structures.\n\n3. Since the method is focusing on the three properties of sparsity, connectivity, and rigidity, it'd be great if the authors can show empirically the impact of SChull on each of these properties independently. \n\n[1] On the Expressive Power of Sparse Geometric MPNNs.

This aims to mitigate earlier costly approaches of taking the power graph of the original graph. The authors first prove theoretical properties of their construction and show that maximally expressive MPNNs with particular initializations for node and edge features can distinguish among generic graphs, essentially proving that via a sparse graph structure (degree bounded by 3) 1-WL can distinguish all generic point cloud configurations (i.e. not assuming a fully connected point cloud as in earlier works). The authors then empirically show the construction's efficacy and value of the SCHull face angles that allow for universality on sparse configurations, by obtaining consistently better results on synthetic, classification, and regression tasks."

Although, I believe that tying these two areas together constitutes a strong advancement for ML.\n\n2. The empirical results are consistent yet are not pushing the boundary on SOTA, but rather give a `boost' to low expressive models. It would be nice to see the performance of working on SCHull graphs with the initial edge and node features for more expressive architecture, for instance, MACE or SEGNN (\"Geometric and physical quantities improve equivariant message passing\", Brandstetter et al.) I suspect it would make less of a difference but please prove me wrong. Anyway, only having a comparable result to these architectures (when they process distance-restricted graphs) with faster inference is still a great achievement. If this is performed I may increase my score.\n\n3. The background for geometric deep learning is insufficient in my opinion. For instance, there is no discussion on research on expressivity when point clouds are not necessarily generic and a comparison of your approach with models that are universal (or complete) on **all** point clouds.

I do have a few questions though:\na) \"Since the degrees of corresponding nodes are equal, both graphs have the same number of edges, i.e., |E| = |E\u2032|.\" I don't see why this is true, later you discuss how the corresponding edges match because of the generic nature of the point cloud, and then by equality of multisets you could have claimed the number of edges is equivalent.I might be missing something.\nb) \"Next, we observe that the triple (\u2225xi \u2212 xj \u2225, \u2225xi \u2212 x\u2225 , \u2225xj \u2212 x\u2225) uniquely determines the distance between\nprojected points px(xi), px(xj ) on the unit sphere.\" \nI don't see how I recover $|| \\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{|| x_i - \\bar{x}||} - \\frac{x_j - \\bar{x}}{|| x_j - \\bar{x}||} ||$ from those three distances, please enlighten me.\n\n2. There exist known counterexamples for fully connected geometric graphs that 1-WL cannot distinguish. It may be the case that your maximally expressive SCHull-MPNN with edge features and node features can distinguish. One such example is depicted in Figure 1 in [Li et al.]. They have code for the coordinates of these shapes or I can also provide them if necessary. Is the maximally expressive architecture you propose able to distinguish among them?\n\n\n[Li et al.]Li, Zian, et al. \"Is distance matrix enough for geometric deep learning?.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024)."

The proposed method ensures key properties such as connectivity, sparsity of the graph, and the ability to accurately reconstruct the original point cloud. These properties are essential for both efficient computation and the preservation of the inherent structure of the data.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the authors effectively balance the need for a graph that is sufficiently sparse\u2014thereby reducing computational complexity\u2014while still maintaining connectivity, which is necessary for capturing the relationships between points in the cloud. This delicate balance is often difficult to achieve, as sparse graphs may lose critical information, and densely connected graphs can lead to inefficiency and overfitting. The authors\u2019 method overcomes this trade-off and ensures that the graph retains the essential features of the point cloud, enabling reliable downstream analysis.\n\nAdditionally, the paper demonstrates how the performance of existing methods can be significantly improved by replacing the traditional graph construction techniques with the newly proposed combinatorial graph. The empirical results presented show notable enhancements in areas such as classification accuracy, clustering performance, and point cloud segmentation, underscoring the practical benefits of the new graph structure. These improvements are a testament to the robustness and effectiveness of the method, positioning it as a valuable tool for a wide range of applications in fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and graph signal processing.\n\nThe introduction of this novel graph construction framework represents a substantial step forward in the field, potentially opening new avenues for research on graph-based point cloud analysis. It not only improves existing methodologies but also provides a foundation for further exploration of how combinatorial structures can be leveraged to better understand and manipulate high-dimensional data.\""

Instead, it creates its own selected graph, which may limit its applicability in cases where the underlying graph already contains valuable domain-specific information. This approach lacks flexibility, especially in scenarios where a smooth transition or integration with existing graph structures is required. As a result, the method may overlook important attributes or contextual details in real-world applications, reducing its versatility.

After Theorem 3.6, add a remark noting that implementations of maximally expressive GNNs for generic point clouds exist, such as in Sverdlov & Dym.\n3. Figure 4 and its details should be moved to the experiments section.\n4. All theorems and propositions should either be restated in the appendix or, at the very least, have a mention of what is to be proven there.\n\n**Conceptual Issues:**\n1. In your framework, you separate complete generic geometric graphs, unlike Joshi [23] and Sverdlov [24], who work with given combinatorial graphs. This difference should be explicitly stated in your setup, and it should be clear that the goal is to construct the underlying graph.\n2. The discontinuity of your graph construction should be discussed. Since the function is discrete, it cannot be continuous, but this point should be acknowledged.\n3. Proposition 3.1 is not proven at all. Some minimal proof or explanation is necessary.\n4. Regarding the MD17 experiments, I would like to know which models you considered in your comparison and, specifically, if your method improved in the SOTA method. Same for protein folding.\n5.
