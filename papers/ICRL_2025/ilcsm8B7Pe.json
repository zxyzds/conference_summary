    "title": "End-to-End Conformal Prediction for Trajectory Optimization",
    "abstract": "Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from the decision-making end fails to be transmitted back to instruct the CP end. In this paper, we propose a novel End-to-End CP (E2E-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP end, enabling attractive end-to-end adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such end-to-end adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with E2E-CP. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.",

                "value": "Please see the above limitations and address the questions. In addition to the limitations, another question is:\n\nBased on Eqs. 9, 13, and 17, both the upper bound of the posterior violation probability and the allocable risk at specific time step are fixed for the average risk allocation setting, as the upper bound of the posterior violation probability is calculated based on the calibration data D_{cal}^{2}. This violates the real-world situation where the real-world data and calibration data follow different distribution. However, experiment result in Table 1 shows that this average risk allocation method still achieves 89.1% collision avoidance rate. Are there any data distribution shifts in the testing data? If not, what\u2019s the performance of the proposed method under distribution shift?"

                "value": "1. I have concerns regarding the assumptions made in this paper, particularly the strong independence assumptions on obstacle trajectories, which form the basis of the proposed algorithm. In Section 3.1, the authors assume the independence between D and system (1) (lines 134-135) and further assume that the real joint obstacle trajectory Y and the N available joint obstacle trajectories Y^(i) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) (lines 143-145). However, in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, obstacle trajectories\u2014specifically those of other vehicles on the road\u2014are highly interdependent, as each vehicle\u2019s decisions are influenced by the behaviors of surrounding vehicles. The interdependence between obstacle trajectories is a key factor contributing to the complexity of real-world problems. Assuming independence significantly simplifies the problem but may limit the algorithm's applicability in practical, interdependent scenarios. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a justification for these independence assumptions and to identify any real-world applications where obstacle trajectories can be reasonably assumed to be independent.\n2. Another concern is the limited performance improvement observed with the proposed algorithm. In Table 1, the collision avoidance rate shows only a marginal increase, raising questions about the practical impact of the algorithm. Furthermore, in Table 3 (Appendix C.2), the collision avoidance rate actually decreases when using the proposed algorithm, suggesting potential issues with its robustness. Additionally, the benchmark experiments include only two robotic systems, which may not provide sufficient diversity to fully evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness across different scenarios.\n3. Additionally, this paper\u2019s focus on trajectory optimization is largely unrelated to machine learning or deep learning. Given the emphasis on trajectory optimization techniques rather than learning-based methods, it would be more appropriately submitted to robotics-focused publication venues rather than conferences dedicated to deep learning.\n4. Minor typo: On line 190, \"level beta\" should be corrected to \"level alpha.\""

As noted in the weaknesses section, it would be valuable for the authors to provide a rationale for these independence assumptions and to highlight any real-world applications in which obstacle trajectories can reasonably be assumed to be independent.\n2. The paper would benefit from additional benchmark examples beyond the two robotic systems currently evaluated. Expanding the benchmarks would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's effectiveness across diverse scenarios.\n3. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify why a paper focused on trajectory optimization, rather than on learning-based approaches, is suitable for a deep learning conference."

The proposed algorithm includes a chance-constrained optimization problem that applies conformal prediction (CP) in two ways. First, it uses forward-looking CP to predict a priori confidence intervals for future obstacle positions, which are used for planning. Second, it uses backward-looking CP to compute the posterior confidence intervals of past obstacle positions to estimate how much of the risk budget was actually \"used up\" compared to the planned amount of risk. The risk budget freed up by this backward-looking assessment is applied to future timesteps, allowing less conservative behavior. The experiments are simple, presenting well-chosen ablations rather than a comprehensive suite of baseline methods, but I found them to be compelling."
