    "title": "Unifying Structural Proximity and Equivalence for Enhanced Dynamic Network Embedding",
    "abstract": "Dynamic network embedding methods transform nodes in a dynamic network into low-dimensional vectors while preserving network characteristics, facilitating tasks such as node classification and community detection. Several embedding methods have been proposed to capture $\\textit{structural proximity}$ among nodes in a network, where densely connected communities are preserved, while others have been proposed to preserve $\\textit{structural equivalence}$ among nodes, capturing their structural roles regardless of their relative distance in the network. However, most existing methods that aim to preserve $\\textit{both}$ network characteristics mainly focus on static networks and those designed for dynamic networks do not explicitly account for inter-snapshot structural properties. This paper proposes a novel unifying dynamic network embedding method that simultaneously preserves both structural proximity and equivalence while considering inter-snapshot structural relationships in a dynamic network. Specifically, to define structural equivalence in a dynamic network, we use temporal subgraphs, known as dynamic graphlets, to capture how a node's neighborhood structure evolves over time. We then introduce a temporal-structural random walk to flexibly sample time-respecting sequences of nodes, considering both their temporal proximity and similarity in evolving structures. The proposed method is evaluated using five real-world networks on node classification where it outperforms benchmark methods, showing its effectiveness and flexibility in capturing various aspects of a network.",

                "value": "The authors consider the problem of node embedding in dynamic networks. Two main types of embeddings are present in the literature: ones based on structural proximity (e.g., neighborhood-based embeddings) and ones based on structural equivalence (e.g., role-based embeddings). The authors propose a straightforward approach to capture both types into a single embedding using random walks on the temporal neighborhood and the structural neighborhood. They demonstrate improved node classification accuracy on 5 real network data sets."

None of the baselines include both a structural proximity and equivalence component. A more useful comparison could be to a convex combination of a structural proximity embedding (e.g., CTDNE) + a structural equivalence embedding (e.g., D-GDV).\n- No visualization or interpretation of embeddings is provided. This is also a weak point of the proposed single embedding combining structural proximity and equivalence--there is no ability to identify similar nodes according to each individual criterion."

Why should a practitioner choose your proposed approach rather than just training both a structural proximity embedding and a structural equivalence embedding and then taking a convex combination of them?

From your experiments, it appears that the structural equivalence-based embeddings perform much worse in node classification. Do you have any interpretation on why this is the case?"

Especially in the work of Hoff (2007) the capturing of homophily and structural equivalence is achieved via the proximity metric chosen for expressing the node similarity. This essentially unifies the efforts adressed in this paper. It would be beneficial to the paper to also address/discuss such settings and how they are relevant to their method.\n\n- 2) The proposed focuses on the temporal graph learning but the experimental set-up is focused on the static downstream task of node classification. There exist additional tasks the authors could consider like in \u00c7elikkanat et al. (2022).\n\n- 3) The. obtained results in the task of node classification provide in many cases marginal improvements that are within the standard deviations margins when compared to the other baselines. Additional results for significance should be performed like a Paired t-test or something similar.\n\n- 4) The performance is based on the optimal alpha value, that if I am not mistaken is chosen based on the test set performance, introducing bias in the results.\n\n- 5) Lack of artificial networks study; the optimal alpha value is found to be very small, as fast by the authors in their manuscript. Thus the importance of the method falls somehow short. The method should be established also in artificial networks that the setting can be controlled to show regimes where the alpha value gets a bigger role to successfully learn the node embeddings and roles.\n\n\n\n\nPeter D.

However, in temporal networks, structural roles and equivalences of nodes might also change over time. It would be helpful for readers if the authors provided the motivation for why they preferred this method.\n\nThe reliance on temporal graphlets, as introduced in previous work (Hulovatyy et al., 2015), alongside a random-walking strategy that integrates DeepWalk and its extension to temporal networks, CTDNE, limits the originality of the proposed method. \n\nIt is unclear how the model parameters were tuned since the use of a validation set is not specified. Were parameters chosen based on training or test set performance?\n\nThe chosen baselines are not recent approaches. Authors should consider the more recent works such as [1,2]. Additionally, it is unclear whether the static approaches were run on the network as a whole by aggregating the link or on specific time slices, and whether baseline hyperparameters were optimized or left as defaults. Greater clarity on these aspects would strengthen the experimental section of the work.\n\nSince node labels in dynamic networks may vary over time, the authors should clarify if they assume fixed labels across the timeline. The networks are also discrete-time and if the node labels are fixed, it would be interesting to explore the performance of the static approaches when they are run only by using the edges in the last time step or in the recent time steps.\n\nThe high time complexity of the proposed method raises concerns regarding its applicability to large-scale networks. The authors should discuss any strategies or future work aimed at addressing this limitation.\n\nIn Definition 3.3.1, the notation $t_i$ indicates the initial time of the edge but the meaning of $\\sigma_i$ remains ambiguous. Clarifying this would help readers follow the notations in the paper.\n\nIn Lines 307-308, the authors state that $T(v_{i\u2212\\omega} ,v_{i\u2212\\omega+1}) \u2264 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2264T(v_{i+\\omega}\u22121,v_i+\\omega )$ but it might not always hold since we also sample from $P_S$.\n\n- *[1] Rossi, Emanuele, et al. \"Temporal graph networks for deep learning on dynamic graphs.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.10637 (2020).*\n- *[2] \u00c7elikkanat, Abdulkadir, Nikolaos Nakis, and Morten M\u00f8rup. \"Piecewise-velocity model for learning continuous-time dynamic node* representations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.12345 (2022).*\n\n**Decision**\n\nI recommend rejecting this paper due to my concerns about originality and experiments.
