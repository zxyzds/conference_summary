    "title": "Common Neighbor Induced Message Passing for Inductive Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Inductive link prediction is a significant challenge in knowledge graphs, focusing on predicting potential relations between unseen entities during training. A promising approach is to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract entity-independent features from surrounding subgraphs. However, existing mainstream subgraph extraction methods may lead to the loss of key entities and relations, resulting in many disconnected reasoning paths that seriously hinder effective message passing. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Common Neighbor Induced Message Passing (CNMP), designed to enhance message passing even when reasoning paths are disconnected. We observe that the common neighbors of two entities must share a reasoning path. Based on this insight, CNMP enhances message passing by updating the distance labels of isolated common neighbors, even if they are unreachable. This allows CNMP to incorporate new connected equivalent relations, facilitating effective message passing. Furthermore, we introduce a CNMP+ strategy that further improves the preservation of entities and relations during the message-passing process. CNMP+ involves maintaining a list of common neighbors at various distances and using a probing strategy to reconstruct complete reasoning paths. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

                "value": "1. The paper's motivation requires stronger justification. While the authors emphasize reasoning paths and propose methods to learn inductive patterns from common neighbors within the reasoning paths, they overlook crucial information contained in non-common neighbors. Knowledge in KGs often exists in diverse structural forms beyond simple reasoning paths - including tree-like and ego-graph-like structures. Consider an entity connected to multiple isolated neighbors through relations like 'born_in' and 'live_in'; these connections, though not part of a reasoning path, provide vital contextual information suggesting the entity is likely a person rather than a product. Furthermore, GNNs inherently excel at capturing such diverse knowledge structures through message passing. By focusing exclusively on common neighbors and reasoning paths, the proposed approach may unnecessarily constrain the model's ability to leverage the full spectrum of available knowledge patterns in the graph.\n\n2. As the most crucial component of the inductive model, how to perform KG reasoning with unseen entities has not been well-analyzed in this paper. How could the model initialize or learn the embeddings of unseen entities? How does the model extract entity-independent features from the surrounding subgraphs for inductive KG reasoning?\n\n3. The overall structure of this paper could be improved. The authors include several Q&As at the end of the Appendix. However, these do not further clarify the proposed model, as it is difficult to link them to the relevant sections of the main content. If the information in these Q&As is important, the authors should integrate them into the main body of the paper to provide better context and understanding.\n\n4. More experiments are needed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. For instance, is there any case study to show how the model performs inductive reasoning based on the common neighbors?\n\n5. Some experiment results are suspicious. For example, Tables 16 and 17 share the same result, even changing the 2-hop EG into 3-hop EG."

For instance, in GraIL\u2019s code, both `np.max(dist)` and `np.sum(dist)` lead to issues. This paper primarily addresses these problems, though it does not clearly distinguish this context.\n\n- The proof in Appendix A seems unnecessary, as it presents an obvious conclusion. Additionally, the proof lacks a condition specifying that if edge (A, r, B) exists, then edge (B, r_inverse, A) must also exist. Without this, since KGs are directed graphs, two nodes with a common neighbor may not have a connected path.\n\n- Prior works, such as NBFNet, adopt the evaluation setting of treating all entities as candidates instead of the 50-negative setting. Reporting results with all entities as candidates would allow for a more reliable performance comparison.\n\n- For the experiments in Section 3.5 and Table 6, fully-inductive datasets such as RMPI and \"Ingram: Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding via Relation Graphs, ICML 2023\" are available. What was the motivation for constructing new datasets in this work?\n\n- In the runtime experiment in Appendix B.8.3, only the smaller v1 dataset is used. A comparison on the larger v4 dataset would be more convincing. Additional details, such as whether the reported runtime includes preprocessing (especially for closed subgraph construction), are also needed.\n\n- The source code and newly constructed dataset have not been provided, despite the authors' commitment to release them after the paper\u2019s acceptance."
