    "title": "Diffusion Models are Evolutionary Algorithms",
    "abstract": "In a convergence of machine learning and biology, we reveal that diffusion models are evolutionary algorithms. By considering evolution as a denoising process and reversed evolution as diffusion, we mathematically demonstrate that diffusion models inherently perform evolutionary algorithms, naturally encompassing selection, mutation, and reproductive isolation. Building on this equivalence, we propose the Diffusion Evolution method: an evolutionary algorithm utilizing iterative denoising -- as originally introduced in the context of diffusion models -- to heuristically refine solutions in parameter spaces. Unlike traditional approaches, Diffusion Evolution efficiently identifies multiple optimal solutions and outperforms prominent mainstream evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, leveraging advanced concepts from diffusion models, namely latent space diffusion and accelerated sampling, we introduce Latent Space Diffusion Evolution, which finds solutions for evolutionary tasks in high-dimensional complex parameter space while significantly reducing computational steps. This parallel between diffusion and evolution not only bridges two different fields but also opens new avenues for mutual enhancement, raising questions about open-ended evolution and potentially utilizing non-Gaussian or discrete diffusion models in the context of Diffusion Evolution.",

                "value": "The authors try to connect Diffusion Models and Evolutionary computation by arguing that both processes do iterative refinements through an update rule plus some perturbation. In evolutionary algorithms the update comes in the form of natural selection, in diffusion is the denoising phase. The perturbation corresponds to mutation for evolution, and the diffusion phase for diffusion models. \n\nFrom the above connection an evolutionary algorithm that performs in its iteration a diffusion process is proposed.  Instead of aiming to recover some distribution of the data, the goal is to turn the random initial population points towards a distribution centered around the optimized function optimum."

It views the evolution processes as the denoising process of diffusion models, and designs an evolutionary algorithm named Diffusion Evolution, which is based on the denoising framework of the famous diffusion model DDIM. During evolution, it takes each individual in the population as a solution in the denoising process, and updates it with similar updating rules in DDIM. To facilitate better performance, it further follows previous works to optimize in the latent space. Experiments on several benchmark functions and a simple cart-pole controlling problem show that compared with classic baseline methods include CMA-ES, OpenES and PEPG, the proposed Diffusion Evolution can obtain more diverse solutions with good fitness."

However, the proposed Diffusion Evolution in this paper is lack of theoretical analysis. Meanwhile, the experiments are much too simple. For example, only five synthetic functions and a simple cart-pole controlling problem are included. As the diversity of solutions seems to be the strength of the proposed Diffusion Evolution, except for methods like CMA-ES, which are not specified for diversity, comparison with other kinds of evolutionary algorithms like Quality-Diversity (QD) are necessary."

                "value": "1. The mathematical demonstration process in this manuscript is insufficient. The authors conceptualize the evolution process as a transformation of the probability density function, deriving the diffusion evolution algorithm from the Bayesian formula. However, this derivation overlooks key complexities inherent in evolutionary dynamics, such as genetic drift and gene recombination. Additionally, the application of the Bayesian formula assumes conditional independence, which may not be held in the context of evolutionary processes due to the interactions and competition among individuals. Furthermore, the manuscript does not provide a clear explanation of how to effectively map a complex fitness function into a probability density function, which is essential for the practical implementation of the proposed model.\n2. Since the author claims that the diffusion model functions as an evolutionary algorithm, the experimental section must reflect this comparison appropriately. Specifically, in scenarios involving multiple tasks and comparisons, aspects such as speed, performance metrics (including best, worst, median, and average results), and the stability of performance should be examined. Additionally, the model's excellence should be illustrated through the mean variance of the results. Currently, the scope of experiments conducted is insufficient and does not adequately support the claims made in the manuscript.\n3. There are several grammatical errors and unclear expressions throughout the article. For example, the definitions of certain terms lack clarity, the derivation process for the formulas is inadequately explained, and the labeling of the charts is inaccurate.\n4. The authors categorize diffusion models as evolutionary algorithms on the basis that both methods perform distribution transformation. However, this classification may be overly broad. For instance, semantic segmentation models also involve transforming distributions\u2014from real images to pixel-level segmentation results. Should we, therefore, classify these segmentation models as evolutionary algorithms as well? This comparison seems inaccurate. A more robust argument would establish that the Markov process within a non-equilibrium thermodynamics framework (diffusion) function as an unconstrained parameter optimization technique (evolution). If this argument cannot be substantiated, I recommend revising the title to better reflect the content.\n5. The manuscript presents two primary sets of experiments: multi-objective evolution and latent space diffusion evolution. However, the multi-objective evolution experiments are limited to a two-dimensional parameter space and a simplistic fitness function, which fails to demonstrate the proposed approach's efficacy in high-dimensional parameter spaces or with more complex fitness functions. Similarly, the latent space diffusion evolution experiments focus solely on the CartPole task, lacking validation across a broader range of reinforcement learning tasks. Furthermore, the experimental results do not include any statistical significance tests, making it challenging to determine whether the observed improvements in algorithm performance are statistically significant. This omission significantly undermines the credibility of the findings presented."
