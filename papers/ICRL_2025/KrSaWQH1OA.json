    "title": "AhmedML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Incompressible, Low-Speed Bluff Body Aerodynamics",
    "abstract": "The development of Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently limited by the lack of openly available training data. This paper presents a new open-source dataset comprising of high fidelity, scale-resolving CFD simulations of 500 geometric variations of the Ahmed Car Body - a simplified car-like shape that exhibits many of the flow topologies that are present on bluff bodies such as road vehicles. The dataset contains simulation results that exhibit a broad set of fundamental flow physics such as geometry and pressure-induced flow separation as well as 3D vortical structures. Each variation of the Ahmed car body were run using a high-fidelity, time-accurate, hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) - Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence modelling approach using the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM. The dataset contains boundary, volume, geometry, and time-averaged forces/moments in widely used open-source formats. In addition, the OpenFOAM case setup is provided so that others can reproduce or extend the dataset. This represents to the authors knowledge, the first open-source large-scale dataset using high-fidelity CFD methods for the widely used Ahmed car body that is available to freely download with a permissive license (CC-BY-SA).",

                "value": "1. I believe the introduction and related work are relatively well-written and cited.  One area of research the authors may want to cite is the growing body of work on using DL to improve the linear solvers used in CFD solvers, including neural preconditioners; for example, \"A deep conjugate direction method for iteratively solving linear systems\" (ICML 2023) and \"A Neural-preconditioned Poisson Solver for Mixed Dirichlet and Neumann Boundary Conditions\" (ICML 2024).\n\n2. The dataset that is developed in this submission is licensed very permissively, which means anyone could use the results from this manuscript."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Although I do like the related work, an issue is that the authors state \"several groups have generated large-scale training data to demonstrate the potential of their ML methods,\" and that the main issue is those datasets aren't free/open-source.  I do appreciate the value of an open-source dataset, but the novelty of the present work is pretty limited; the main advantage is that it's open-source.\n\n2. Specifically, the difference between DrivAerNet and the present work appears to be (1) the specific geometries tested (this is easy to swap out), (2) the solver choice in OpenFOAM (this is an easy setting to change), and the license (DrivAerNet uses an open-source license, too, but not one the authors like).  While I appreciate that the present dataset's license allows for commercial usage, unlike DrivAerNet, I don't think this is a research contribution.\n\n3. The authors emphasize the realism of their results, using somewhat accurate CFD algorithms in OpenFOAM, yet their \"car\" geometries are extremely basic.  While it's nice that their geometries are parametric and one can easily generate variations of these, if the emphasis of the paper is on realism, it seems like one should use a bunch of real-world (or even slightly more car-shaped) car geometries / CAD models.\n\n4. Relatedly, the authors claim that using their chosen hybrid RANS-LES solver in OpenFOAM produces results that are more accurate than other models, but they do not demonstrate that - in the end - their dataset enables better results than a similar dataset crafted with the same geometries but a cheaper solver.  In other words: how much is gained by using this particular OpenFOAM solver?\n\n5. The appendix/supplementary material for this submission seems exceptionally long.  The ICLR page limit is 9 pages, and the current submission extends to 41 pages.  I do not think this entire appendix is necessary in a submission.  For instance, Fig. 10 is a repeat of Fig. 6, and various text around there is repeated from the text in the main body.\n\n6. (Minor) It would be nice to include the R^2 coefficients for Figure 6 or some similar statistical quantitative measurements of how good the fits are."

The dataset uses an unstructured grid generated through the OpenFoam mesh generation utility, and varies various aspects of the bodies in consideration, such as the geometry (length, width, height) and angle of the rear window. Velocities and pressure profiles are provided, together with lift and drag coefficients. In other words, material is provided to conduct bluff body simulations using machine learning techniques.\n\nThey provide a single evaluation case using graph neural networks, as regards ML validation."

We need to run more experiments to evaluate the fitness of the dataset. Examples:\n a. Are the number of samples in a given setting enough to obtain reasonable numbers? \nb. How does the dataset fare for a given task and method (surrogate modelling, for instance)?\n\n- Comparison with the other datasets mentioned in the paper: WindsorML and DrivAerML.

The inclusion of some runs with full time-history could enhance the dataset\u2019s utility for dynamic flow predictions.\n2. The Ahmed Car Body, though a standard benchmark for bluff body aerodynamics, does not capture the complexity of real-world vehicle geometries. This simplification may limit the dataset\u2019s relevance for industrial applications.\n3.
