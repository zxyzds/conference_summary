    "title": "TopoSD: Topology-Enhanced Lane Segment Perception with SDMap prior",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous driving systems have shifted towards reducing reliance on high-definition maps (HDMaps) due to the huge costs of annotation and maintenance. Instead, researchers are focusing on online vectorized HDMap construction using on-board sensors. However, sensor-only approaches still face challenges for long-range perception due to the limited field of view of cameras, as human drivers also need navigation maps for comprehensive geometric and topological road information.\n To address these issues, we propose to train the perception model to \"see\" standard definition maps (SDMaps). We encode SDMap elements into neural spatial map representations and instance tokens, and then incorporate such complementary features as prior information to improve the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature for lane geometry and topology decoding. Based on the lane segment representation framework, the model simultaneously predicts lanes, centrelines and their topology. To further enhance the ability of geometry prediction and topology reasoning, we also use a topology-guided decoder to refine the predictions\n by exploiting the mutual relationships between topological and geometric features. We perform extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 datasets to validate the proposed method. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with gains of +6.7 and +9.1 on the mAP and topology metrics. Our analysis also reveals that models trained with SDMap noise augmentation exhibit enhanced robustness.",

Task Choice:\n\n> Instead, researchers are focusing on online vectorized HDMap construction \u2026 However, sensor-only approaches still face challenges for long-range perception due to the limited field of view of camera, \u2026 \n\nThe paper\u2019s abstract suggests a focus on addressing challenges in long-range perception due to camera field-of-view limitations. Given this:\n\n  a. Why does this work emphasize the Topology task for incorporating SDMap rather than focusing on an HDMap task?\n\n  b. For topology reasoning, why was the OpenLaneV2 **lane segment** task selected over the OpenLaneV2 **lane centerline** task?\n\n2. Decoder Analysis\n\nIn the ablation study (Table 3, last two rows), the authors compare the performance impact of using the Topo-Guided Decoder based on an SDMap incorporation baseline. Have the authors considered evaluating the Topo-Guided Decoder on a baseline without SDMap integration? It would be helpful to understand whether this module maintains effectiveness in the absence of SDMap incorporation.\n\n3. Generalizability of SDMap Fusion Method:\n\nWhile the paper aims to leverage SDMap to address sensor limitations, it is unclear whether the proposed SDMap encoding and fusion method can also enhance performance in other BEV map-based tasks beyond the current setup.\n\nGiven that the combination of P-MapNet with LaneSegNet lowers LaneSegNet\u2019s original performance (Table 1), additional experiments on other tasks would clarify the versatility and potential trade-offs of this fusion approach."

The spatial map encoding is added into the initial BEV query and the SDMaps tokens are used as key and values in the cross attention of BEV encoder.

I will consider improve my rating if the authors can address my concern.\n2.

Multiple heads are concatenated to enable the model to simultaneously predict various elements that are required by the online road map.

Since the TopoSD is robust to the influence of SDMap deviation or rotation, how much SDMap contribute to the perception result of TopoSD? Besides, there seems no specific design to rectify the SDMap prior errors in your model design.\n- As shown in Table 4, the performance of TopoSD trained with SDMap noise is even worse than the baseline LaneSegNet without any SDMap priors.
