    "title": "Spectral Operator Methods for Learning Coherent Temporal Representations in Cellular Signaling Dynamics",
    "abstract": "We present a novel operator-based framework for learning coherent temporal representations of cellular dynamics from live-cell imaging data. Recognizing the inherent stochasticity and measurement limitations in biological systems, our approach shifts the focus from predicting exact trajectories to characterizing key dynamical properties that shape cellular behaviors at the population level. By leveraging spectral analysis of the Koopman operator and smoothing via Markov semigroups of kernel integral operators, we identify near-resonant patterns and transient coherent structures that persist across different experimental conditions. This methodology effectively captures fundamental dynamics, providing insights into mechanisms of heterogeneous cell responses without the need to model precise transformation laws. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a dataset of retinal pigment epithelial cells with an inducible oncogene, revealing conserved dynamical patterns across varying levels of ERK inhibition. Our work offers interpretable learned representations, even with limited and noisy single-cell-resolved recordings, advancing machine learning for dynamical systems and opening new avenues for understanding and predicting cellular behavior in response to external stimuli.",

Here, I am open to \"work\" being defined in many ways, including improved accuracy, timing, interpretability, or even elegance.  But I see literally zero numerical or analytic comparisons to any other method.  Thus, I have no idea whether this is the most valuable advance in modeling dynamics since Kalman, or relatively useless, because other things work just as well."

What is a \"Koopman Operator\".  \"Regulon\"? \"Isogenic\"? Please introduce any technical concepts that are not textbook \"AI\", so the reader can follow more easily. This includes \" smoothing via Markov semigroups of kernel integral operators\", for example.  \n\n- line 60: \"low in dimensionality, posing significant challenges for analysis.\"  Why does low-dimensionality pose a challenge?\n\n- I don't really understand what is new.  Are the methods new, or just a new application of standard stuff?  4  pages are devoted to explaining them, and they are complicated.\n\n- How is this stuff related to functional PCA, which is a fairly well established approach to modeling dynamics at scale.  It seems highly related.  I see no discussion of how other approaches might be able to solve this problem.  I have a paper on something similar, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865516303671, which seems like maybe it would be applicable? If fPCA and RR-System Identification are not applicable to this problem, I'd want to understand why not.  If so, I'd want to see benchmarks comparing this to something else."

Given that such is missing, it is challenging to accurately assess the contribution of this work. \n- *Implementation details*: While a thorough theoretical description is presented, an implementation or pseudocode is missing, and is valuable for readers wishing to use the methods. Next, the authors briefly relate to the \"Computational considerations\"; claiming that the approach can handle large datasets efficiently. This claim is very vague and it is hard to judge the practical applicability of the framework. \n- *Experimental results*: The actual analysis presented is very limited. Biological interpretability boils down to the analysis of two Koopman modes, and the reconstruction/prediction performance are only assessed visually (at poor resolution). Moreover, following the contextualization to prior work, reconstruction/prediction performance is not compared to alternative approaches.\n\nPlease refer to the Questions section for practical suggestions in light of the above comments."

The claim is that avoiding learning specific trajectories, as is the common approach, and instead going towards more general dynamical properties of these trajectories, can allow learning interpretable, robust representations for noisy data such as single-cell resolved datasets. The authors demonstrate their method by identifying conserved dynamical patterns in a dataset of retinal pigment epithelial cells with an inducible oncogene. Specifically, the respective experiments capture the dynamics of ERK activity and proliferation given varying levels of ERK inhibition, and the authors claim that while learning exact trajectories is infeasible in this scenario, they are able to capture conserved temporal patterns across different inhibition levels."

For example, can you support your statement that the shift in the first mode reflects inhibition of ERK activity? Or why it reflects \u2018a probabilistic shift\u2019? Or what is the significance of the oscillatory behavior of the second mode? Can you support your hypothesis that it is related to the cell cycle for example? (and if that\u2019s the case, then how is this \u2018intrinsic cyclical dynamics within the ERK signaling network\u2019?)\n- Figure 3 is missing a statistical analysis over all cell trajectories, not just a visualizing of a single (\u201ccherry-picked\u201d?) cell.\n- What is the rationale behind generalizing to unseen data that is under a different biological setting? Why do you expect good generalization in that case at all? This needs to be better explained. \n- Discussion of limitations of the approach should be added.\n- It seems that the conclusions throughout the paper should be phrased more modestly given the limited extent of analysis on real biological data.\n- \u2018Compared to approaches using functional data analysis or deep learning architectures, our framework offers significant advantages. It provides interpretable representations through Koopman eigenfunctions, corresponding to meaningful temporal patterns in the data, unlike black-box models.\u2019 - But what are the potential disadvantages?\n\nMinor:\n- \u2018aligning with the idea\u2019 - typo?\n- \u2018coherent temporal patterns\u2019 - not defined\n- The resolution/quality of some of the figures/panels should be improved"
