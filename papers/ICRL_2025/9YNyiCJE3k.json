    "title": "OSDA Agent: Leveraging Large Language Models for De Novo Design of Organic Structure Directing Agents",
    "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline porous materials that have been widely utilized in petrochemical industries as well as sustainable chemistry areas. Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs. Experiments on representative zeolite frameworks show the generation-evaluation-reflection-refinement workflow can perform de novo design of OSDAs with superior generation quality than the pure LLM model, generating candidates consistent with experimentally validated OSDAs and optimizing known OSDAs. \nThe code and model will be publicly available.",

An Evaluator that employs computational chemistry tools (RDKit for validity, SCScore for synthesis feasibility) and a novel binding energy model(having an MAE of 0.384 kJ/mol Si) to assess generated structures. \n\n3. A Self-Reflector using GPT-4o that provides iterative feedback based on evaluations stored in memory to improve chemical validity, synthetic feasibility, and binding energy estimations through a generation-evaluation-reflection-refinement workflow.\n\nThe authors validate their framework across multiple zeolite types, demonstrating its ability to generate chemically valid OSDA candidates outperforming the baselines across multiple similatiy metrics. Additionally, the framework successfully optimizes existing OSDA molecules, reducing their synthetic complexity scores from 3.45 to 2.46 while maintaining their functional properties and keeping binding energies within desired ranges (-3.38 to -9.00 kcal/mol). The authors benchmark their experiments against other methods such as MolT5 and BioT5 using diverse metrics including validity, MACCS, and BLEU scores.

Robustness of the input to the agent model: as there are multiple ways to represent a chemical, does this model support multiple chemical expressions, i.e. chemical formulas like H2O and IUPAC names like oxidane?

Accuracy of binding energy estimation model: this work proposes a new binding energy estimation model to lower the computational complexity of previous computational tools, but how accurate is this estimation model, and is the estimation from this model comparable to traditional atomic simulation methods?  \n3. LLM consideration: this work considers OpenAI's GPT models as the base LLM for the agent, and they are not open-source models and would be potentially costly to use, is there any reason that the authors did not also consider open-source models like Llama and Mistral, or would you consider experimenting with those open-source models? \n4. Performances of the baseline models: curious about performance compared to baseline models, specifically for the 'validity' metric the authors proposed, how is this calculated, is it based on results from multiple computational models? This question stems from the result showing that one of the baseline models has a validity score of 0.00 for both datasets whereas the proposed model has a score of 100. \n5. Memory and cost: this agent model includes a reflection mechanism and the paper also shows the number of reflections vs SCScore plot, showing that 4 reflections would reduce the synthesis difficulty, would having more reflections yield even better performances, and what is the cost of reflections?\n6. Safety concerns: do GPT models always fulfill users' requests, and is there any case that the model refuses to fulfill the request or gives out a warning due to safety concerns of the generation process or the chemical itself, or is there any case that the model fails to generate the answer due to its limited knowledge of certain uncommon chemicals?"

This is valuable for the community since it shows the viability of prior work.\n\n[Results] Building on the previous strength, the use of the existing methods allowed authors to discover researched OSDAs as well as potentially new ones.

Linked to that, the description of related work could use some more detail, at least 1 example of an existing method and the way it works with a discussion on how the method presented in this work builds upon its weaknesses. The authors do try to convey that new algorithms for OSDAs are needed but it isn\u2019t clear to me why. Is it only the need to give feedback to the algorithm in order to get better outputs with the next iteration (impossible to achieve with traditional ML methods)? If so, why would it be so crucial for OSDAs? Is it that the current methods are ineffective for some subclass of OSDAs or\u2026?\n\n[Specificity] The work may be certainly worthwhile to OSDA specialists but I have doubts whether it would be of general interest. It shows how to apply an existing framework to a specific task of chemical agent construction. There seems to be limited novelty when it comes to representation learning itself or algorithmics in general. The reflection mechanism that verbalizes errors found by the Evaluator for future learning seems to be taken from a paper by Shin et al. (2024), and adjusted for this particular task, similarly to other used algorithms.\n\n[Clarity] As much as the manuscript is written well and it is possible to understand the syntax and often what is being conveyed, some of the jargon becomes weary and makes details intelligible. This happens in Section 3, where the data is described and seemingly one of the crucial contributions of the work \u2014 the binding energy. It is also evident in Section 4.1 \u2014the authors talk about SMILES sequences, In-Context Learning, Chain of Thought, etc. without ever defining, even intuitively, what these acronyms convey. See also RDKit, SCScore, etc. Section 4.1. would benefit from explaining intuition on the framework rather than an overview with specifics defined later.\n\n[Details] There are a lot of moving parts in the whole framework but there is little detail on how they work exactly. Which of the parts are new knowledge? How does the whole framework operate, from start to finish? Each step in the processing could be described in a separate subsection, to streamline presentation."
