    "title": "Invariant Spatiotemporal Representation Learning for Cross-patient Seizure Classification",
    "abstract": "Automatic seizure type classification from electroencephalogram (EEG) data can help clinicians to better diagnose epilepsy. Although many previous studies have focused on the classification problem of seizure EEG data, most of these methods require that there is no distribution shift between training data and test data, which greatly limits the applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an invariant spatiotemporal representation learning method for cross-patient seizure classification. Specifically, we first split the spatiotemporal EEG data into different environments based on heterogeneous risk minimization to reflect the spurious correlations. We then learn invariant spatiotemporal representations and train the seizure classification model based on the learned representations to achieve accurate seizure-type classification across various environments. The experiments are conducted on the largest public EEG dataset, the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

There are many publicly available epilepsy datasets; therefore, I suggest that the authors validate their approach on larger and more diverse epilepsy datasets.\n\nQ2: In the introduction, the authors' motivation for the study is not clearly articulated. They mention that this paper aims to address generalization ability and the cross-patient issue. However, as far as I know, cross-patient variability is no longer considered a significant problem. Since the proposed spatiotemporal invariant risk minimization (ST-IRM) loss function is intended to address these issues, it raises a question similar to my previous point (Q1): how can validation be assured on a single dataset?\n\nQ3: The description of the spatiotemporal invariant risk minimization (ST-IRM) loss lacks detailed mathematical derivation and intuitive explanations, particularly regarding the specific implementation details of the masking function.\n\nQ4: While the paper mentions several evaluation metrics, it lacks an in-depth analysis of the results, especially regarding performance differences across different patient groups and the reasons for those differences. The discussion of the results is relatively weak, and there is a lack of reflection on the potential limitations of the proposed method."

The objective is to learn invariant seizure-related features across different patients, thereby mitigating the impact of subject-specific noise. The approach integrates three types of losses: self-supervised loss, supervised loss, and invariant loss, to address domain shift issues inherent in subject-independent setups for EEG classification. The self-supervised learning component enhances the robustness of the invariant representation, the supervised learning component is responsible for predicting the labels, and the invariant risk minimization component reduces domain shifts caused by the presence of multiple subjects. A Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN) serves as the backbone model for training, and the Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) dataset is employed for performance evaluation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) **Effectiveness of Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM):** Although the motivation for using IRM is sound, I personally question the actual improvement this module provides. Based on my experience with other EEG datasets in subject-independent disease diagnosis tasks, IRM has shown poor performance, often yielding little to no improvement. In this context, an ablation study examining the impact of each loss function should be included, such as evaluating model performance after completely removing the IRM loss. Additionally, clustering subjects using K-means to apply IRM does not seem reasonable. Each subject should be treated as a distinct domain since each has unique subject-specific features. This can be easily validated by performing a subject ID discrimination task (mixing samples from all subjects and using subject IDs as labels to classify).\n\n2) **Specificity to Seizure Disease:** There is no specialized design tailored to seizure detection. What distinguishes seizure disorders from other EEG-based brain disease diagnoses, such as depression, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson\u2019s disease? The proposed method appears more like a generalized approach for all EEG-based brain disease classification tasks under the subject-independent setup. Therefore, it would be more compelling to evaluate your method on additional EEG datasets to establish broader applicability.\n\n3) **Clarity of Notations and Figures:** The current notations are confusing and tend to overcomplicate simple concepts. Additionally, Figure 2 is not informative enough. Instead of depicting the entire DCRNN pipeline (since the DCRNN design itself is not a novel contribution of this paper), it would be more helpful to provide a detailed illustration showing how the three loss modules are obtained and combined.\n\n4) **Baseline Comparisons:** The baseline methods included are insufficient. In my experience, many seemingly complex methods designed for EEG classification fail even to outperform simpler models like TCN or vanilla Transformer. A comparison with TCN and vanilla Transformer models should be presented. Given that your samples are 1-second intervals with a 200Hz frequency, ensure that the TCN model includes at least 6 layers to achieve a sufficient receptive field."
