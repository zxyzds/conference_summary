    "title": "Stochastic Sampling from Deterministic Flow Models",
    "abstract": "Deterministic flow models such as rectified flows offer a general framework for learning a deterministic transport map between two distributions, realized as the vector field for an ordinary differential equation (ODE). However, they are sensitive to estimation and discretization errors and do not permit different samples conditioned on an intermediate state. We present a general method to turn the underlying ODE of such flow models into a family of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that have the same marginal distributions. This method permits us to derive families of _stochastic samplers_, for fixed (e.g., previously trained) _deterministic_ flow models, that continuously span the spectrum of deterministic and stochastic sampling, given access to the flow field and the score function. Our method provides additional degrees of freedom that help alleviate some of the issues with the deterministic samplers and empirically outperforms them. We demonstrate this empirically on a toy Gaussian setup, as well as on the large scale ImageNet generation task. Further, our family of stochastic samplers provide an additional knob for controlling the diversity of generation, which we qualitatively demonstrate in our experiments.",

It would be great if the authors could address the following *primary concern* about the work\n\nCorollary 1 is already well known -- it is one of the main points of the interpolant procedure, and is the essential knob explored in 2303.08797, Corollary 2.18. This was then extensively tested (the variety of potential diffusion coefficients from the same velocity model) in 2401.08740. It's unclear to the reviewer how what this paper is proposing is different from these essential elements. In addition Corollary 1.2 in the given paper is already noticed by Song et al 2011.13456. The authors make remarks about these works in the \"related work\" section but do not seem to recognize this connection.\n\nBecause this is the main point of the paper given in this work, it is unclear to the reviewer what this paper sees as its main contribution to the literature."

The Theorem 1 can be understood as\n \n$\\bar{f}=f-\\frac{1}{2}[\\nabla(GG^T-(\\gamma_t GG^T+\\tilde{G}\\tilde{G}^T)]-\\frac{1}{2}[GG^T-(\\gamma_t GG^T+\\tilde{G}\\tilde{G}^T)]\\nabla \\log p$, \n\n$=f-\\frac{1}{2}[\\nabla(GG^T-\\bar{G}\\bar{G}^T)]-\\frac{1}{2}[GG^T-\\bar{G}\\bar{G}^T)]\\nabla \\log p$, \nand\n\n$\\bar{G}=[\\gamma_t GG^T+\\tilde{G}\\tilde{G}^T]^{1/2}$\n\nAccording to [1], The original SDE eq.4 can be written as,\n$dx_t= [f-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla[GG^T]-\\frac{1}{2}GG^T\\nabla\\log p]dt$\n\nOk then, all the tricks happen in the diffusion term of FPK. You can easily extend eq.28 in [1] with $x_t$ dependent $G(x,t)$ (it may give even more flexibility?), and absorbing the additional term into the drift term as shown in eq.37 in [2]. \n\nMy understanding is that, once an equivalence is established between flow/bridge models and diffusion models, the remaining work can be readily extended. \n\nHowever, I want to acknowledge the authors' efforts; despite the challenges of the problem, the community still benefits from having researchers dedicated to addressing it.\n\n[1]Zhang, Qinsheng, and Yongxin Chen. \"Fast sampling of diffusion models with exponential integrator.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.13902 (2022).\n\n[2]Song, Yang, et al. \"Score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.13456 (2020)."

Thank you for making it easy to engage with your work!\n- The authors provide a compelling empirical demonstration of the practical success of their method, on both toy and real-world data distributions.\n\nOverall, I believe this to be a very technically solid paper worthy of acceptance to ICLR. While the core idea of the contribution is not totally novel - the idea that one can convert between SDE and ODE sampling methods via rearranging the Fokker-Plank PDEs governing the marginals is implicit in previous work - this is the first work I'm aware of that demonstrates this practically in the ODE to SDE direction. This is a useful idea and I find the authors' empirical demonstrations of its relevance compelling."
