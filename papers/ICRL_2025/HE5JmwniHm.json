    "title": "DLEFT-MKC: Dynamic Late Fusion Multiple Kernel Clustering with Robust Tensor Learning via Min-Max Optimizaiton",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multiple kernel clustering (MKC) have highlighted the effectiveness of late fusion strategies, particularly in enhancing computational efficiency to near-linear complexity while achieving promising clustering performance. However, existing methods encounter three significant limitations: (1) reliance on fixed base partition matrices that do not adaptively optimize during the clustering process, thereby constraining their performance to the inherent representational capabilities of these matrices; (2) a focus on adjusting kernel weights to explore inter-view consistency and complementarity, which often neglects the intrinsic high-order correlations among views, thereby limiting the extraction of comprehensive multiple kernel information; (3) a lack of adaptive mechanisms to accommodate varying distributions within the data, which limits robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm termed Dynamic Late Fusion Multiple Kernel Clustering with Robust {Tensor Learning via min-max optimization (DLEFT-MKC), which effectively overcomes the representational bottleneck of base partition matrices and facilitates the learning of meaningful high-order cross-view information. Specifically, it is the first to incorporate a min-max optimization paradigm into tensor-based MKC, enhancing algorithm robustness and generalization. Additionally, it dynamically reconstructs decision layers to enhance representation capabilities and subsequently stacks the reconstructed representations for tensor learning that promotes the capture of high-order associations and cluster structures across views, ultimately yielding consensus clustering partitions. To solve the resultant optimization problem, we innovatively design a strategy that combines reduced gradient descent with the alternating direction method of multipliers, ensuring convergence to local optima while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results across various benchmark datasets validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DLEFT-MKC.",

                "value": "The paper presents a dynamic late fusion multiple kernel clustering with robust tensor learning via min-max optimization, named DLEFT-MKC. The proposed method aims to address the robustness and generalization problem via a min-max objective. It utilizes t-TNN constraints to explore the high-order relationships and cluster structures between views. The unstable performance caused by the base partition matrices is mitigated by the dynamically adjusted partition matrices. Additionally, late fusion is introduced to reduce its computational complexity. These modules help enhance the clustering performance. The authors also conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DLEFT-MKC in terms of performance and time cost."

Leveraging tensor learning for multi-view clustering result fusion is not a novel idea, which has been utilized in many previous works. The main contribution of the work lies in the min-max optimization, which has also adopted by some previous works. Therefore, the novelty of the work might not be so convincing."

Does it mean less sensitivity to parameters?\n2.\tThe underlying reason explaining the min-max optimization\u2019s positive effect on robustness should be better explained.\n3.\tEq. (4), $\\gamma_p$ is used to balance the effect of each view, while in Eq. (6), $\\gamma_p^2$ is adopted. We notice that the constraints on $\\gamma_p$ in Eq. (4) and Eq. (6) remain the same, but why Eq. (6) adopts $\\gamma_p^2$ instead?\n4.\tThough DLEFT-MKC is a late fusion approach, it is based on the third-order tensor and updating tensor requires t-SVD which is time-consuming. So why it has lower running on several datasets compared with other late fusion-based methods like OPLFMVC and LFMVC."

The case where $\\gamma_p = 0$ and $\\Delta \\leq 0$ is missing from the discussion in Eq.(14).\n3. There is insufficient discussion on the proposed algorithm. The objective expression appears complex, and the max-min-max form raises questions about how it ensures rapid convergence. While the experimental results show a notable improvement in computational efficiency compared to most other algorithms, there is a lack of analysis on computational complexity to explain this phenomenon.\n4. The cluster assignments in Fig.2 are not easily distinguishable, which is insufficient to validate the effectiveness of the learning process. The authors should provide additional visualizations to substantiate this contribution. For example, on the Reuters dataset, most algorithms achieve an average accuracy around 45%, whereas the proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 97%. Such a high accuracy rate raises concerns, and the authors need to provide an explanation.\n5. The author should provide the code and sufficient information for readers to reproduce the experimental results."
