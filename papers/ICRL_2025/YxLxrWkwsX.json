    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the field of novel view synthesis, yet their generalization across diverse scenes and conditions remains challenging. Addressing this, we propose the integration of a novel brain-inspired normalization technique Neural Generalization (NeuGen) into leading NeRF architectures which include MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF. NeuGen extracts domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the models' generalization capabilities. It can be seamlessly integrated into NeRF architectures, capable of initiating training from scratch or fine-tuning pre-trained models, which cultivates a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves accuracy and robustness in image rendering. Through this integration, NeuGen shows benchmarking performance on diverse datasets across state-of-the-art NeRF architectures, enabling them to generalize better across varied scenes. Our comprehensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, confirm that our approach not only surpasses existing models in generalizability but also markedly improves rendering quality. Our work exemplifies the potential of merging neuroscientific principles with deep learning frameworks, setting a new precedent for enhanced generalizability and efficiency in novel view synthesis. A demo of our study is available at https://neugennerf.github.io.",

                "value": "This work introduces Neural Generalization as a layer to extract the domain-invariant feature from the original 2D image. Then, this work fuses the domain-invariant representation with the original image representation through a simple channel0wise addition operation.  This work validates their methods in two scenarios, including per-scene fine-tuning and no fine-tuning. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of their proposed NeuGen."

In my understanding, the general scenarios for NeRF might cover different scenes, including different architecture or different textures. However, the NeuGen is like an easy high-frequency filtering operation, which can obviate the interferences from different textures.  The same principle has been validated in the classification task for DG. Therefore, I am concerned if you substitute your NeuGen with high-frequency filtering, it can achieve the same results. \n\n3. Moreover, the generalization setting is somehow hard to understand. If my understanding is right, your model is robust to different scenes? (Actually a universal case instead of a generalization case in other fields). Your backbone used for rendering can also achieve generalizable NeRF. Therefore, the proposed NeuGen is not only specifically designed for generalization cases but also works for fine-tuning scenarios. In other words. why not present your work from NeRF itself instead of a domain generalization perspective? I cannot identify the definition of \"domain\" in this task actually."

The second question is about the differences between NeuGen with existing high-frequency extraction operations. How about the effects of them. \n\n3. Can you provide more theoretical analysis for why adding the high-frequency information can improve the rendering capability/generalization capability? \n\n4. Whether the testing examples have been observed by your general model?\n\n5. Whether the generalization in this work denotes the universal?"

It would be beneficial to refer and build on the decades of works that has been done on edge processing and frequency content for image processing.\n\n3- Because of the previous point, it would be interesting to evaluate other edge detection methods and the influence of the frequency modification on the results.\n\n4- Because of the above 2 points, it is very likely that the impact on performance (+ or -) would depend on the quality of the images at the first place (e.g. image windowing, noise, resolution,\u2026). This is only briefly touched in the paper when comparing and discussing results between the different datasets, but not tested in a rigorous  way. \n\n5- NeRF are unlikely to replicate brain mechanics, so the argument that the proposed approach is beneficial because similar to how part of the brain seem to process raw images is not super relevant, and therefore raises the questions whether other edge enhancement methods might work better.\n\n6- MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF already include some convolution layers, so it can potentially learn any preprocessing filter, which might be edge enhancing. It would be interesting to investigate if this is the case, and whether the proposed approach would benefit more basic NeRF or other implicit method which do not include any spatial filters."

While NeuGen shows notable improvements in synthetic data, its quantitative gains (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) on in-the-wild data remain modest.\n\n4. Comparisons with related works, such as NeRFLiX (CVPR 2023), GMT (ECCV 2024), and RoGUENeRF (ECCV 2024), which also aim to improve NeRF-based novel view synthesis, could add depth to the analysis.\n\n5.

Could it be that the authors are using this idea more for narrative appeal than as a genuine basis for their design?\n\n2. There is a lack of detailed speed comparisons or structural diagrams. For instance, in Line 268, where \"deep 2D CNN\" is mentioned, and in Line 280, where \"Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)\" is referenced, the specific structures of these components are unclear. It would be helpful if the authors could illustrate them with schematic diagrams or similar visuals. Additionally, this extra network branch will certainly introduce additional computational overhead, such as increased FLOPs. The authors should discuss this aspect in more detail.\n\n3. The generalized NeRF methods used and discussed by the authors are mostly earlier works. More recent works, such as MuRF [1], could also be discussed or serve as an up-to-date baselines, which would make the results more convincing.\n\n\n[1]. MuRF: Multi-Baseline Radiance Fields.
