    "title": "Private Wasserstein Distance",
    "abstract": "Wasserstein distance is a key metric for quantifying data divergence from a distributional perspective. However, its application in privacy-sensitive environments, where direct sharing of raw data is prohibited, presents significant challenges. Existing approaches, such as Differential Privacy and Federated Optimization, have been employed to estimate the Wasserstein distance under such constraints. However, these methods often fall short when both accuracy and security are required. In this study, we explore the inherent triangular properties within the Wasserstein space, leading to a novel solution named $\\texttt{TriangleWad}$. This approach facilitates the fast computation of the Wasserstein distance between datasets stored across different entities, ensuring that raw data remain completely hidden. TriangleWad not only strengthens resistance to potential attacks but also preserves high estimation accuracy.\nThrough extensive experiments across various tasks involving both image and text data, we demonstrate its superior performance and significant potential for real-world applications.",

                "value": "The paper discusses a distributed method to estimate the Wasserstein distance between a source and (possibly several) target distributions. This problem finds applications in data valuation, and domain adaptation and selection (among others). The paper considers the data privacy of individual parties involved and describes an attack on the prior work which requires interpolation between target and source distributions. The paper then proposes a method to improve upon this, by instead sharing interpolations with a random gaussian distribution. The proposed method improves on prior work performance while providing a symmetric interface for all parties involved."

For instance, there are gaps between related questions and concerns (3.4 and then again 4.2.1), while a list of interesting but flow-breaking applications appear in the middle Section 3.5.\n\n- Claims of improved privacy are not substantiated very well. The paper recognizes the issues with privacy claims but the arguments provided do not assuage validity concerns (empirical results are not proof of privacy). For instance\n\n\t- I think an attack similar to what authors present against FedWad (in Section 3.2)\n\t  to learn $\\mu$ from $\\nu$ is possible. In fact, it seems the whole security argument comes from lack of iterations, and not the fundamental design of the proposed solution in Section 3.3  \n  \n\t\t-\n\t\t  > Page 8: TriangleWad does not calculate any interpolating measure between \u00b5 and \u03bd, so the attacker can not use available information to identify the distribution of the raw data.  \n  \n\t\t    \n\t\t  This is a pretty weak argument. There are other pieces of shared information that the attacker can use. Including the shared $\\gamma$ , and the fact that good performance is only possible when both parties have the same $t$ shows a pretty strong utility-privacy trade-off  \n  \n\t-\n\t  > 3.4 APPROXIMATE WASSERSTEIN DISTANCE WITH UNKNOWN t  \n  \n\t\t- The arguments in Section 3.4 are not satisfying in hiding the $t$ parameter. To me the only way to prove such a result, is to show that inverting (10) is not possible (which I have strong doubts on)\n\n\t\t- I do not have a concrete proof, but I believe you can construct seller distributions $\\eta_{\\nu_i} (s_j)$ such that you can invert the relationship can find $t_0$\n\n- The formal presentation of the paper can be considerably improved. For instance,\n\n\t-\n\t  > Page 5: and it has a negative relationship with k  \n  \n\t\t- What does this mean in a formal proof?\n\n\t- Undefined Notation in $f_l^{\\star}$ in eq.13.

The high level idea of the proposed algorithm is inspired by similar triangles: Let two datasets considered be \\mu and \\nu, we pick an arbitrary dataset \\gamma, if \\eta_{\\mu}(t) is a linear interpolation between \\mu and \\gamma (i.e., t * \\mu + (1-t) * \\gamma), and \\eta_{\\nu}(t) is defined similarly, then (distance between \\eta_{\\mu}(t) and \\eta_{\\nu}(t))/t is a good approximation to the distance between \\mu and \\nu. The paper also shows that if two parties use different t, how do they get the approximation. In addition, the paper also proves that: given the information, the dataset distribution of one party is impossible to be reconstructed by the other."

As far as I can infer, the intended privacy model is whether one party's data can be almost completely reconstructed. For the intended applications of federated learning or data market quality checks, that may be a very weak guarantee, as partial reconstruction of some records may be a significant breach (like in a medical database). Since one has to share an interpolating distribution (line 290), the choice of interpolated data points and coefficients (Eq 4) may leak significant information (for example it can be used to estimate t). To pass the bar, this paper needs a privacy model that is appropriate to its intended applications.\n\nAnother weakness is the paper is incredibly difficult to read. Some parts are notation-dense while other parts are handwavy. The notation is not always used consistently and not always defined. As a result, I may have not entirely understood everything. Examples include:\n- #pi in Line 108\n- Theorem 1 is not self-contained (for instance it doesn't define gamma or introduce sigma, so you have to keep looking elsewhere), the dependence of C on k is omitted in the big-O notation and is replaced by the vague non-quantitative \"is negatively related to\"\n- The paper keeps switching between W, W_p, W^2 in an inconsistent use of notation. As p=2, there is no generality afforded by using p in the notation anywhere in the paper.\n- Eq 9 sigma(pi*....) does not appear to be defined.\n- Is corollary 2 missing text? Is it supposed to start as \"Suppose each element of eta(mu) ...\" or is there some other meaning to it?\n- Corollary 1 appears to contradict the preceding discussion. First,  \"hat{W}_p(mu, nu) is an unbiased estimation \" of what? of W(mu, nu)?
