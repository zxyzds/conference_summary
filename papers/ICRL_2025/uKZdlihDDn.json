    "title": "Learning Distributions of Complex Fluid Simulations with Diffusion Graph Networks",
    "abstract": "Physical systems with complex unsteady dynamics, such as fluid flows, are often poorly represented by a single mean solution. For many practical applications, it is crucial to access the full distribution of possible states, from which relevant statistics (e.g., RMS and two-point correlations) can be derived. Here, we propose a graph-based latent diffusion model that enables direct sampling of states from their equilibrium distribution, given a mesh discretization of the system and its physical parameters. This allows for the efficient computation of flow statistics without running long and expensive numerical simulations. The graph-based structure enables operations on unstructured meshes, which is critical for representing complex geometries with spatially localized high gradients, while latent-space diffusion modeling with a multi-scale GNN allows for efficient learning and inference of entire distributions of solutions. A key finding of our work is that the proposed networks can accurately learn full distributions even when trained on incomplete data from relatively short simulations. We apply this method to a range of fluid dynamics tasks, such as predicting pressure distributions on 3D wing models in turbulent flow, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging scenarios. The ability to directly sample accurate solutions, and capturing their diversity from short ground-truth simulations, is highly promising for complex scientific modeling tasks.",

                "value": "For many fluid dynamics problems, the exact trajectory dynamics are not relevant; instead, domain scientists are more concerned with quantities of interest that arise from steady state distributions. The paper proposes a multi-scale GNN architecture contextualized within the DDPM framework. Similar to prior and current state-of-the-art diffusion models, the work uses a latent representation, instead of performing diffusion over the original data space. In order to differentiate between both contributions, experiments are performed on both DGNs (Diffusion Graph Networks) and LDGNs (Latent Diffusion Graph Networks).\n\nExperiments are performed on 3 experimental settings: 1) pressure on the wall of an ellipse in 2D laminar flow 2) velocity and pressure around the ellipse 3) pressure on a 3D wing. The baselines include a Bayesian GNN, a Gaussian mixture model, a Gaussian regression model, and a VAE."

                "value": "This paper presents two graph-based diffusion models for generating equilibrium states of fluid dynamics systems: one employing diffusion in physical space and another in the latent space generated by graph encoders. The presentation is clear and the methodological choices appear well-reasoned, particularly the use of multi-scale GNN as an encoder to support the latent diffusion model. The approach shows promise for generalization to broader applications where steady state prediction is needed.\n\nWhile technically sound, the primary limitation lies in the methodology's originality. The work largely assembles existing methods rather than introducing novel techniques, though this integration is done throughoutly.\n\nI assumed two important references should also be included and addressed to help with the literature review of this paper.\n\n1. \"Direct Prediction of Steady-State Flow Fields in Meshed Domain with Graph Networks\" should be included as a baseline:\n    - it directly addresses steady-state flow prediction using GNNs. This leads me to question when we should prefer deterministic versus generative approaches.\n    - I can see their generative method working well when \"steady states\" show variations (like the periodic wakes in von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortices), but for cases with strictly stationary steady states - like this paper's ellipse and airfoil examples - wouldn't a deterministic approach make more sense?\n    - I'd strongly encourage the authors to include this baseline and run comparative experiments and discuss these trade-offs based on results\n\n2. \"Efficient Learning of Mesh-Based Physical Simulation with Bi-Stride Multi-Scale Graph Neural Network,\" which shares similar ideas about multi-scale GNN architecture and more importantly an automatic graph hierarchy construction.\n    - Frankly, compared to a refered paper in the current manuscript: (Fortunato 2022) which requires manual drawing of coarsen layer, this paper's automatic graph hierarchy construction is closer pipeline-wise. Hence I think it should be acknowledged in the related work, and the related method paragraphs.\n    - While I don't think they need to conduct ablation studies here, as it's not the main focus, mentioning it would strengthen their literature review.\n\nI recommend a borderline accept for this paper now. I would consider improving my score if the authors address these missing references, and if they add the suggested baseline and the comparative analysis between deterministic and generative approaches, and thoroughly discuss when each method works best."
