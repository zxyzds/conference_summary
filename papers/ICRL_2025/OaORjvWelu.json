    "abstract": "Alignment is a critical step in large language model (LLM) post-training. It typically requires human annotations to align the model's output to human preferences, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce the alignment cost.\n Specifically, we consider multiple levels of alignment with different qualities and response-generating costs, which we refer to as multi-fidelity alignment. We develop a new approach to incorporating the varying levels of response quality to train a language model, aiming to reduce the cost of response collection for alignment while maintaining the performance of the language model. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results to support the effectiveness of the proposed multi-fidelity alignment approach. Lastly, we conduct experiments to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing its performance with the vanilla alignment methods.",

The authors call this \"multi-fidelity\" alignment. A high fidelity alignment is of better quality or accuracy (and cost) than a low fidelity alignment. The paper present a mathematical formulation of the WinRate metric used in preference training, and a theoretical analysis for the cost complexity upper bound of the multi-fidelity alignment algorithm."

The text should be rephrased to make this distinction more clear in Section 5. Furthermore, it is difficult to appreciate the results without some context on the choice of the dataset used for the experiments. There is no meaningful comparison with previous work which also makes it difficult to put the results in context."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My major concerns are as follows:\n\nThe paper generates DPO datasets using an iterative scheme across various alignment models, as demonstrated in Algorithm 2, and subsequently uses this dataset to train an LLM to achieve performance gains. However, how can the authors ensure that these performance improvements stem from the proposed theory? This process appears more akin to knowledge distillation or data synthesis. Furthermore, while the paper claims to achieve a \u201cweak-to-strong\u201d result, it inadequately elucidates the implications of this transformation within the alignment process.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper's aims are unclear. If the goal is to enhance \u201cweak-to-strong\u201d generalization, the authors should provide further exploration of this aspect. Conversely, if the aim is to improve alignment through multi-fidelity LLMs, a more detailed analysis comparing this approach to related works, such as knowledge distillation and data synthesis, would be beneficial.\n\nOther comments:\n\n1) This approach employs a strategy of guiding model training using a hierarchy of weak to strong models. However, one of the research goals this paper is to minimize the overhead associated with obtaining a response. Introducing decoding operations for external models may, in fact, increase this overhead, yet there are no experiments provided that demonstrate a reduction in overhead.\n\n2) The authors opted to use three distinct series of models in their experiments. However, to more clearly distinguish performance differences, it would be more effective to utilize various sizes or versions of the same model series.\n\n3) The algorithmic process presented in this paper involves successively selecting models from weak to strong to generate responses, comparing these with the responses of the training models to derive preference data, and subsequently conducting DPO training. The efficacy of this staged training process, which selects models in a weak-to-strong manner, requires validation through ablation experiments.\n\n4) The paper currently lacks sufficient baselines. The authors should incorporate additional baseline experiments, such as DPO with publicly available or human-annotated datasets, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, testing the final model on widely recognized benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval, would improve the robustness of the evaluation."
