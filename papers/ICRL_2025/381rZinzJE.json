    "title": "Physics-Informed Autoencoder for Enhancing Data Quality to Improve the Forecasting Reliability of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Agricultural Fields",
    "abstract": "Missing values in measurements for carbon dioxide emissions on drained peatlands remains an open challenge for training forecasting techniques to achieve net zero. At the field scale, existing methods struggle to model $\\ce{CO_2}$ emissions to fill gaps, especially in nighttime measurements. We propose robust Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAEs), which combine the generative capabilities of Autoencoders with the reliability of physical models of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) that quantify $\\ce{CO_2}$ exchanges between the atmosphere and major carbon pools. Our method integrates equations describing the physical processes and associated uncertainties to fill gaps in NEE measurements from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. In the PIAE, various sensor measurements are encoded into the latent space, and a set of decoders is then used to approximate the ecosystem parameters and the optimal NEE forecast, directed by dynamics described by a stochastic differential equation. These decoders utilize nighttime and daytime NEE models that describe carbon transfer as a Wiener process. Finally, we use a two-phased training routine with two loss functions describing each phase: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the measurements and the reconstructed samples. PIAE outperforms the current state-of-the-art Random Forest Robust on the prediction of nighttime NEE measurements on various distribution-based and data-fitting metrics. We present significant improvement in capturing temporal trends in the NEE at daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly scales.",

According to both of them, the noise term can be defined as a Gaussian process.  The drift equations in Equation 5 are derived from the model defined in Equations 1,2 and 3. The parameters inside the drift term are predicted by the decoders in the main PIAE model, described in section 4 later. \nIs your question specifically around the parameters \u03c3night and \u03c3day in the noise term and the drift?

It is then hard for me to judge the significance, originality and potential impact of the work.\n More precisely, these are some points that are not sufficiently explained or that make the paper hard to read and understand:\n- In the introduction, it is mentioned that missing NEE values are due to e.g. power shortages. I assume that in such scenarios, the values of the covariates (temperature, radiation, etc) are also missing due to the same issue. However, the proposed model requires having access to all covariate values at a given time. How can the model be applied in practice without these values?\n- In the introduction, the first highlighted contribution is the introduction of a SDE for NEE measurements. Put it that way, it sounds like the SDE is novel also in the physics. However this point is not stressed again later on, so I wonder whether the SDE is known and the novelty is in its use as supervision for learning ML models.\n- Line 157, it is mentioned that the $E_0$ parameter is estimated with the nighttime model and used in the daytime one, but it is not explained why.\n- In section 4.4, it is mentioned that the integration of the SDE in the training of the autoencoder follows previous work [Raissi 2017], but it is not sufficiently described to make the paper self-contained.\n- The related work is not sufficiently described. In particular, it is not clear whether the reported baselines RFR and XgBoost variant based on the work of [Moffat 2007] are also physics-informed or only statistical.\n- Second and third lines of Equation 5: do the second (from the left) commas separate two different definitions or do they indicate the continuation of the variable suffices?\n\n2.

Consider that multi-letter abbreviations can be confusing in equations: For example, it can be unclear if rb is a single variable or the product of r and b.\n\nrb (night/day) is not defined in the main text as far as I can see. rb is mentioned in the text in the appendix but not in the mathematical derivations.\n\nIn equation 9, should is there not a difference between dt on the left and right hand side? On the left hand side, it seems to denote an infinitessimal element, and on the right side it is 30 minutes?\n\nI am not sure how this approach is an autoencoder. As I understand the written description, the model predicts one timestep ahead with a latent encoding, and thus does forecasting rather than reconstruction. However, Figure 1 does seem to imply that the decoders predict for the same timestep.\n\nIs there something wrong with the linebreaks in Algorithm 1, step 4?\n\nWhat is the reason for the choice of the two loss phases?\n\nI am not familiar with the literature on physics-informed autoencoders, but I would like to ask whether this paper introduces any technical contributions to the framework itself, or if the contribution is primarily the application of an existing modeling framework to significant applications."

But, based on the loss function, two samples are from the same realization, just one is the data and the other is a model prediction. If they are from the same realization ($\\omega^j$ in author's notation), minimizing the distance would make more sense, like the first phase of the training. In the end of day, for two samples from the same realization, minimizing MMD corresponds to minimizing MSE. But, all the hyperparameters (like the RBF kernel) makes it much less straightforward."
