    "title": "Trajectory-LLM: A Language-based Data Generator for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Vehicle trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving, which requires extensive trajectory data to train prediction models to understand the complex, varied, and unpredictable patterns of vehicular interactions. However, acquiring real-world data is expensive, so we advocate using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate abundant and realistic trajectories of interacting vehicles efficiently. These models rely on textual descriptions of vehicle-to-vehicle interactions on a map to produce the trajectories. We introduce Trajectory-LLM (Traj-LLM), a new approach that takes brief descriptions of vehicular interactions as input and generates corresponding trajectories. Unlike language-based approaches that translate text directly to trajectories, Traj-LLM uses reasonable driving behaviors to align the vehicle trajectories with the text. This results in an \"interaction-behavior-trajectory\" translation process. We have also created a new dataset, Language-to-Trajectory (L2T), which includes 240K textual descriptions of vehicle interactions and behaviors, each paired with corresponding map topologies and vehicle trajectory segments. By leveraging the L2T dataset, Traj-LLM can adapt interactive trajectories to diverse map topologies. Furthermore, Traj-LLM generates additional data that enhances downstream prediction models, leading to consistent performance improvements across public benchmarks.",

                "value": "This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate trajectories for autonomous driving by introducing an interaction-behavior-trajectory translation approach, rather than the commonly used interaction-trajectory translation in other LLM-based methods. Their approach consists of two stages: in the first, vehicle interaction descriptions are translated into behaviors, and in the second, these behaviors are converted into specific motion parameters to create trajectories. Additionally, the authors developed a new Language-to-Trajectory (L2T) dataset. Their method demonstrates promising performance on both the L2T and Waymo Motion Prediction datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

Firstly, it only selects the WOMD dataset and does not test on other representative datasets, such as Argoverse. Secondly, it only uses mAP as the metric, neglecting other common metrics such as distance error and miss rate. Therefore, the generalizability of the proposed method remains questionable.\n3. Training a generative model on a third-party dataset and then using the generated data for model training\u2014does this yield effects equivalent to training on the original third-party dataset?
