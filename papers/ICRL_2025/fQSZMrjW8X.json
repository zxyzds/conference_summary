    "title": "LocDiffusion: Identifying Locations on Earth by Diffusing in the Hilbert Space",
    "abstract": "Image geolocalization is a fundamental yet challenging task, aiming at inferring the geolocation on Earth where an image is taken. Existing methods approach it either via grid-based classification or via image retrieval. The geolocalization accuracy of these methods is constrained by the choice of geographic grid cell sizes or the spatial distributions of the retrieval image/geolocation gallery, and\ntheir performance significantly suffers when the spatial distribution of test images does not align with such choices. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage diffusion models to achieve image geolocalization with arbitrary resolutions. To avoid the problematic manifold reprojection step in diffusion, we developed a novel spherical positional encoding-decoding framework, which encodes points on a spherical surface (e.g., geolocations on Earth) into a Hilbert space of Spherical Harmonics coefficients and decodes points (geolocations) by mode-seeking. We call this type of position encoding Spherical Harmonics Dirac Delta (SHDD) Representation. We also propose a novel SirenNet-based architecture called CS-UNet to learn the conditional backward process in the latent SHDD space by minimizing a latent KL-divergence loss. We train a conditional latent diffusion model called LocDiffusion that generates geolocations under the guidance of images \u2013 to the best of our knowledge, the first generative model to address the image geolocalization problem. We evaluate our LocDiffusion model against SOTA image geolocalization baselines. LocDiffusion achieves competitive geolocalization performance and demonstrates significantly stronger generalizability to unseen geolocations.",

In Table 1, the proposed method achieves the best results in 5 out of 10 categories across two benchmarks, but the improvements are marginal, with differences of less than 0.5. Additionally, the method significantly underperforms in key categories like Street, City, and Region, raising concerns about its robustness across different geolocalization tasks.\n2. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of computational efficiency, particularly in terms of training and inference speed, compared to existing methods. Since this is the first application of a diffusion model for geolocalization, it is important to understand how it compares to more established models, such as CLIP-based approaches, in terms of scalability and practicality for real-world applications. This could also helping assessing its potential impact and usability."

In Lines 92-93: The paper states, \"Performing diffusion on the XYZ coordinates will likely lead to a point that is not on the spherical surface.\" Can the authors please provide further explanation or supporting evidence for this claim?\n2. In Table 1, the method appears to struggle when the distance is below 1/3 or 1/10 of the spatial threshold in the SHDD representations. Could the authors explain why this occurs, especially given the claim that the model works for images with arbitrary resolutions? Does this limitation suggest the model is better suited for coarse-level geolocalization rather than fine-grained predictions?\n3. Increasing the parameter $L$ seems to have a significant impact on performance. Could the authors provide more details on the computational resources required as $L$ increases? Understanding the trade-offs between computational cost and performance would offer useful insights into the model's scalability."

However, it just only predicts approximate locations, not coordinates. To build such a geographic knowledge base, a huge number of images are needed.\n3.\tI noticed some tricks in preventing overfitting phenomena, such as a very high dropout rate. Please analyze the overfitting of the proposed method.\n4.\tthe advantages of the SHDD representation are primarily presented at a theoretical level, with limited experimental evidence to fully support the claims, without more experiments or analysis. By the way, there are only three tables in the entire paper, and one of them is still or just an experimental setup. There is no experimental-level evidence of the advantages of model and only a minor improvement in the main experiment.\n5.\tAs shown in Table 1, in YFCC-26k, GeoDecoder has better performance than GeoCLIP in City 25km. I would recommend labeling the strong petitory and marking the improvement over them. Why is the performance so defective in 1km and 25km? The increase in generalization ability is built at the expense of model accuracy, which is hard to accept. I understand the need for generalization ability for this task, but I can only assume that for the previous models are flawed in solving the fitting problem. If the main purpose of this paper is in addressing the generalization ability, it would be more appropriate to analyze this aspect or collect an open-world test set to validate the model."

Notably, Table 1 shows that it does not outperform approaches from 2016/2017 for low-error thresholds. The challenge is the computational complexity and memory consumption of the proposed approach. While promising, I'd need to see solid evidence that it improves relative to more straightforward approaches.\n\n- L282 seems to be the crux of the problem with this approach, the assumption that the space is infinite. In practical implementations this is truncated, but it's unclear that this space is then the optimal space for the task. Existing approaches allow more data-driven specification of the space (for example, choosing spatial partitioning based on the distribution of the training dataset or implicitly based on the distribution of the gallery).\n\n- L509 makes the claim that retrieval approaches depend heavily on the quality of the gallery, and seems to frame this as a negative. This is similar to saying, \"the problem with the ImageNet dataset is that it requires so many images to represent the classes\". Of course that's true; we always would love to use fewer images, but it's unclear how the proposed approach overcomes this issue. It still needs a large training dataset to fit the target function and these training images can serve as gallery images. There's clearly a negative to a large gallery, but in practice, it's easy to create indexes across billions of image embeddings using existing libraries. This scales well for practical uses.\n\n- Some previous works have proposed strategies for overcoming the resolution limitations imposed by binning and a small gallery. This includes kernel density estimation in Revisiting IM2GPS in the Deep Learning Era by Nam Vo et al. A more complete assessment of previous attempts at addressing this issue should be included and an evaluation of simpler strategies should be included. Those missing baselines would likely be simpler to implement and might not suffer from the same memory challenges.\n\n- Important related work is missing from CVPR 2024: \"PIGEON: Predicting Image Geolocations\" by Haas et al. This work proposes a hybrid of classification and retrieval which outperforms the results shown in Table 1 across the board. It notably does not generate poor results for low-error thresholds (which are the settings that most use cases require)."

For example, I found myself skipping over Section 4.1 because it felt like it was being overly mathy without any strong motivation.\n  - I'd suggest for a future submission that the authors consider bringing Figure 2 to the forefront and emphasizing the high-level implementation before delving into the detailed mathematics.\n  - Figure 1 has the longest caption I've ever seen in a CV/AI/ML paper. Many of those details would have been better presented after the high-level algorithm was clear as opposed to so early in the paper.\n  - I find the heavy use of footnotes to be a bad sign for the writing of a paper.
