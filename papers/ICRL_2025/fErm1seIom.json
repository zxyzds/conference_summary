    "title": "FMP-AE: A HYBRID APPROACH TO TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series presents significant challenges, particularly due to the lack of clear criteria and the prevalence of highly imbalanced data. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods often struggle with low recall rates and computational inefficiency. While deep learning techniques offer the advantage of automatic feature extraction, they are also affected by the issue of data imbalance. This paper introduces an integrated time series anomaly detection model, Feature map Matrix Profile with an AutoEncoder (FMP-AE), which combines matrix profile structures with deep learning techniques. The model leverages a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to extract features and compute the matrix profile. Then a novel Matrix Profile loss function is defined and integrated with the Autoencoder's reconstruction loss for model training and anomaly detection. Experimental results on the UCR250 benchmark datasets highlight the model's impressive performance, showing notable success across various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. These findings indicate that the hybrid FMP-AE model, significantly improves accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency in anomaly detection tasks.",

                "value": "1. Incremental Methodological Innovation: While combining Matrix Profile (MP) with Autoencoder reconstruction loss is practical, it mainly builds on existing methods without substantial theoretical innovation. The A.2 Loss Function section explains how this combination may enhance anomaly detection but lacks deeper theoretical justification for why MP loss would improve sensitivity beyond reconstruction loss alone. The explanation is largely empirical, without rigorous theoretical support to clarify this enhancement mechanism.\n\n2. Restricted Dataset Evaluation and Generalizability Concerns: The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, UCR250, which restricts insights into FMP-AE\u2019s applicability across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore, there is no theoretical justification for the combined loss function, making it unclear whether the observed improvements generalize beyond this dataset. Expanding the evaluation to include more varied datasets or providing theoretical analysis could help validate the model\u2019s robustness and adaptability.\n\n3. Comparison with Outdated Baselines: The baseline methods used for comparison are primarily from 2022 or earlier, omitting more recent approaches in anomaly detection. This limits the assessment of FMP-AE\u2019s competitiveness against the latest advancements in the field, making it difficult to gauge how the proposed method stands relative to state-of-the-art techniques. A comparison with newer methods would provide a clearer picture of FMP-AE\u2019s effectiveness within the current landscape."

Additional experiments on varied time series data would help clarify the model\u2019s robustness and adaptability.\n\n3.\tWhy were no post-2022 methods included in the baseline comparisons? Would a comparison with more recent techniques clarify FMP-AE\u2019s standing within the current anomaly detection landscape?"

The author's focus should be on TSAD (Time-Series Anomaly Detection) rather than general anomaly detection. Therefore, the introduction should be revised. Additionally, it should explain why past methods face challenges and what their deficiencies are.\n2. The ablation experiment lacks analysis of 1D-CNN + AE.\n3. The analysis in the ablation experiment part lacks some more valuable conclusions. It should not be just a simple comparison of the performance of different methods.\n4. Figure 4 does not show the original time series and abnormal regions, making it difficult to understand the pros and cons of different losses. Moreover, necessary analysis is lacking.\n5. Figures 5 and 6 lack analysis, making it impossible to understand the analysis results of Figure 5. The significance of Figure 6 is unclear, and it is impossible to know the analyzed object and results.\n6. The analysis conclusion of Figure 7 seems to overlap with the previous ones and lacks more insightful conclusions. At the same time, there is no comparison with other methods, lacking persuasiveness.\n7. Figures 4-7 do not indicate on what data the experiments are conducted and there is no comparison with other methods.\n8. In setting up comparison methods, recent works such as NPSR, SimAD, D3R, LLM and other models are lacking.\n9. Figure 10 is difficult to understand, with a large amount of blank time series.\n10. The author does not analyze from the experimental and theoretical levels why their method can solve existing challenges.\n11. There is a lack of necessary comparison of space-time complexity and algorithm time consumption, making it impossible to effectively prove that the author's proposed algorithm is efficient.\n12. The author only validates on one dataset, UCR, lacking mainstream datasets in the current TSAD community such as MSL, SMAP, SMD, etc. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of the algorithm under complex conditions.\n13. There is a lack of analysis of the classic Matrix Profile algorithm. What would be the performance if features are obtained using TCN or MLP and then the classic MP is used?\n14. The author's experimental organization is not good enough and does not effectively verify the motivation of their algorithm.\n15. I suggest that the author open source the code for follow-up research."

The method is quite easy and straightforward. It uses CNN to extract features of time series, and uses MP to compute similarity between subsequences. These are well-known techiniques.\n3.

However, the authors only claim that the proposed method is more efficient by introducing matrix profile. The other two challenges is not solved by the proposed method. Also, it is not clear why matrix profile combining with an auto-encoder can improve the method efficiency compared with a solely auto-encoder.\n2. Unpersuasive experiments. On one hand, the proposed methods do not compare with the most SOTA methods, for example [1] [2] [3]. The latest method included in baseline is published in 2022. On the other hand, since the authors claimed that introducing matrix profile can improve method efficiency in their contributions, they should also have made experiment to prove it. However, this aspect is not discussed thoroughly in experiment.\n3. Limited contribution. There are mainly two part in the proposed method: one is matrix profile and another is an auto-encoder. The structure of auto-encoder is really common by combining max-pool and CNN. The matrix profile may be somewhat novel, but it is a really marginal improvement.\n4. Misunderstanding of the shortage of deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods. In the abstract, the authors claimed that deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods is affected by data imbalance problem. Actually, many unsupervised deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods assume there are fewer anomalous samples in training set, so that when training by it, the model can better fit the normal pattern rather than anomalous one. Thus, deep-learning-based anomaly detection method actually benefit from those data imbalance.\n\n[1] Yang Y, Zhang C, Zhou T, et al.
