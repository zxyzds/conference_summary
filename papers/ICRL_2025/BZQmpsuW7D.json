    "title": "SPARK: Physics-Guided Quantitative Augmentation for Dynamical System Modeling",
    "abstract": "In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods have a solid theoretical foundation but are limited by high computational costs and sensitivity to initial conditions. Current data-driven approaches use deep learning models to capture complex spatiotemporal features, but they rely heavily on large amounts of data and assume a stable data distribution, making them ineffective against data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantized augmentation plugin. SPARK integrates boundary information and physical parameters, using a reconstruction autoencoder to build a physics-rich discrete memory bank for data compression. It then enhances selected samples for downstream tasks with this pre-trained memory bank. SPARK then utilizes an attention mechanism to model historical observations and combines fourier-enhanced graph ODE to efficiently predict long-term dynamical systems, enhancing robustness and adaptability to complex physical environments. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms various baseline methods in handling distribution shifts and data scarcity.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a new approach to spatiotemporal surrogate modeling. Their approach aims to target some of the limitations of data-driven models as they pertain to distribution shift. The framework, SPARK, combines physics-guided data augmentation and compression to enhance generalization. Key architectural innovations include a discrete memory bank for storing previous physical samples, physical prior and BC incorporation with graph neural nets, and a curriculum learning strategy to incorporate augmented data progressively. SPARK's superior performance is then evaluated on a relatively large suite of benchmark datasets."

The algorithm is not clearly presented. The paper presented reasonable ideas but without enough technical details to tell a clear story. \nMathematical notation is not clearly defined, which makes it hard to follow the method. For example, how is the \"real boundary\" (\"p^{boun}\")represented? Is it a list of spatial coordinates of discrete boundary nodes? Time index does not make sense in section 3.3. For example, T in equation 8 is the length of history observations but then it is also used in loss function in equation 11 to represent the number of future predictive steps, which is confusing. Index notation does not make sense in the pretraining loss equation (6).\n3. It's unclear how the discrete memory bank is built. What are the e_i in E and how are they constructed ?"
