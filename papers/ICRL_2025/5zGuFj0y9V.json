    "title": "Boosting Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation by Revisiting Data Augmentation and Consistency Training",
    "abstract": "The 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is a basic visual problem. However, its supervised learning requires massive keypoint labels, which is labor-intensive to collect. Thus, we aim at boosting a pose estimator by excavating extra unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most previous SSHPE methods are consistency-based and strive to maintain consistent outputs for differently augmented inputs. Under this genre, we find that SSHPE can be boosted from two cores: advanced data augmentations and concise consistency training ways. Specifically, for the first core, we discover the synergistic effects of existing augmentations, and reveal novel paradigms for conveniently producing new superior HPE-oriented augmentations which can more effectively add noise on unlabeled samples. We can therefore establish paired easy-hard augmentations with larger difficulty gaps. For the second core, we propose to repeatedly augment unlabeled images with diverse hard augmentations, and generate multi-path predictions sequentially for optimizing multi-losses in a single network. This simple and compact design is interpretable, and easily benefits from newly found augmentations. Comparing to state-of-the-art SSL approaches, our method brings substantial improvements on public datasets. Code will be released for academic use.",

L.95 introduces a principle \"Do not combine MixUp-related augmentations\" while L.224 P1 claims that \"A global $T_{MU}$ does not make sense for the HPE task.\" It would be better to provide more details. What is the meaning of global? Moreover, it seems mixup is used in some heatmap-based works like [R1], and it works well.\n\n- [R1] From Synthetic to Real: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Animal Pose Estimation. CVPR2021.\n\n2. It would be better to include $T_{CM}$, $T_{CO}$ and $T_{MU}$  in Table 1.\n\n3. Section 3.1 concludes that the rank and the combination of data augmentations are entirely based on empirical studies.  For example, it is easy to understand $T_{A60}$ is harder than $T_{A30}$, but it is not intuitive to understand $T_{JC}$ is harder than $T_{CO}$. I am wondering if any insights or theoretical analysis can be provided to help readers understand more intuitively. For example, L. 228 claims that \"we thus nominate the most likely superior combinations: TJOCO and TJCCM\". The two combinations are useful. However, can we have any insights or principles for other augmentations which not discussed in this paper. It would be meaningful if we can quickly rank any new augmentations. \n\n4.  Section 3.1 did not discusses the parameters of each augmentation. I am not sure the default parameters of each augmentation. Moreover, I am wondering if the parameters will have significant influences on the rank and the combination. For example, Dual-Network (Xie et al., 2021) prefers to use JC 5 and RA 20 to show the parameters directly.\n\n5. Section 5.3 discusses more augmentations and training techniques. But they are not ablation study. It would be better to clearly show the baseline and the effect of each module/strategy.\n\n6. It would be better to show some qualitative results in the main paper or in the supplementary.\n\n7. I am not sure the comparison between the multi-path consistency loss and others is fair enough due to the difference of batch size. It would be better to compare the pair {$I_{e1}$,...,$I_{en}$} + {$I_{h1}$,...,$I_{hn}$} with {$I_{e}$} + {$I_{h1}$,...,$I_{hn}$}, and also discuss the influence of batch size of other SOTA methods.\n\n8.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Limited Novelty\n\nThe proposed method in this paper lacks sufficient novelty and fails to contribute meaningful advancements to the field of semi-supervised human pose estimation (SSHPE). Human pose estimation, as noted, is already a thoroughly researched area with many well-established methods for both data augmentation and consistency training. Specifically, the augmentations Joint Cutout (TJC) and Joint Cut-Occlude\u2014are already known [2]. Similarly, the concept of consistency training has been explored extensively in prior work (e.g., Xie et al., 2021; Moskvyak et al., 2021; Li & Lee, 2023; Huang et al., 2023), reducing the originality of the current approach.\n\nAdditionally, this paper\u2019s methodology appears closely aligned with SSPCM [2], sharing a similar approach to consistency training without offering meaningful differentiation both in terms of novelty and accuracy (Table 3,4). The methods do not extend beyond existing approaches like POST [1], which employs consistency training alongside augmentation but tackles a more complex problem involving significant distribution shifts\u2014something that requires a more robust approach. Given that the paper neither introduces novel methodologies nor demonstrates improvements over current state-of-the-art techniques, its contributions are limited in both theoretical and practical impact. Consequently, the paper falls short in providing sufficient novelty or relevance to warrant further consideration.\n\nThe current approach to selecting augmentations is somewhat rudimentary; exploring more advanced augmentation generation paradigms, such as PoseAug [3], could substantially enhance the contribution by introducing more targeted, pose-specific transformations. To further strengthen the paper\u2019s impact, the authors could also address more complex challenges within semi-supervised human pose estimation, such as managing significant distribution shifts or effectively handling occlusions, both of which would demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed method in diverse and realistic scenarios.\n\n### Lack of experminets\n\nThe proposed method for semi-supervised human pose estimation (SSHPE) would benefit from a deeper comparison with existing foundation models, particularly in a zero-shot setting. For instance, models like Sapiens [4] have demonstrated strong generalization in zero-shot applications, and evaluating the proposed SSHPE approach against such foundation models would clarify its relative strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the paper overlooks a critical experiment involving the use of high-accuracy 3D pose estimation models, such as those utilizing the SMPL model, which effectively parameterizes human poses, handles occlusions, and supports 3D-to-2D projection via camera transformations. Testing whether training a 2D pose estimation model under a semi-supervised setting indeed outperforms simply projecting a state-of-the-art 3D model (e.g., BEDLAM [5], which is trained solely on synthetic data) into 2D, would be crucial in establishing the necessity of the SSHPE approach. Given BEDLAM\u2019s potential for zero-shot 2D projection, it is likely that both Sapiens and BEDLAM could outperform the proposed SSHPE model without additional training.\n\nThese omissions raise an essential question about the need for SSHPE approaches in the presence of robust, generalizable foundation models and accurate 3D pose estimators. To justify the SSHPE setting, it is recommended that the authors add a dedicated section explaining its relevance and necessity. Additionally, expanded experimental results are needed to establish a clear advantage of the proposed method over these established models, particularly to demonstrate that the proposed approach fills a specific gap that existing foundation models and 3D estimators do not.\n\n### Results\n\nLoss Function Effectiveness: Currently, the paper does not provide sufficient insight into the effectiveness of the proposed loss functions,  $\\mathcal{L}_u$  and  $\\mathcal{L}_S$. Including an ablation study to examine the individual impact of these losses on labeled and unlabeled datasets would provide a clearer understanding of their contributions. This would help substantiate the effectiveness of each component and offer more transparency on how these loss functions drive model performance.\n\nComparison with UDA Methods: The semi-supervised setting described shares similarities with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, suggesting a relevant opportunity for comparison. Including benchmark results against state-of-the-art UDA methods, such as UDAPE [6], which leverages consistency loss minimization, would highlight the unique value of the proposed method. Adding these comparisons in Table 4 would show how the approach fares relative to established UDA methods and underscore its novelty and advantage in this space.\n\n### Lack of clarity\nThe paper lacks essential clarity, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the field to follow the methodology and results. Specifically:\n\nUndefined Variables: Key variables such as  $u$, $l$, $N$, and $M$ in lines 181-182 are not clearly defined, which disrupts the reader\u2019s ability to interpret the equations and understand their significance within the proposed method.\n\nUnclear Justification for Downsampled Heatmaps: In line 161, there is a reference to predicting downsampled heatmaps without any clear explanation or citation to support this choice. Given that downsampling can impact resolution and accuracy, it\u2019s essential to provide references to prior methods that utilize this approach and clarify why it\u2019s suitable in this context.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Prior-guided Source-free Domain Adaptation for Human Pose Estimation, ICCV 2023  \n[2] Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation Driven by Position Inconsistency Pseudo Label Correction Module, CVPR 2023  \n[3] PoseAug: A Differentiable Pose Augmentation Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation, CVPR 2021  \n[4] Sapiens: Foundation for Human Vision Models, ECCV 2024  \n[5] BEDLAM: A Synthetic Dataset of Bodies Exhibiting Detailed Lifelike Animated Motion, CVPR 2023  \n[6] A Unified Framework for Domain Adaptive Pose Estimation, ECCV 2022"

For example, selecting combining augmentations in Sec 3.1 does not seem to take out-of-the-box thinking and may be deduced from running a combination of experiments.\n2. Table 4: while the gains are noticeable when using ResNet as the backbone, the same cannot be said for HRNet as the backbone. This raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of using the proposed augmentations and approach. Can the authors justify why choosing a different architecture may not result in a noticeable performance boost? The current results indicate the proposed approach may be architecture-dependent.\n3. Sec 5.2 S3 \u2192 is there a reason the authors do not train for 400 epochs if it is the only other thing besides the number of networks presenting their method from performing not as well as SSPCM?\n4. Table 5: the proposed approach performs similarly to DUAL on the test set. This raises concerns over the generalizability of the method.\n5. Sec 5.2 S1 \u2192 Superior performance on 1 dataset for a small number of samples may not necessarily generalize to using small train sets from other datasets. Is it possible to show results on other datasets, e.g. MPII (which is already evaluated), H3.6, or LSP? Additionally, can the authors justify this statement? The authors state in Dataset Setup that the small subsets of 1K, 5K, and 10K were randomly selected. From the reported numbers, the corresponding baselines do not seem to be trained on the same selected labeled set. It may then be likely (not certainly) that the reported numbers for the proposed approach may be biased towards the evaluation set because of the selected subset for training.\n6.
