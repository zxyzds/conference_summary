    "title": "OCEAN: Online Multi-modal Root Cause Analysis for Microservice Systems",
    "abstract": "Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is essential for pinpointing the root causes of failures in microservice systems. Traditional data-driven RCA methods are typically limited to offline applications due to high computational demands, and existing online RCA methods handle only single-modal data, overlooking complex interactions in multi-modal systems. In this paper, we introduce OCEAN, a novel online multi-modal causal structure learning method for root cause localization. OCEAN employs a dilated convolutional neural network to capture long-term temporal dependencies and graph neural networks to learn causal relationships among system entities and key performance indicators. We further design a multi-factor attention mechanism to analyze and reassess the relationships among different metrics and log indicators/attributes for enhanced online causal graph learning. Additionally, a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module is developed to effectively model the relationships across various modalities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.",

                "value": "The paper introduces the OCEAN framework for online multi-modal root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems, showing significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple real-world datasets. However, it is critiqued for its limited methodological innovation. While the approach achieves good results, it primarily builds on existing techniques, such as dilated convolution, which have been extensively studied in related research. The paper focuses on addressing common challenges in multi-modal learning that have already been explored, rather than tackling the specific and unique challenges of multi-modal RCA. Additionally, it lacks a clear explanation of how its methods enhance real-time processing and reduce resource consumption. Minor issues include inconsistencies in the font of an equation."

                "value": "Limited Innovation and Contribution: While the paper achieves good results, it lacks methodological innovation specifically for online root cause analysis. For example, the core method used to reduce computational time, dilated convolution, has been previously employed. Although the appendix discusses its time complexity in comparison to LSTM and Transformers, paper [1] as early as 2018 introduced the use of dilated convolutional neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies. Furthermore, paper [2] in 2022 utilized this approach specifically for capturing long-term temporal dependencies.\nThe proposed methods primarily address common issues (C1,C2, and C3) in multi-modal learning and do not make substantial progress in tackling the unique challenges of root cause analysis in the multi-modal domain. For example, Method 2, as referenced in the paper, utilizes approaches similar to those in MULAN[3] to extract multi-modal features from offline datasets. However, this paper lacks a detailed explanation of the potential relationships among factors from both modalities and does not clarify why it achieves better results than MULAN. Furthermore, in Method 3, Learning Multi-modal Causal Structures, the paper does not adequately address modality reliability or the reliability of the causal graph, leaving the approach lacking in clear interpretability.\nMotivation Not Clear: The primary novelty of this paper appears to focus on \"online\" multi-modal root cause analysis (RCA) for microservice systems. However, the methodology introduced lacks a clear explanation of how it enhances real-time processing capabilities or reduces resource consumption in practice. The paper proposes the use of dilated convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a graph-based approach but does not sufficiently justify how these choices directly contribute to improved real-time performance or lower computational overhead.\n\u2022Minor Issues: The font in Equation (13) is somewhat inconsistent.\n[1] Borovykh, Anastasia, Sander Bohte, and Cornelis W.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Please clearly define online / offline RCA in introduction. RCA is usually triggered by KPI anomalies. Therefore, it is not a function that needs to be conducted continuously, like anomaly detection. I believe many of the existing works have been deployed in the production system. Are they online RCA methods according to the authors' definition? It is not clear to me that the authors stated that most existing methods are designed for offline use. Methods can be trained offline and used online.\n2. The example in the introduction stating that log is necessary apart from metrics is not convincing. \"Disk Space Full\" can be solely identified by metrics. Regarding \"Database Query Failures\", what specific problem do the authors want to identify? For which kind of system OLTP or OLAP? Why is solely using metrics not enough?\n3. When talking about multi-modal data, the authors metrics and logs, why not consider trace, which seems to be more important for microservice systems. For instance, [1] proposed a method deployed in the production system which considers both metrics and traces and this work is overlooked by the authors.\n4. \"T1\", \"T2\", \"n-1\" and $d_M$ are defined without usage in line 156.\n5. It seems that the authors converted log to metric data. The problem is only defined on metric data. What is the difference between the old metrics and new metrics converted from log? For me, at least the method is only for single modal data. It is not clear why existing single model methods cannot be applied in such a setting.\n6. In the problem definition, the authors ignore the physical relation but propose to use a purely data-driven model to learn the causal structure. Relationships like which service calls the other service, which pod is in which virtual machines and which physical machines, are known but ignored. Can the authors explain the reason behind such a choice? Which practical scenario matches the setting that the authors would like to study?\n7. After reading Section 3, I found that the main focus of the paper is online causal graph learning from time series data. The title and introduction is way broader than the studied problem, which does not match to the content of the paper from my point of view. Moreover, in the microservice setting, why would the causal graph be changing overtime if it is a causal graph reflecting the ground truth? The authors are suggested to better motivate this point.\n8. The proposed model seems to be very complex with several components. How many weights does the model own? How do the authors avoid overfitting and catastrophical forgetting problems during online structure learning?\n9. In Table 2, the proposed method can be used for both metric only and log only settings. The authors are suggested to give both results.\n10. The experimental setting is not clear. Since the proposed method is online, so when will the proposed method be used? What is the batch used for evaluation? And after how batches will the method be evaluated? Again, this confusion may be due to the fact that the online setting is not clearly defined.\n11. It seems that there is no code to reproduce the experiments. In addition, did the authors reproduce the results from other methods or copy the number from their paper? Please give the specific parameter setting or state clearly that the numbers are copied from the papers. \n\n[1] ShapleyIQ: Influence Quantification by Shapley Values for Performance Debugging of Microservices.

When the prior knowledge is not sufficient, the discovery of causal graph is lack of validation, and the resulting RCA becomes wield. \n- My suggestion is that, based on the SCM model, designing some statistics from the data rather the first-discover-then-identify approach, as the latter paradigm is somehow incremental and risky.\n\n2. **Main Concern 2**: As this paper is not the first work to introduce multi-modal information into RCA, I think that this paper should focus on building theoretical understanding on why and how multi-modal information will be beneficial towards RCA.
