    "title": "Exponential Topology-enabled Scalable Communication in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), well-designed communication protocols can effectively facilitate consensus among agents, thereby enhancing task performance. Moreover, in large-scale multi-agent systems commonly found in real-world applications, effective communication plays an even more critical role due to the escalated challenge of partial observability compared to smaller-scale setups. In this work, we endeavor to develop a scalable communication protocol for MARL. Unlike previous methods that focus on selecting optimal pairwise communication links\u2014a task that becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents grows\u2014we adopt a global perspective on communication topology design. Specifically, we propose to utilize the exponential topology to enable rapid information dissemination among agents by leveraging its small-diameter and small-size properties. This approach leads to a scalable communication protocol, named ExpoComm. To fully unlock the potential of exponential graphs as communication topologies, we employ memory-based message processors and auxiliary tasks to ground messages, ensuring that they reflect global information and benefit decision-making. Extensive experiments on large-scale cooperative benchmarks, including MAgent and Infrastructure Management Planning, demonstrate the superior performance and robust zero-shot transferability of ExpoComm compared to existing communication strategies.",

Exponential graphs offer a small-diameter structure enabling ExpoComm to have rapid and cost-effective communication across agents. The method overcomes the need to finding task specific pairwise communication. The authors utilize a memory based message network for processing messages over time and to allow agents to accumulate and utilize past information. In addition, auxiliary tasks are used to align messages with global information, either through direct access to the global state (when available) or through contrastive learning techniques. The method is evaluated on MAgent gridworld benchmarks and compared with baselines having varying communication protocols.  The one-peer verison of the exponential graph performed the best despite only requiring a linear scaling communication cost."

It would probably be best to add a formalized definition, as communication overhead has very field-specific connotations beyond computer science. While addressed by the authors in the introduction, it is possible to reduce communication overhead by only communicating with a subset of peers. If ExpoComm does produce lower communication overhead, I think this paper could be strengthened significantly by adding additional metrics where the number of messages (or unique messages) ExpoComm has sent is directly compared against another method that only communicates with a subset of agents (eg DGN). From my understanding, Table 1 lacks these comparisons now. If ExpoComm does not result in lower numbers of messages passed between agents against comparable baselines (eg. MAGIC, DGN), then I would recommend clarifying the wording throughout the paper, to be in line with your definition of communication overhead."

Do you have theories about why this is? \n\n- Did you experiment with more K values beyond log2N and 1? If so, what did you observe and why did you believe these two values in the paper would be representative examples?\n\n- Does communication overhead in this paper refer to number of messages passed? Can you provide a definition in-text? Are there additional communciation savings that can be achieved by your method beyond its exponential graph structure?
