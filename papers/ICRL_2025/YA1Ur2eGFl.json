    "title": "Live2Diff: Live Stream Translation via Uni-directional Attention in Video Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and *previous* tokens.\nHowever, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing.\nState-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage\n*bi*-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the *surrounding* (i.e. including *future*) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos.\nTo address this problem, we present **Live2Diff**, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation.\nCompared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames.\nAdditionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a *kv-cache* mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.",

                "value": "**Limited Analysis of Dynamic Scenes**\n\n- The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of videos containing rapid motion or frequent scene changes. The authors are recommended adding comparative experiments between the warmup approach and simple unidirectional attention for several scenarios: videos with fast camera movements, videos with quick scene transitions, and action sequences with rapid object motion. In addition, I'm concerned if the warmup window might become useless or perform worse than simple unidirectional attention when the content is no longer relevant to the first few frames.\n\n**Depth Predictor Integration & Evaluation**\n\n- The current depth Mean Square Error (MSE) metric creates an unfair comparison between methods. To address this limitation, I suggest adding structural similarity metrics between frames that are independent of depth, such as SSIM and LPIPS. Furthermore, evaluations should be conducted both with and without depth conditioning to ensure a more equitable comparison.\n\n**Visual Quality Issues**\n- Several visual artifacts are noticeable in the results presented in the supplementary material. I suggest including detailed analyses of these failure cases to better understand the method's limitations and potential areas for improvement."

In specific, the uni-directional attention is conditioned on a sliding window of a few preceding frames, and the warmup contains attention from a small number of frames at the beginning of the video. To achieve real-time inference, Live2Diff uses three techniques: First, it replaces vanilla diffusion models with LCM-LoRA to reduce the number of denoising steps. Second, it uses a KV-cache during the implementation to avoid redundant computation. Third, it designs a pipelined denoising approach to accelerate model inference. In the experiments, the author(s) compare Live2Diff with three video translation methods, including StreamDiffusion, Rerender, and FreeNoise, and demonstrate that Live2Diff achieves higher CLIP scores and lower warp error while requiring lower latency."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.\tI have some doubts about the novelty in this paper. In specific, just like the authors mentioned, several works have adopted an autoregressive way for long video generation, e.g. ART-V, SEINE, Gen-L-Video, Reuse and Diffuse. The idea of incorporating a small number of frames in the beginning is also not new [1]. The author(s) claim their major contributions of proposing uni-directional attention with warmup. However, it seems naive to me that the author(s) simply replace bidirectional attentions with uni-directional attentions because of the problem setting, where the target frame shall not have seen the later frames and can only use the information from preceding frames. Regarding warmup, it can be seen in Table 2 that warmup does not provide significant improvements. (Row A, B, and C have similar values.) Instead, the improvement comes from using additional depth priors instead of model architecture. \n2.\tThe selected baselines are somehow outdated. Similar work, such as StreamV2V (Open source, Arxiv, May 2024), that also targets real-time streaming video should be included for comparison. State-of-the-art video translation methods, like CoDeF and FlowVid, which may have better temporal consistency, editing performance, but lower throughput, should also be compared. In specific, StreamV2V lies in exactly the same scope as the paper, and they compare with both CoDeF and FlowVid, both of which outperform the selected baselines, i.e. Rerender and FreeNoise, with much better temporal consistency.\n3.\tThe literature review is not complete enough. There are several missing methods for video processing. To my best knowledge, existing methods can mainly be classified into four categories: propagation-based, representation-based, canonical-based, and attention-based. These methods use different strategies to improve temporal consistency, like propagation across frames [2,3], video deformation [4,5], transferring video to canonical space [6,7], or using attention mechanisms. It is acceptable that the paper only focuses on attention-based methods, which is much closer to the scope, but there are still many missing approaches that use diffusion models for video generation/editing. Some of them are zero-shot methods that do not require model training, e.g. Controlvideo, Tokenflow, Control-A-Video,  VideoControlnet, Text2video-zero. Some of them further enhance temporal consistency with cross-attention, e.g. Tune-A-Video, Text2Video-Zero, FateZero, Vid2Vid-Zero. Some works propose training for video editing, e.g. Imagen Video, Make-A-Video. In short, I suggest the author(s) provide more comprehensive literature review in Section 2.\n4.\tThe temporal consistency is bad in some examples demonstrated. (Comparison 1, 2, 3, 6) To my knowledge, this is because the backgrounds in these examples contain more 'high-frequency' details. In other words, they are more complicated, compared to other 'dancing human' videos in indoor scenes with simple background. Since the paper has incorporated the depth priors, is it possible to first differentiate the static (background) and dynamic objects (human subjects, for example) in the video, and then do a simple masking techniques to avoid temporal inconsistency in the static background?\n\n\n[1] W Harvey et al., Flexible Diffusion Modeling of Long Videos, NeurIPS 2022.\n\n[2] O Jamri\u0161ka, Stylizing video by example.

Since the baselines may not have depth priors, I am curious about the qualitative comparison between baselines, uni-directional attention with warmup, and uni-directional attention with warmup and depth.\n2.\tCould you provide the video results of Figure 3? It seems that the full model with Figure 3(f), i.e. full model with depth, has worse temporal consistency than Figure 3(e), i.e. full model without depth, specifically at the regions of human clothes and face. I expect serious jittering artifacts in Figure 3(f).\n3.\tCould you provide the comparison with more baselines, especially StreamV2V?\n4.\tIt seems to me that all the generated results are very similar to the input videos, and the prompt must align with the input videos. Is it possible for Live2Diff to do other editing tasks besides style transfer, for example, changing the color of human clothes?\n5. See weakness."
