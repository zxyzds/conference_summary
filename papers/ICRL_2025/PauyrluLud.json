    "title": "Supervised Band Selection with a Concrete Layer for Hyperspectral Imagery in Remote Sensing and Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imagery captures rich spectral information, which is valuable for a wide range of applications but poses challenges due to high data dimensionality. Current band selection methods are often computationally intensive, non-embedded, or lack adaptability for specific tasks. We address this gap by introducing a novel plug-and-play embedded method for supervised band selection in hyperspectral imagery, utilizing a concrete selector layer based on the Gumbel-Softmax re-parameterization trick. Our approach allows for dynamic and task-specific selection of optimal bands, eliminating the need for pre-processing and enabling seamless integration with downstream models. We evaluated the method on four hyperspectral datasets, covering three remote sensing benchmarks and an autonomous driving task, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods. This is the first work to perform comprehensive band-selection research on an autonomous driving dataset of this type, and the first to employ a concrete layer for supervised band selection. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach for real-time hyperspectral analysis in applications such as autonomous driving and environmental monitoring, laying the groundwork for further exploration of efficient, domain-specific band selection.",

There is a significant overlap between the content of Section 3 \"Methods\" in this paper and EHBS [1], including the task setup section. It is recommended that the authors write based on their own research rather than directly copying existing work.\n3. Compared to EHBS [1], the primary contribution of this paper is the application of the Gumbel-Softmax [2] reparameterization technique for band selection, which focuses on application rather than theoretical and technical innovation.\n4. The paper mentions that the experiments required extensive hyperparameter tuning, and different tasks needed distinct configurations, indicating a lack of robustness and generalization ability of the method. Current deep learning models do not heavily rely on band selection when learning downstream tasks, and the high cost of hyperparameter tuning raises concerns about the practicality of the method.\n5. The authors should supplement experimental results from other models on downstream tasks, including traditional algorithms and deep learning models (based on CNN and Transformer architectures), to demonstrate the applicability of the method.\n6. The authors should add comparisons with newer band selection algorithms from the past two years, such as MOCS-BS [3] and IROA-BS [4].\n7. Given that the method introduces additional parameters, it is suggested to supplement the experimental results regarding the number of parameters, training time, GFLOPs, etc.\nReferences:\n[1] Zimmer Y, Glickman O.

                "value": "- There are few details about the proposed method. It is difficult for readers to understand the specific processes and details of the algorithm, considerably weakening the contribution of this work. \n\n- The paper highlights the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for each dataset and task, including parameters such as the temperature and noise factors (see Section 4.5). For instance, the optimal temperature value \u03c4 is selected from a range of [0, 10], with different optimal settings for remote sensing (\u03c4=1.5) and autonomous driving (\u03c4=8.5) datasets. This intensive tuning process is time-consuming and limits the model\u2019s scalability, making it less practical for new tasks without considerable retuning.\n\n- In Section 4.5, the authors report that the Gumbel-Softmax concrete layer often selects duplicate bands when randomly initialized, resulting in reduced diversity among selected bands (Figure 6a). To mitigate this, the authors introduced a custom initialization method that segments the spectrum and assigns different bands to each selector, avoiding duplication (Figure 6b). However, this approach complicates the implementation and may not be easily replicable in other scenarios, particularly if the spectral characteristics differ.\n\n- The model shows substantial variability in performance across tasks, as discussed in Section 6, indicating that task-specific tuning is necessary. For example, remote sensing tasks use a 3D CNN architecture, while the autonomous driving task relies on a UNet-based framework. This dependence on different architectures reduces the model\u2019s transferability to other applications, particularly in cases where the band selection task or network structure differs significantly.\n\n- As described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the model\u2019s evaluation heavily relies on 3D CNN and UNet architectures for the remote sensing and autonomous driving tasks, respectively. While effective for segmentation, this approach may not generalize well to other network structures or machine learning tasks, such as classification, thus limiting the method\u2019s adaptability for broader applications.\n\n- Although the model has been shown to be suitable for real-time applications, the paper does not include practical deployment scenarios, such as on-site or on-device evaluations. This omission leaves open questions about the practical feasibility and performance of the method outside of controlled experimental settings, which would be important for validating its usability in applications such as autonomous driving or environmental monitoring."

Specifically, how were final values for parameters chosen, and to what extent did these settings impact generalizability across tasks? According to the write up, it seems that the selection of parameters depends entirely on manual tuning, and the inability to achieve an adaptive approach will greatly reduce the universality of the algorithm.\n- Could you pls elaborate on how frequently duplicate band selection occurred during standard initialization? Additionally, would the proposed spectrum-segmentation initialization method generalize well to datasets with significantly different spectral distributions?\n- Given the reliance on 3D CNN and UNet architectures, have you considered using other networks that are more efficient and with greater adaptability?\n- Could you pls provide more details on how the selected bands impacted downstream performance, particularly in cases where fewer bands were chosen? Are there any specific spectral regions that consistently contribute to better model performance across datasets?\n- Have you conducted any tests and evaluations in practical scenarios to verify the robustness of the algorithm in real-world situations, such as real-time processing under limited computational resources or low-power environments?"

Further discussion on why this choice is optimal, given HSI\u2019s specific demands, would strengthen the theoretical basis.\n\n2. **Over-Reliance on Baseline Comparisons Without Detailed Analysis**: While the authors compare their method against nine baselines, there is limited exploration of why their method outperforms others beyond reporting metrics. For example, analyzing why the Gumbel-Softmax layer improves performance in some datasets but not in others could provide a clearer understanding of the approach\u2019s strengths and limitations.\n\n3. **Inadequate Explanation of Initialization Techniques**: The paper introduces an initialization scheme that reportedly prevents duplicate band selection. However, the description lacks depth, particularly regarding its comparative advantage over other initialization techniques. Furthermore, more quantitative results could better substantiate the claim that this initialization scheme improves performance.\n\n4. **Limited Insight into Computational Efficiency**: Although embedded methods are generally more efficient, the authors do not provide detailed computational or runtime analyses to substantiate efficiency claims. Reporting metrics such as training time, memory usage, or computational complexity relative to baseline methods would be valuable, especially for real-time applications like autonomous driving.\n\n5. **Insufficient Discussion on Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The method reportedly requires extensive hyperparameter tuning, which raises concerns about its practical utility. Despite noting the sensitivity, the authors do not provide a systematic study of how specific hyperparameters (e.g., temperature \\(\\tau\\) in Gumbel-Softmax) affect performance across datasets, leaving questions about the method\u2019s robustness.\n\n6. **Generalization Limitations**: The paper acknowledges that different tasks require different hyperparameter configurations but fails to address this as a limitation. Without a standardized approach or guidelines for parameter selection, the applicability across tasks and scalability of this method remains unclear.\n\n7. **Ambiguity in Experimental Settings**: Although the datasets are well described, the details on experimental protocols are sparse. For example, it is unclear if the training-validation splits were consistent across all experiments, which could affect reproducibility and comparability of results."
