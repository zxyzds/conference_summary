    "title": "Flow matching achieves almost minimax optimal convergence",
    "abstract": "Flow matching (FM) has gained significant attention as a simulation-free generative model. Unlike diffusion models, which are based on stochastic differential equations, FM employs a simpler approach by solving an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition from a normal distribution, thus streamlining the sample generation process. This paper discusses the convergence properties of FM in terms of the $p$-Wasserstein distance, a measure of distributional discrepancy. We establish that FM can achieve an almost minimax optimal convergence rate for $1 \\leq p \\leq 2$, presenting the first theoretical evidence that FM can reach convergence rates comparable to those of diffusion models. Our analysis extends existing frameworks by examining a broader class of mean and variance functions for the vector fields and identifies specific conditions necessary to attain these optimal rates.",

                "value": "The paper provides estimates for the 2-Wasserstein distance for the sample-based distribution obtained in the Flow-Matching framework relative to the exact distribution. These estimates depend on the number of samples used in training, the smoothness of the true distribution as an element of the Besov space, the asymptote of the growth of the conditional map at the initial time instant.\nThe paper considers the early stopping mode of the ODE, when the solution stops at time $T_0<1$, and the estimates of $T_0$ are also given."

In particular, using Besov space for target density, B-splines for its approximation, etc. Many estimates are based on thouse from [1], see, for example, Appendix A.4--A.5 of the presented paper, where the citation on [1] are explicit. In paper [1] diffusion models are considered, but as shown in paper [2], Flow Matching approach includes, under certain conditions, Diffusion models approach. Thus, generalization or obtaining similar results for Flow Matching is rather straightforward. Namely, in essence, the difference is to use Alekseev-Gr\u00f6bner Theorem (Lemma 16 about error of a perturbed solution of ODE) instead of Girsanov\u2019s Theorem (Proposition D.1 of [1] for error of a perturbed solution of SDE).\nOne of the main differences is the presence in the estimates of the degree of growth of the parameter $\\sigma_t$ at 1, but the authors come to the well-known (empirical) conclusion that the optimal asymptotics is $\\sqrt t$. Does this provide the first theoretical justification for this empirically observed optimal scaling?  How can one intuitively realize that the degree of $\\sigma_t$ growth near the time point $t=1$ is important if the ODE solution is considered on the interval $[0, T_0]$, where $T_0<1$?\n\n\n[1] Kazusato Oko, Shunta Akiyama, and Taiji Suzuki.
