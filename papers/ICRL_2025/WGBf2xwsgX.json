    "title": "Alberta Wells Dataset: Pinpointing Oil and Gas Wells from Satellite Imagery",
    "abstract": "Millions of abandoned oil and gas wells are scattered across the world, leaching methane into the atmosphere and toxic compounds into the groundwater. Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale dataset for this problem, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended, and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts. We evaluate baseline algorithms for well detection and segmentation, showing the promise of computer vision approaches but also significant room for improvement.",

Using a 2-step clustering approach, the images were split into a training, validation, and test set. The authors report binary segmentation results for several deep learning models including convolutional neural networks and a vision transformer. Additionally, results from object detection models are reported as an alternative approach. Models achieve good performance on both tasks (IoU values > 0.6).\n\nThis dataset lists several contributions compared to existing datasets, including its large scale, the use of high-resolution Planet imagery, and the availability of well type (abandoned, suspended, and active) data. However, large scale mainly refers to data volume and not to geographic diversity. Furthermore, the paper does not demonstrate the usefulness of the well type data. These limitations reduce the contribution of the paper compared to existing datasets."

In comparison, an existing dataset (NEPU-OWOD V3) features sites across China and California, US. In general, I argue that adding more data for a specific region (although I also acknowledge that Alberta is a large region) is less important than including oil and gas wells from a diverse set of geographic locations to test the generalization ability of models. The importance of this (specifically the robustness of models to geographic distribution shifts) is also one of the key points in Rolf et al. (2024) which the paper cites.\n\n- Although the well type data is a key contribution of the paper, the authors did not include any experiments to demonstrate its usefulness. Furthermore, the dataset splitting does not seem to take well types into account. I suggest adding well type distributions across the sets to Figure 1.\n\n- The authors state that existing datasets predominantly contain active wells, which limits their applicability in the context of identifying abandoned or suspended wells (l86), while also admitting that the physical appearance of different well types is very similar (l133). The latter would mean that models trained on only active wells generalize to all well types, which contradicts the former. Please clarify this (ideally with experimental results).\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- I suggest adding a subfigure to Figure 3, showing the point density of the image locations.\n- There are also some typos and minor grammar mistakes (eg l46: \"onshore wells oil and gas wells\").\n- I also suggest labeling the spatial resolution of Planet data as \"high-resolution\" instead of \"medium-resolution\", a term that is usually reserved for imagery with spatial resolutions of > 10 m (e.g. Landsat).\n- The authors might also want to mention the SpaceNet 7 dataset which features Planet imagery and includes a study site with oil wells (L15-0434E-1218N_1736_3318_13), even though the dataset was developed for multi-temporal urban monitoring."

For example, line 431 states, \"For the binary segmentation task framing, we train both CNN-based and Transformer-based backbones, considering the prevalent imbalance in the image data due to the small size of wells.\" This description is somewhat vague. If it implies that the backbones were pre-trained, it should be clearly stated which datasets were used for this pre-training. In Section 4, BENCHMARK EXPERIMENTS, it might not be clear to the reader whether the experiments used only the RGB three channels or included the near-infrared to make four channels. Although Section 3 states that the dataset provides four channels, repeating this in the experimental setup could be beneficial.\n2.\tTables 4 and 5 display the benchmark performances of various classical semantic segmentation and object detection architectures on this dataset. While this work does not provide experiments with different model sizes (such as small, base, large versions), this might be sufficient for this dataset. However, including the parameter count and computational load of each benchmark model in the tables would add value to the discussion of segmentation and detection results.\n3.\tThe state-of-the-art backbone, ConvNeXt, was omitted in the experiments. Providing its performance in remote sensing image analysis would make the article's benchmark presentation more comprehensive.\n4.\tIn Figure 4, the satellite images reveal that wells may not always be perfectly circular, yet the semantic segmentation annotations are uniformly circular, and the object detection bounding boxes are uniformly square. This may not accurately reflect the real shape of wells, but the article lacks an explanation for this, except for a mention on line 335 about the \"teardrop shape typical for well sites.\" The accuracy of these annotations might be the primary limitation of this dataset.\n5.\tLine 336 states that wells \"typically range from 70 to 120 meters in diameter,\" indicating that wells in Alberta are relatively uniform in size. In contrast, other datasets, like the Well Pad Dataset, exhibit more significant size variations, which could impact the performance of few- or zero-shot transfer learning, as mentioned on line 503. Discussing regional differences in well characteristics could enhance this section."

If so, a detailed discussion in the text would be beneficial. \n2.\tLine 338 mentions that, although no relevant experiments were conducted, the data annotation also includes the status of wells (active, suspended, or abandoned). I am curious whether these different statuses manifest distinct characteristics in remote sensing images (e.g., in multispectral bands).
