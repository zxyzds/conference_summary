    "title": "FlightBench: Benchmarking Learning-based Methods for Ego-vision-based Quadrotors Navigation",
    "abstract": "Ego-vision-based navigation in cluttered environments is crucial for mobile systems, particularly agile quadrotors. While learning-based methods have shown promise recently, head-to-head comparisons with cutting-edge optimization-based approaches are scarce, leaving open the question of where and to what extent they truly excel. In this paper, we introduce FlightBench, the first comprehensive benchmark that implements various learning-based methods for ego-vision-based navigation and evaluates them against mainstream optimization-based baselines using a broad set of performance metrics. Additionally, we develop a suite of criteria to assess scenario difficulty and design test cases that span different levels of difficulty based on these criteria. Our results show that while learning-based methods excel in high-speed flight and faster inference, they struggle with challenging scenarios like sharp corners or view occlusion. Analytical experiments validate the correlation between our difficulty criteria and flight performance. We hope this benchmark and these criteria will drive future advancements in learning-based navigation for ego-vision quadrotors.

In particular, the paper first introduces the paucity of a 3d scene based benchmark to compare learning-based navigation methods against classical optimization methods. To do so, the paper has 3 main contributions:\n\n1. 8 new tasks categorized into 3 scenarios - forests, mazes and multi-waypoints scenarios with varying levels of difficulty, all of which are simulated with Gazebo, Flightmare and ROS.\n2. A total of 7 baseline methods categorized into ego-vision based (learning and optimization), and privileged methods.\n3. 3 new task difficulty metrics - traversability obstruction, view occlusion and angle over length; to quantify challenges faced during agile navigation.\n\nIn addition to comparing learning based methods vs optimization based methods, the paper aims to also analyze navigation performance across different difficulty settings, and the effect of system latency, and provides conclusions on flight quality, flight speed, compute cost, latency and the effectiveness of metrics."

The paper is generally well-written, and well motivates the need for a 3D scene based benchmark for ego-vision agile navigation, which is currently unaddressed by other benchmarks. \u2028\n2. The 3 proposed task-difficulty metrics, can comprehensively capture and quantify the challenge of a particular scene with obstacles. In addition, the proposed scenarios are diverse in terms of the task difficulty metrics and capture the different operating conditions often faced.\u2028\n3. A number of SOTA baselines have been used in the benchmark, covering both learning based, and optimization based methods, as well as methods that leverage additional environmental information. This helps the authors to analyze and remark on various factors in flight performance. Furthermore, the supplementary qualitatively discusses failure cases and their correlation with difficulty metrics."

Furthermore, the authors do not discuss and analyze the number of scenarios compared to previous baselines. It would be good to have this in the paper. The authors should also discuss the diversity of previous baselines in terms of their proposed task difficulty metrics.\u2028\n3. Gazebo and ROS-Noetic is used as the simulation platform, which often does not provide realistic scene quality, which could be important for ego-vision based learning. This is also visible through the lack of realistic scene quality. I am curious why the authors did not choose a newer platform like Isaac-Sim and ROS-2 given that they support the new de-facto standards?\n\nMinor comments: This paper seems to be more suitable for a robotics conference/venue than ICLR."

The proposed methodology brings together implementations of various traditional (optimisation-based) and learnable solutions from the literature, as well as oracle (environment-aware) baselines, and quantitatively compares them in 3 different environments with varying challenges. Several metrics capturing different aspects of navigation performance are employed (including success rate, speed, latency and other aspects such as energy and dynamic behavior, through proxies), along with a set of metrics to capture task difficulty based on the simulator environment. The manuscript concludes with several insights arising from this comparison, indicating areas for further improvement in the adopted baselines."

                "value": "- The majority of metrics and methods considered in the proposed baseline have been proposed above, or widely used in the community. This may limit the novelty of the proposed approach. However, in my opinion its contribution remains unaffected, as it still provides a comprehensive suite for uniformly evaluating different navigation approaches. \n- The proposed benchmark remains rather targeted on static environments and sensing modalities. Driven by the easy extendibility of the proposed framework due to the use of simulated environments, incorporating more sensory cues (e.g. LiDAR, depth, IMU, event camera etc) and more scenarios (e.g. navigation in dynamic environments, drone racing etc) will create a more robust arena and further facilitate the attempt of this work towards standardization in the experiments of the field. \n- Relying solely on simulated data, several important aspects of the navigation performance of different methods cannot be accurate evaluated. These include (most crucially) robustness to noisy input data, or lack of scale of training data for deployment in real-world scenarios. At least emulating such cases in the simulated setting will make the obtained results for the proposed benchmark more convincing and representative. \n\n\nMinor comments:\n- Can you define the bounds, or provide qualitative example-score pairs, for the task difficulty metrics defined in Section 3.1 to make the interpretation of Table 2 more intuitive?\n- Although the proposed benchmark is more comprehensive, related work could benefit from a broader discussion of other real-world UAV, that can also act as benchmarks for more specific tasks such as ego-motion estimation or drone racing. e.g. :\n\nDelmerico, J., Cieslewski, T., Rebecq, H., Faessler, M. and Scaramuzza, D., 2019, May.
