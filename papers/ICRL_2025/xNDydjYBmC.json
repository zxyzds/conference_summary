    "title": "Enhancing PPB Affinity Prediction through Data Integration and Feature Alignment: Approaching Structural Model Performance with Sequences",
    "abstract": "One key step of protein drug development is the screening of protein-protein binding (PPB) affinity. The current mainstream screening method of PPB affinity is laboratory experiments, which are costly and time-consuming, making it difficult to quickly perform high-throughput screening. Various deep learning methods have been proposed to predict PPB affinity, but they are often limited by the availability of high-quality data and the compatibility of the algorithms with that data. In this work, we developed two AI models, PPBind-3D and PPBind-1D, to predict PPB affinity. PPBind-3D leverages structural information near the protein-protein binding interface to make its predictions. By employing monotonic neural network constrained multi-task learning, we effectively utilized heterogeneous affinity data from diverse wet lab experiments to expand the development dataset to over 23,000 samples, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, PPBind-1D was developed using sequence data to address the lack of structural data in practical applications. During the training of PPBind-1D, we aligned it with PPBind-3D by incorporating an additional 42,108 no-affinity-label samples through an alignment approach. Finally, we demonstrated three application cases of our AI models in the virtual screening of protein drugs, illustrating that our models can significantly facilitate high-throughput screening.",

For readers unfamiliar with the subject, the abbreviation \"PPB\" may be confusing; using it in an already lengthy title is somewhat counterintuitive.

As the authors mentioned in Section 3, the lack of strict data splitting is problematic for validating models. Why do the authors use models trained on randomly split data in Section 5.2? How can model performance be validated when the data splitting process is not strict? Will there be a significant drop in model performance in the virtual screening scenario introduced in Section 5.2 when using strictly split datasets?\n4.
