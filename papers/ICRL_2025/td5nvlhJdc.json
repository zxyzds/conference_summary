    "title": "IDEA: Enhancing the Rule Learning Ability of Large Language Model Agent through Induction, Deduction, and Abduction",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have been thoroughly evaluated for deductive and inductive reasoning, their proficiency in abductive reasoning and holistic rule learning in interactive environments remains less explored. We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses using patterns identified from new observations through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, within this framework, our comparison with 50 human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors. LLM agents tend to generate plausible initial hypotheses but struggle to refine them through interaction. Conversely, humans, despite sometimes overlooking initial details, excel at incorporating feedback and continuously improving their hypotheses. We believe our benchmark, RULEARN, will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and that the IDEA framework will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data upon acceptance of the paper.",

                "value": "This works proposes RULEARN, a benchmark consists of interactive puzzles that are designed to assess the rulelearning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. It also proposes IDEA, an agent that dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. It has the following three steps: (1) generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, (2) devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, (3) refines previous hypotheses using patterns identified from new observations through induction. With the novel testbed and the rule-learning framework, this paper also compares LLM agent rule-learning abilities with that of humans. Such study shows several interesting insights: (1) LLM agents continue to struggle with efficiently exploring unfamiliar environments. (2) LLMs fall short in deducting valid plans to verify current hypotheses\nand guide future exploration. (3) LLMs fall short to correct previous hypotheses when they contradict new observations and are less capable of refining a hypothesis to make it more robust."

The proposed IDEA agent needs prompt tuning for each specific problem, which limits its generalizability.

Instead, the agent is simply solving an easier task with additional information about the rule. Therefore, this might not serve as a fair or useful upper bound, as the task is actually different. Based on L311-312, \u201cEven if the agent could successfully learn the correct rule, applying the learned rule to solve the puzzle is non-trivial,\u201d I assume the authors meant that the \u201cmeta-rule\u201d is provided, but the agent still needs to determine the exact instantiation. I think this should be clarified further to avoid confusion.\n- It would be interesting if the authors could include a breakdown of performance based on puzzle difficulty for different models. Difficulty could be measured using the statistics defined in Appendix A2, e.g., for the Function Operator, it could be the number of functions, etc. This could help readers understand how the performance of different models changes when varying difficulty levels.\n- There are many studies evaluating LMs\u2019 performance on text-based games, e.g. [1] and many follow-up works. In most of these settings, the LM agent needs to determine the goal and solve the game. What\u2019s the difference between this paper and that line of work? Is the key difference that the rule is more fine-grained, or that the IDEA agent is explicitly evaluated on induction, abduction, and deduction? It would be beneficial if the authors could further discuss and clarify this.\n\n[1] Marc-Alexandre C\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00c1kos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, Xingdi Yuan, Ben Kybartas, Tavian Barnes, Emery Fine, James Moore, Ruo Yu Tao, Matthew Hausknecht, Layla El Asri, Mahmoud Adada, Wendy Tay, Adam Trischler.
