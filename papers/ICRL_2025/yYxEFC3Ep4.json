    "title": "Where Do Images Come From? Analyzing Captions to Geographically Profile Datasets",
    "abstract": "Building on studies documenting gender and racial biases in vision-language models, recent works show that such models often fail to generate geographically-representative images that accurately reflect different regions around the world. A common concern is that the data used to train these models is not representative, prompting the question: *which parts of the world do these training examples come from?* To answer this question, we develop a system, *GeoProfiler*, which geographically profiles multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries. Using location information from captions, GeoProfiler maps examples to countries with a high precision ($0.86$). We then apply *GeoProfiler* to geographically profile the English captions of the LAION dataset for $10$ common entities (e.g., house, flag, etc.). We observe the geographical distribution of $8$ entities to obey the power law distribution. The United States, the United Kingdom, and India are most represented, appearing in 53.7% of samples. Problematically, African and South American countries are severely under-represented with only 2.0 % and 4.3 % of images respectively. We also observe a high correlation between a country's GDP and frequency ($\\rho=0.79$). Lastly, we analyze the diversity of images from individual countries, and find that more images does not imply higher diversity.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a system called \"GeoProfiler,\" which maps image-caption pairs in vision-language datasets to corresponding countries. Specifically, the study analyzes the geographical distribution of 10 entities using the LAION2B-en dataset, which contains images with English captions. The results show that 46.1% of all captions are underspecified, and the geographical distribution of eight entities follows a power law distribution. Additionally, it was found that countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and India are frequently represented, while countries in South America, Africa, and Oceania are underrepresented. Furthermore, an investigation into the country-wise diversity of images for each entity revealed that frequency does not correlate with diversity."

                "value": "The paper addresses the issue of geographical biases in vision-language models (VLMs) by investigating the geographical origins of images used in training these models. The authors introduce GeoProfiler, a system designed to map image-caption pairs in multimodal datasets to their corresponding countries based on location information extracted from captions. GeoProfiler employs a large language model (Mixtral-8x7B Instruct) to accurately infer countries from captions, achieving a high precision of 0.86 and recall of 0.82.\nThe authors apply GeoProfiler to the LAION2B-en dataset, a large-scale dataset with English captions. They focus on 10 globally relevant entities (e.g., house, flag, car) to analyze the geographical distribution of the data. The key findings echo previous works in this area and include:\n- The geographical distribution of images is highly skewed, following a power law distribution in 8/10 entities. The United States, the United Kingdom, and India are the most represented countries, accounting for 53.7% of the samples. \n- African and South American countries are significantly underrepresented, constituting only 2.0% and 4.3% of the images, respectively\n- There is a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.79) between a country's GDP and its frequency in the dataset, indicating that wealthier countries are more represented.\n- An analysis of the diversity of images from individual countries reveals that a higher number of images does not necessarily imply greater diversity.\n- A 46.1% of captions lack geographical information.\n\nThe paper highlights the limitations of current methods in determining image sources and emphasizes the importance of creating geographically representative datasets. GeoProfiler is a tool aimed to help data curators and practitioners measure and improve the geographical diversity of datasets."

                "value": "- The research is methodologically sound and exhibits a good level of rigor. The authors systematically develop GeoProfiler, starting with an analysis of simple baselines like string-matching and Named Entity Recognition (NER), and demonstrating their limitations in this context. By employing the Mixtral-8x7B Instruct model, they achieve a high precision of 0.86 in mapping captions to countries. The application of GeoProfiler to the LAION2B-en dataset is thorough, involving the analysis of 1 million image-caption pairs for each of the 10 selected entities. The statistical analyses, including the correlation with GDP (rho = 0.79) and the power law distribution fitting lead to some insightful findings. The appendix provides extensive methodological details, particularly about the entity-presence filtering process, the creation of the annotation dataset, and the inter-annotator agreements (Appendix A.3).\n- The paper is well-written and clearly structured. Each component of GeoProfiler is explained in detail, and the methodology is presented in detail, facilitating reproducibility. The use of figures and tables, such as the world maps showing the distribution of countries for specific entities and the correlation graphs with GDP, illustrate the key points. Additionally, the authors provide qualitative examples and comprehensive appendices that enhance the reader's understanding of their approach and findings.\n- This work holds significance in the domains of AI bias, data ethics, and responsible AI development. By studying and quantifying the geographical biases present in large-scale datasets like LAION2B-en, the paper provides insights into how such biases can propagate into VLMs and affect their deployment globally. The strong correlation between country representation and GDP indicates socio-economic disparities reflected in AI training data. These findings emphasize the need for more geographically diverse datasets to ensure that AI models are representative of different regions around the world. GeoProfiler could potentially serve as a practical tool for data curators, practitioners, and auditors in their efforts to assess and improve geographical diversity in datasets."

                "value": "- Unfortunately, the authors seem to disregard a large body of pre-LLM work on geotagging multimodal data [1,2,3,4]. Their baseline approaches are quite simplistic (even though generally quite effective), while there are numerous text-based approaches that perform very accurately even at the level of city prediction. As a result, I have strong doubts on the accuracy and efficiency of GeoProfiler compared to pre-LLM state-of-the-art methods [2, 4].\n\n- While the authors have tried to extend their analysis to multilingual captions, the evaluation remains preliminary. The challenges faced suggest that the method may not generalize well to all languages.\n\n- The authors limit their analyses to only 10 entities, which might itself constitute yet another source of bias. It would be interesting to include at least one entity containing humans, which might also offer fruitful ground for more in-depth analysis of representation bias.\n\n- The authors have made some efforts to include and analyze data from underrepresented regions, however, details about these regions remain limited.\n\n- The authors do not delve deeper into socio-economic factors beyond the correlation with GDP.\n\n- No consideration is made of when the images were created/uploaded. The temporal aspect in the analysis could offer additional insights.\n\n[1] Middleton, et al. (2018). Location extraction from social media: Geoparsing, location disambiguation, and geotagging.
