    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the *geometric invariance hypothesis (GIH)*, which argues that when training a neural network, the input-space curvature remains invariant under transformation in certain directions determined by its architecture. Starting with a simple non-linear binary classification problem residing on a hyperplane in a high dimensional space, we observe that while an MLP can solve this problem regardless of the orientation of the hyperplane, this is not the case for a ResNet. Motivated by this example, we define two maps that provide a compact *architecture-dependent* summary of the input-space geometry of a neural network and its evolution during training, which we dub the average geometry and average geometry evolution, respectively. By investigating these two maps through theoretical and empirical means, we show that GIH is caused by the average geometry evolution being close to the projection of data covariance onto average geometry, resulting in an invariance property when the average geometry is low-rank. Finally, we present extensive experimental results to observe the consequences of GIH and how it relates to generalization in neural networks.",

The introduction of the Geometric Invariance Hypothesis appears novel and extends findings of Neural Anisotropy Directions (Ortiz-Jimenez et al., 2021) to non-linear decision boundaries. This hypothesis has the potential to provide insights into the relationship between neural network architecture and the structure of data, contributing to our understanding of inductive biases in deep learning.\n\n2. The experiments and the theoretical analysis are generally fair, although several imprecisions are present, and some clarifications are needed (see detailed points below).\n\n3. The theoretical findings are tested using real networks (e.g., ResNets, ViTs) and datasets (CIFAR). These experiments appear to align with and support the GIH. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the considered settings are highly overparameterized and relatively simple, which raises concerns regarding the broader validity and general significance of the results (see detailed points below)."

                "value": "The paper is quite dense. There are multiple points of confusion and imprecisions affecting both clarity and soundness. Specifically:\n\n4. The introduction and main text lack a comprehensive overview of the field and references to related work. Only a few broad papers are cited, despite the extended page limit of this year's edition. I strongly encourage the authors to move much of the discussion from Appendix A.1 into the main text to better place the work in context. In particular, NADs introduced in Ortiz-Jimenez et al. (2021) should be explicitly discussed in the main text, given how strongly related they are to this work.\n\n5. Lines L058+ seem to confuse expressivity with generalization, i.e., approximation vs. statistical properties. The fact that an MLP is universal (as some deep and wide CNNs are) does not imply that it can generalize effectively. \n\n6. Assuming i.i.d. parameters is not enough to conclude that $G_F \\propto I$. A Gaussian distribution with a non-zero mean is a counterexample.\n\n7. The claim that MLPs have a lack of inductive bias (L210, L224, L249) is wrong. Even in the NTK regime, MLPs display a strong spectral bias for low modes. It may be more accurate to state that MLPs at initialization have no preferred directions in the input space, i.e., they have an isotropic prior in the input space.\n\n8. Multiple terms are left undefined or used imprecisely: e.g., \u201cSSE loss\u201d and $y_{\\mu}$. Some phrases are vague: What is the \u201cinput-space curvature\u201d, and how can it depend on the training process (L011)? What is the \u201cinput geometry\u201d of a neural network (L076, L521)? What does it mean for a dimension to be noise (L053)? What are \u201call the possible values of $\\theta$\u201d ( L145)? How are they distributed? Given that you consider gradient-flow in your analysis, how do you define the \u201cfirst step\u201d in L286?"

From Figure 1, it seems that simple (and standard) early stopping would solve the generalization gap problem and actually result in a lower test loss for dataset $D_B$ compared to dataset $D_A$. Can you comment on this? How general is this observation? \n\n10. What\u2019s the underlying distribution over which you are taking the expectation at L227? It should be made explicit.\n\n11. When you write \u201cmomentums\u201d (L244, L246) do you mean \u201cmoments\u201d instead?\n\n12. Is the fact that $\\Delta_F$ becomes label-independent purely due to the fact that you assume $\\mathbb{E}_\\theta [\\theta]=0$ at initialization?\n\n13. Could the phenomena observed in the paper, particularly when testing conjecture 2 about the GIH, be due to the fact that networks in all experiments are strongly overparameterized (even with CIFAR, the paper considers only a small fraction of the full dataset) and training in the \u201clazy\u201d or NTK regime where weights stay close to their initial values? Did the authors measure the weight evolution throughout training? Would you expect the same results when training with more data, e.g., the full CIFAR10 dataset, and/or with tasks requiring learning latent features of the data that might be less dependent on the exact geometry and statistics in input space, e.g., more complex image datasets such as ImageNet?\n\n14. Could the authors comment on Conjecture 2 in the case of linear regression? Intuitively, it seems it should hold in that simpler setting.\n\n15. What is the motivation behind adding label noise (L406)? Would the same results or trends be observed in its absence?"

This resulted in finding the special cases where the invariance occurs, and they link this to the generalization ability of the model and where it collapses to reliance on noise and memory."

The authors begin by examining a non-linear binary classification problem situated on a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space. They observe that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can solve this problem regardless of the hyperplane\u2019s orientation, whereas a residual network (ResNet) cannot. Motivated by this finding, they define two architecture-dependent maps: the average geometry, which provides a compact summary of the network\u2019s input-space geometry, and the average geometry evolution, which describes how this geometry changes during training. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigations, the paper demonstrates that GIH arises because the average geometry evolution closely approximates the projection of the data covariance onto the average geometry. This results in an invariance property, especially when the average geometry is low-rank. Finally, the authors present extensive experimental results to explore the consequences of GIH and its relationship to generalization in neural networks."
