    "title": "TTVD: Towards a Geometric Framework for Test-Time Adaptation Based on Voronoi Diagram",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models often struggle with generalization when deploying on real-world data, due to the common distributional shift to the training data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) is an emerging scheme used at inference time to address this issue. In TTA, models are adapted online at the same time when making predictions to test data. Neighbor-based approaches have gained attention recently, where prototype embeddings provide location information to alleviate the feature shift between training and testing data. However, due to their inherit limitation of simplicity, they often struggle to learn useful patterns and encounter performance degradation. To confront this challenge, we study the TTA problem from a geometric point of view. We first reveal that the underlying structure of neighbor-based methods aligns with the Voronoi Diagram, a classical computational geometry model for space partitioning. Building on this observation, we propose the Test-Time adjustment by Voronoi Diagram guidance (TTVD), a novel framework that leverages the benefits of this geometric property. Specifically, we explore two key structures: 1) Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD): This integrates the joint contribution of self-supervision and entropy-based methods to provide richer information. 2) Power Diagram (PD): A generalized version of the Voronoi Diagram that refines partitions by assigning weights to each Voronoi cell. Our experiments under rigid, peer-reviewed settings on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R shows that TTVD achieves remarkable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experimental results also explore the effects of batch size and class imbalance, which are two scenarios commonly encountered in real-world applications. These analyses further validate the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method using Voronoi Diagrams, termed TTVD. The manuscript highlights the integration of cluster-induced Voronoi Diagrams with Power Diagrams, marking their inaugural application in the TTA domain. This combination aims to ensure both flexibility and robustness within the method. Based on the experiments presented, TTVD demonstrates a clear reduction in errors, which is commendable. The writing is clear, the methodology sound, and the experimental outcomes show significant improvement. However, the manuscript does raise concerns about its level of innovation, primarily since it builds upon pre-existing methodologies without introducing novel concepts."

The main innovation of TTVD appears to be the combination of existing methods (Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram and Power Diagram), which might not sufficiently fulfill the criteria for substantial novelty.\n2. The manuscript lacks a comprehensive discussion and validation of parameter settings, such as \\gamma, \\eps, and \\tau, which are crucial for the reproducibility and understanding of the research.\n3. The comparative analysis primarily focuses on methods proposed up to and including 2023. Given the rapid advancements in the field, incorporating more recent methodologies (from 2024) could provide a more current understanding of TTVD's positioning."

                "value": "1. The parameter gamma seems to be a critical aspect of TTVD; however, its determination and impact on algorithm performance are not thoroughly discussed in the manuscript. Could you provide a detailed explanation on how gamma values are selected and their influence on the method's efficacy?\n2. Regarding the introduction of parameter eps in equation (3) to avoid the log0 issue, the justification seems unclear. The rationale that including eps prevents log0 errors in equation (3) is not compelling, as the log0 problem might not arise even without eps. Could you elaborate on the necessity of eps in this context?\n3. The manuscript assumes the Voronoi sites are pre-determined without detailing the process of converting Xtest into Voronoi sites. For clarity and completeness, please provide a comprehensive description of how Xtest data are transformed into Voronoi sites."

According to the TENT framework, TTA excludes access to source data, while TTT can include self-supervised losses on source data. TTVD\u2019s reliance on pre-computed Voronoi sites calculated during pre-training suggests it should be categorized as TTT rather than TTA. This distinction impacts baseline comparisons, as the current baselines primarily include TTA methods, potentially leading to an unfair performance comparison.\n- The paper claims that TTVD extends VD from a point-to-point structure to a cluster-to-point influence mechanism, but it\u2019s unclear why distances in standard VD (calculated by $\\mu_k$) would not already reflect cluster-to-point relationships. A clearer explanation of this transition\u2019s significance would be beneficial.\n- The method lacks details on integrating VD, CIVD, and PD into a single loss function. Questions remain regarding whether the label y is generated by substituting $d(\\cdot)$ in Equation 3 with $F(\\cdot)$, how the components are balanced, and whether this balance is sensitive to different datasets.\n- The paper lacks computational details on estimating key parameters ($\\mu, C, and~ v$) in the TTVD framework. More clarity on these calculations would enhance understanding of the implementation and reproducibility of TTVD."
