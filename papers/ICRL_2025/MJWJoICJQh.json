    "title": "Safety-Advanced Autonomous Driving for Urgent Hazardous Situations using Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic",
    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must be capable of safe driving under all conditions to ensure passenger safety. This includes urgent hazardous situations (UHS), such as skidding on slippery roads or tire grip saturation during high-speed driving, which are not only difficult even for expert human drivers but also challenging to develop autonomous driving technologies that surpass human capabilities. Even though the recent advancements in machine learning including imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL), and hybrid learning (HL) have enabled the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles in various complex scenarios, they have fundamental limitations in UHS. Driving policies trained via IL degrade in novel situations where expert demonstration data is scarce or of poor quality, and RL struggles to develop optimal driving policies in UHS, which have broad state and action spaces and high transition variance. HL techniques combining IL and RL also fall short, as they require nearly optimal demonstration data, which is nearly impossible to obtain in UHS due to the difficulty for human drivers to react appropriately.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel HL technique, Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), which effectively utilizes immature demonstration data to develop optimal driving policies and adapt quickly to novel situations in UHS. QC-SAC evaluates the quality of demonstration data based on action value Q to prioritize beneficial data and disregard detrimental ones. Furthermore, QC-SAC improves the performance of the Q-network by leveraging demonstration data and enhances learning by rapidly incorporating new successful experiences from ongoing interactions, enabling fast adaptation to new situations. We test QC-SAC for two extreme UHS scenarios: oversteer control with collision avoidance (OCCA) and time-trial race (TTR). In OCCA, QC-SAC achieves a success rate 2.36 times higher than existing techniques, and in TTR, it reduces lap time by more than 13.6\\% while completing 300 test runs without a single failure. By proposing an innovative HL technique capable of training superior driving policies with immature demonstration data, we provide a solution for autonomous driving technologies that can handle UHS and introduce the world-first safe-advanced autonomous driving technology capable of controlling a vehicle oversteer safely and avoiding obstacles ahead.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The first concern is whether the proposed method has been fairly evaluated with the baselines. The title and main introduction suggest the focus is solving the urgent hazardous situations in autonomous driving. With that as the focus, only 3 general learning-based methods are compared as baselines, which may not stand as a fair comparison. The experiments should provide a comparison between SOTA methods for this domain rather than those basic methods. For example, for the second evaluated task: the time-trial race, there are lots of different methods in the literature that can solve the problem well, for example [1-3]. Those methods also proposed their own \"learning tricks\" to solve the problem. It is essential to provide a comparison to show why the proposed add-ons to the SAC are better than those in the literature.\n\nThe second concern is about the limitation of evaluated scenes. The current experiments are limited in cases. For the OCCA, there could be different cases in which oversteering may happen. The proposed method only trained in one scene with some randomization on obstacles. There is no evaluation of different scenes. For example, now the scene is on a straight road, what will happen if it is on a curve or with a different width or more obstacles? Do I need to train the policy over all possible scenes? Will it be possible to encode that map info and build a general policy that works on novel scenes? As a method for solving OCCA, it is essential to answer those questions. Otherwise, it would be more like a benchmark task for evaluating learning methods rather than evaluating for solving the task.\n\nWith these two mentioned concerns, it is worth noting that as a paper for handling urgent hazardous situations in autonomous driving, the paper lacks sufficient problem formulation and system modeling. Section 2 is more like a general introduction rather than a mathematical problem formulation and modeling. The main method in the paper is also not a domain-specific method. Therefore, the whole structure of the paper is more like proposing a generic learning method for solving hard tasks rather than focusing on solving the urgent hazardous situations in autonomous driving. If the author presents the work as a generic learning method for solving hard tasks, the current baseline result with one or two more SOTA IL+RL methods [4-7] may be enough in some sense, and the current scenes in OCCA and TTA are also enough to show the ability of the proposed method in the driving domain. However, if that is the focus, the experiments should include different applications from different domains, and the title and whole introduction should be changed, which I don't think is a feasible track for the current submissions. But the current way of presenting is definitely not a good fit.\n\nThe third concern is about theoretical soundness. The proposed method uses eq. (5) and eq. (6) to learn the critic. However, these equations are from SAC and are only correct if the policy is the target policy of SAC which is the max-entropy policy. Since the learning target of the current policy has been changed to a mix of the SAC target with a BC target, the math has changed. Thus, eq. (5) and eq. (6) are not the Q function for the current optimization target. It is OK to have a biased learning target. But it is necessary to discuss the reason why we would like to do that, what is the benefit, and what is correct math. Meanwhile, the BC target needs Q to obtain the weight. It is clear that at the beginning the Q net is not accurate and thus the weight would also be wrong. It is also important to discuss if this will cause the training unstable and why. However, the paper misses those discussions about math and proof.\n\nThe last concern is about the novelty. The proposed method is pretty similar to the BC-SAC method. The method in this paper just changes the learning target of the added BC target and adds some learning tricks (QNfD, SDDU). The current results also show that the performance of BC-SAC and QC-SAC are pretty similar. They both perform similarly well with QNfD and SDDU on and similarly bad with QNfD and SDDU off. These do show the contribution of the proposed QNfD and SDDU. But I feel the main methods are still the same (BC-SAC also has the theoretical soundness concern as I mentioned above). \n\nWith all these concerns, I think the author probably needs to rethink their way of presenting the method and probably go for another opportunity to publish.\n\nHere is the summarized list of the missed content:\n\n1. The experiment lacks enough baseline methods especially those SOTA methods in the focused task, for example, SOTA in the autonomous racing domain.\n2. The experiment lacks enough scenarios, including different OCCA scenes and discussion about the performance in novel scenes and different racing tracks for the TTA tasks, which makes the evaluation more like a benchmark task for evaluating general RL IL learning methods rather than truly evaluating if the focused task is solved.  \n3. The experiment lacks enough detail about parameters for the training and demonstration dataset, e.g. for OCCA, are they all successful, or do they only contain the oversteer part? It is hard to say whether the poor result of the baseline methods is due to parameter tuning or the method itself, especially given sufficient papers in the literature showing SAC does solve the TTR task.\n4. The method lacks theoretical soundness. As mentioned in the above, the equation seems to be wrong or biased in theory. The weight also depends on Q net which is definitely biased at the beginning. However, there is no discussion or proof about those details.\n5. The method lacks enough novelty. Compared with BC-SAC, the method in this paper just changes the learning target of the added BC target and adds some learning tricks (QNfD, SDDU). \n\n[1] Wurman, Peter R., et al. \"Outracing champion Gran Turismo drivers with deep reinforcement learning.\" *Nature* 602.7896 (2022): 223-228.\n\n[2] Vasco, Miguel, et al. \"A Super-human Vision-based Reinforcement Learning Agent for Autonomous Racing in Gran Turismo.\" REINFORCEMENT LEARNING CONFERENCE (RLC) (2024).\n\n[3] Hao, Ce, et al. \"Skill-Critic: Refining Learned Skills for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.\" *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters* (2024).\n\n[4] Hester, Todd, et al. \"Deep q-learning from demonstrations.\" *Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence*.

As the method doesn't require a task-specific algorithm/reward design, I believe it has such potential.\n\nAs a learning-conference, ICLR values the generalizability of the method. Thus, I would expect it to work well in many standard benchmarks first (Though the RL benchmark is not as standard as those used by CV people) and the oversteering setting only serves as an interesting case study.  In addition, the paper writing should be adjusted to cover a wide scope not limited to USH for car driving. If this method remains a solution for a certain kind of problem (vehicle oversteering/understeering), ICRA/ITSC would be more suitable for this manuscript."
