    "abstract": "Heterogeneous multi-robot systems (HMRS) have emerged as a powerful ap-\nproach for tackling complex tasks that single robots cannot manage alone. Current\nlarge-language-model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-based MAS) have shown\nsuccess in areas like software development and operating systems, but applying\nthese systems to robot control presents unique challenges. In particular, the ca-\npabilities of each agent in a multi-robot system are inherently tied to the physical\ncomposition of the robots, rather than predefined roles. To address this issue,\nwe introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to enable effective collab-\noration among heterogeneous robots with varying embodiments and capabilities,\nalong with a new benchmark named Habitat-MAS. One of our key designs is\nRobot Resume: Instead of adopting human-designed role play, we propose a self-\nprompted approach, where agents comprehend robot URDF files and call robot\nkinematics tools to generate descriptions of their physics capabilities to guide\ntheir behavior in task planning and action execution. The Habitat-MAS bench-\nmark is designed to assess how a multi-agent framework handles tasks that require\nembodiment-aware reasoning, which includes 1) manipulation, 2) perception, 3)\nnavigation, and 4) comprehensive multi-floor object rearrangement. The experi-\nmental results indicate that the robot\u2019s resume and the hierarchical design of our\nmulti-agent system are essential for the effective operation of the heterogeneous\nmulti-robot system within this intricate problem context.",

In essence, it describes a system with multiple robots, each equipped with an LLM and distinct capabilities. The robots communicate to determine task distribution, using robot resumes to identify which robot is best suited for each task. Through hierarchical and decentralized planning, they collaborate to complete complex tasks in a shared environment, leveraging spatial reasoning and embodiment awareness to enhance coordination."

While this is an interesting application of LLMs, it falls short of introducing fundamentally new methods or algorithms. Rather than solely focusing on prompt engineering or question-passing techniques, the authors could explore adapting the LLM architecture specifically for the multi-robot system's needs. For example, a custom fine-tuning approach that allows the LLM to handle complex, multi-agent task decomposition and task dependencies uniquely suited to heterogeneous robots would provide more significant technical innovation.\n2) Habitat-MAS simulation: It is a modification of the Habitat framework; the contribution is more of a system engineering effort than a machine learning breakthrough. \n3) Presenting results is not a contribution. Instead, it serves as a validation that the proposed methodology works as intended and is better than baselines. \nBased on the first two contributions, I would recommend the authors to submit it for a Robotics conference. Really sorry, I have to give a reject."

This framework integrates recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models, enabling intelligent cooperation among multiple robots. Unlike previous works, which primarily relied on role-playing approaches, this multi-agent framework innovatively proposes a robot resume based on the robot's URDF files. This enhancement allows for a more precise description of the robots' capabilities, thereby facilitating more efficient communication and collaboration among them. Additionally, the authors present a new benchmark named Habitat-MAS. This benchmark validates the framework's effectiveness.

            "summary": {
                "value": "The paper presents an interesting approach to LLM-based multi-robot systems where robot roles are not predefined but are instead determined dynamically based on the robots' physical capabilities. The authors introduce the concept of a \"robot resume,\" generated from robot URDF files and kinematic data, to guide task planning and integrate role flexibility within the model.\n\nThis concept is very compelling; however, my main concern is the additional degree(s) of freedom introduced into the decision-making and planning. In systems with predefined/assumed heterogeneous roles, the answer to \u201cwho does what\u201d is partially predetermined, simplifying the planning process. Here, this isn\u2019t the case, and the current centralized hierarchical LLM-based planning and task assignment system becomes significantly constrained. With the current design, the centralized planner and task assignment modules will face considerable burden in optimizing plans and assignments, particularly as domain complexity increases or when dealing with similar or more universally capable robots. I suggest comparing your approach against systems with predefined roles to illustrate any potential advantages or limitations. Additionally, you can provide a quantitative analysis of how your system's performance scales with increasing numbers of robots, robot classes, or task complexity (see [1] for example).\n\n[1] Seraj et al. \"Learning efficient diverse communication for cooperative heterogeneous teaming\", AAMAS 2022\n\nOne potential solution to mitigate this issue could involve incorporating prior knowledge to streamline planning and decision-making. For example, a standard quadcopter lacks object manipulation capabilities, so it can be automatically excluded from relevant tasks, reducing the computational load. Such prior knowledge could be represented as a context/class vector for a contextual classification. Additionally, other factors such as robot availability (i.e., whether a robot is still executing a prior task) could contribute to a truly asynchronous multi-robot system.\n\nI also have a few questions:\n- Can you discuss the modularity of this approach? For instance, can you describe the process for adding a new capability like battery life to the robot resume and how it would be integrated into the task planning and allocation process. This would give a clearer picture of the system's modularity and extensibility.\n- Do LLM-based planners consider assignment risks, and if so, how can these risks be leveraged in the decision-making process?\n- It remains unclear how the central planner optimizes \"which robot does what.\" For example, how does the system handle scenarios with (1) multiple equally capable robots, (2) differently capable robots that can all execute a task, or (3) universally capable robots? Does the LLM-based \u201cdiscussion\u201d incorporate strategic negotiation or cognitive hierarchy mechanisms (e.g., k-level thinking) to optimize plans and assignments? Can you provide a specific example scenario for each of these cases and explain how the system would handle the allocation in each case?\n- Given the dynamic nature of the environment, assuming full observability is unrealistic. However, it is also unclear how partial observability is handled in this system. Can you discuss how your system might be adapted to handle partial observability, and what challenges you anticipate in doing so?\n\nAdditionally, I suggest including a section on Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems literature rather than the current Multi-Robot Systems section. Given the context of this work, it would be more impactful to emphasize on the heterogeneity in collaborative multi-robot teams, categorizing and introducing previous approaches such as MARL (heterogeneous multi-robot communication and coordination), Multi-Agent Apprenticeship Learning (learning heterogeneous multi-robot policies from human demonstrations), trait-based heterogenous multi-robot planning, and other non-LLM-based strategies. Below are a list of papers to begin with:\n\n[1] \"Learning efficient diverse communication for cooperative heterogeneous teaming\", AAMAS 2022\n\n[2] \"Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Reinforcement Learning\", AAMAS 2022\n\n[3] \"STRATA: A Unified Framework for Task Assignments in Large Teams of Heterogeneous Agents\", JAAMAS 2020\n\n[4] \"Mixed-initiative multiagent apprenticeship learning for human training of robot teams\", NeurIPS 2023\n\n[5] \"Heterogeneous policy networks for composite robot team communication and coordination\", T-RO 2024\n\nLastly, a minor but important point: the paper contains numerous grammatical and verbal errors. A thorough review is recommended. \n\nOverall, I'm happy with the contributions made in this paper and vote for a weak accept. I'd be happy to raise my score given mine and my fellow reviewers' comments are adequately addressed. Thanks!"
