    "title": "Patch-Wise Automatic Segmentation for Real-Time PCB Inspection",
    "abstract": "Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) systems play a pivotal role in ensuring quality control during Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing. However, the current AOI systems necessitate manual setting of the region of interest (ROI) for all components. To address this, we propose a patch-based preprocessing technique, dividing high-resolution PCB images into small 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel patches and employing the YOLOv7 segmentation model for real-time component ROI segmentation. Our method consistently delivered high accuracy across various PCB components, irrespective of background color, and demonstrated robust performance even with complex structures containing small components. It achieved impressive outcomes, with an average IoU, F1 score, pixel accuracy, and mAP of 0.8889, 0.9401, 0.9961, and 0.8255, respectively. Specifically, utilizing Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation Network (PAN) in YOLOv7's multi-resolution processing allowed us to accurately segment PCB components of various sizes and process them in real-time. This study underscores the potential of automating real-time component ROI segmentation in the PCB manufacturing process to enhance production speed and quality control.",

Additionally, splitting and patching high-resolution images into smaller tiles is a widely used, conventional technique, which further limits the originality of the approach.\n- Given the goal of processing high-resolution images, the authors should provide stronger justification for selecting YOLOv7 as the core model. It would be beneficial to discuss why this choice is preferable over more recent or specialized methods, especially considering recent advancements.\n\n# Experiment\n- The comparison benchmarks in the experimental section are outdated. Including evaluations against state-of-the-art transformer-based detectors or segmentors, such as DETR, SAM or DINOv2 is essential.\n- Moreover, comparisons with recent methods specifically targeting small object detection should be added to SOTA table."

Numerous studies focus on this topic, with many published in industrial intelligence journals such as TII, TIE, TIM, TSM, JMS, JMP, JIM, IJAMT, etc.\n2. The method lacks innovation, as the use of image patching combined with YOLO detection is already a well-established engineering solution. The novelty could be weaker than papers from the mentioned journals.\n3. The experimental validation does not utilize existing publicly available PCB defect detection datasets, which limits the robustness of the findings.\n4. Overall, the quality doesn't match ICLR. Suggesting submitting to industry-related journals after careful improvements."

Since this work is not the first to offer segmentation on PCB images, it needs to be compared to the works to be evaluated properly.\nHere is only a short list of such segmentation works for PCB images:\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9721901\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423005316?casa_token=Shzl_BwIRDAAAAAA:_m9fw8RWrpezvvyzvQE7aXALKORhVHhVvsPpQnzQ9xKXtWE-_BEmHwXCupJxYw6rouNlWw4_\n\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622859&casa_token=W8IwkaZqz94AAAAA:53AiF7a8-rUUKlCJJEqF-2QcbAQIWPhIqsyTq4Z_5uC0_6tpSp6QdeUtrmsAiWp2CO7Odl42\n\n2. I wasn't able to find anything novel in this work. Applying sliding-window as a pre-processing step is obviously not new (in terms of general images as well as on PCB images), and is presented in this work as something novel and one of the contributions of the work. Utilizing another known architecture and tuning it to a private dataset also does not seem novel to me.\n\nThere is lots of text redundancy specifically in the Methodology section. The patch-wise preprocessing step subsection, could have been presented as \"we applied sliding-window with the following parameters ...\" and that differently from other domains, all patches can be used since all of them contain important PCB components (as you stated). The YOLOv7 Segmentation subsection feels like another related work section. It looks like another survey of that work."
