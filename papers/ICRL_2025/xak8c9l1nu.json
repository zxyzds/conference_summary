For distributions with compact descriptions, calculating TV-distance poses significant challenges, as the direct approach incurs exponential time complexity relative to input size.

                "value": "The main contribution of this paper is the first result: deciding whether two mixtures of product distributions are the same. Suppose we have $k$ product distributions $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$, where each $P_i$ is an $n$-dimensional product distribution, i.e., $X \\sim P_i$ is a vector $(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$. The paper takes the prefix of $X$, namely $X^{\\leq j} = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_j)$ for $j \\leq n$. This distribution is denoted by $P^{\\leq j}_i$. Then, they consider the mixture of $P^{\\leq j}_1, P^{\\leq j}_2, \\ldots, P^{\\leq j}_k$, denoted by $P^{\\leq j}$. The algorithm decides whether $P^{\\leq j}$ and $Q^{\\leq j}$ are the same for all $j$. The algorithm is based on induction from $j = 1$ to $j = n$. The base case is trivial. The difficult part is that for $P^{\\leq j}$ and $Q^{\\leq j}$, the support of the distribution can be as large as $\\exp(\\Omega(j))$. To reduce the computational cost, the algorithm finds a \"sketch\" of the two distributions. One needs to check whether $P^{\\leq j}(x) = Q^{\\leq j}(x)$ for exponentially many $x \\in \\Sigma^{j}$. For each $x$, the algorithm views $P^{\\leq j}(x) = Q^{\\leq j}(x)$ as a linear equation. Instead of checking an exponential number of linear equations, the algorithm finds a basis of the linear system, and the size of the basis is $\\text{poly}(n)$. Then the algorithm only need to check the equations in the basis.\n\nOverall, the algorithm and the definition of $P^{\\leq j},Q^{\\leq j}$ are simple and clever, and I think deciding whether two mixtures of product distributions are the same is a basic problem in statistics."

The result holds, however, because $ P = \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i P_i^{\\leq n} $ and $ Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k v_i Q_i^{\\leq n} $, so if $ P \\neq Q $, then $ \\sum_{i=1}^k w_i P_i^{\\leq j} \\neq \\sum_{i=1}^k v_i Q_i^{\\leq j} $ for at least $ j = n $.\n\nFor line 451, it should be $ \\delta x_0 x_1 \\to \\delta x_0 x_k $. Additionally, some of the calculations in lines 441\u2013458 are straightforward, so a few lines could be removed to streamline the presentation.\n\nIn the proof of Proposition 7, when setting parameters, it would be helpful to specify how small the parameter $ \\eta_0 $ ( and $h_0,\\delta$) needs to be to ensure that the relative error of the marginal probability remains smaller than $ O(\\epsilon / n) $. Could you clarify why machine precision is considered here? Would $ \\mathrm{poly}(N / \\epsilon) $ bits suffice to represent $ \\eta_0 $, where $ N $ denotes the input size?"

                "value": "The paper has two main contributions: (1) An algorithm for checking equivalence for mixtures of product distributions (2) A hardness reduction for approximating the total variation distance between two Ising models.\n\nThe problem of checking equivalence of product distributions is takes the following as input: we are given $w_1,\\cdots, w_k, P_1,\\cdots,P_k$ and $v_1,\\cdots, v_k, Q_1,\\cdots,Q_k$ where:\n1) Each of $P_1,\\cdots,P_k$ and $Q_1,\\cdots,Q_k$ is a product distribution over $\\Sigma^n$.\n2) $w_1,\\cdots, w_k$ are the weights for $P_1,\\cdots,P_k$ and $v_1,\\cdots, v_k$ are the weights for $Q_1,\\cdots,Q_k$.\nSo, the first distribution $P$ is the mixture of $P_1,\\cdots,P_k$ each weighted by  $w_1,\\cdots, w_k$  and the second distribution $Q$ is the mixture of $Q_1,\\cdots,Q_k$ each weighted by  $v_1,\\cdots, v_k$. The task is to determine wether the two mixture distributions are the same.\n\nHere is an example (from page 2) an equal mixture of $Bern(1/3)$ and $Bern(2/3)$ equals to the distribution $Bern(1/2)$. This illustrates how a mixture of two product distributions can equal a different product distribution.\n\nThe paper gives a deterministic algorithm whose run-time is $O(nk^4 |\\Sigma|^4)$ which is polynomial in the input size which equals $kn|\\Sigma|$. One idea the algorithm uses is that if the two mixtures $w_1P_1+,\\cdots, +P_kw_k$ and $v_1Q_1+,\\cdots, +v_k Q_k$ are equal, then (after a normalization) the mixtures $w_1P_1+,\\cdots, +P_jw_j$ and $v_1Q_1+,\\cdots, +v_j Q_j$ are also equal for every $j$. The algorithm utilizes the idea by iteratively establishing equivalence for $j=1,2..., k$ at every step $j$ establishing equivalence for $j+1$ assuming equivalence for $j$ (or to find some $x$ for which the probabilities of two distributions differ). As the paper shows, such steps can be achieved by keeping track of bases for solutions of certain types of equations.\n\nIsing models are a fundamental family of probability distributions over $\\{\\pm 1\\}^n$. Probability of each $x$ in $\\{\\pm 1\\}^n$ is proportional to $\\exp(P(x))$ where $P$ is a degree-2 multilinear polynomial. Ising models are a very well-studied family of distributions modeling systems for which random features have only pairwise interactions (this is because each term in $P$ has at most two variables). \n\nA Fully Polynomial-time Randomized Approximation scheme FPRAS is a randomized algorithm that gives a multiplicative $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to a desired quantity. Here, this means that one is given a pair of degree-2 polynomials $P_1$ and $P_2$ describing a pair of Ising models, and the goal of the algorithm is to output a multiplicative $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to the TV distance between the pair of Ising models. The paper shows that no poly-time algorithm can achieve this task (under a basic complexity-theoretic assumption).\n\nThe hardness proof proceeds by developing an approximation-preserving reduction to the problem of approximating the partition function of an Ising model, which is known from previous work to be hard to approximate. As an intermediate step, the reduction goes through the problem of approximating the marginal of an Ising-model distribution on one of the coordinates $x_i$ (this is referred to as the problem of approximating the atomic marginal)."
