    "abstract": "The Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure based on iterative reciprocal and Markovian projections has recently been proposed as a powerful method for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problem. However, it has been observed that for the practical implementation of this procedure, it is crucial to alternate between fitting a forward and backward time diffusion at each iteration. Such implementation is thought to be a practical heuristic, which is required to stabilize training and obtain good results in applications such as unpaired domain translation. In our work, we show that this heuristic closely connects with the pioneer approaches for the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Namely, we find that the practical implementation of IMF is, in fact, a combination of IMF and IPF procedures, and we call this combination the Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting (IPMF) procedure. We show both theoretically and practically that this combined IPMF procedure can converge under more general settings, thus, showing that the IPMF procedure opens a door towards developing a unified framework for solving Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge problems.",

                "value": "In the context of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (SB) problems, the paper analyses theoretically some heuristic algorithms typically used in practice in the literature. Specifically, the authors give a new interpretation to these heuristics, as a combination of well-known procedures used in the context of theoretical analysis of SB problems. The authors name the resulting procedure \"Iterative Proportional Markov Fitting\" (IPMF).\n\nThe main result of the paper is to show the converge of IPMF when both the distributions $p_0$ and $p_1$ are unidimensional gaussians.\nFurthermore, the authors study heuristically the convergence of IPMF in more interesting settings, by performing numerical experiments on some typical datasets and benchmarks."

This scheme performs Markovian and reciprocal projections in order to find the Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT). A much older scheme to find EOT is Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) [3, 4]. The authors propose to reinterpret a popular implementation of IMF with forward/backward projections to link this specific IMF implementation with the IPF algorithm. The procedure is called IPMF (Iterative Proportional Markovian Fitting). They show that the proposed procedure converges for one-dimensional Gaussian targets. They then illustrate experimentally the stability of the forward/backward implementation of IMF, i.e. IPMF, for several starting couplings including some that do not satisfy the requirements of IMF and IPF.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* I think the paper has limited novelty. Indeed, the link between the IMF procedure and the IPF was already identified in  [1]. In particular, in [1] the following coupling \u201cWe now relate Algorithm 1 to the classical IPF and practical algorithms such as DSB (De Bortoli et al., 2021). Instead of initializing DSBM with $\\Pi_{0,T}^0$ given by a coupling between $\\pi_0, \\pi_1$ , if we initialize it by $\\Pi_{0,T}^0 = \\mathbb{Q}_{0,T}$ [...] then DSBM also recovers the IPF iterates used in DSB.\u201d Hence the connection between IMF and IPF through the initial coupling was already acknowledged in [1], see Proposition 10 for an explicit statement. In that regard, the IPMF rewriting is not needed to show that the IMF procedure reverts to the IPF one when the coupling is initialized as the IPF one which is one of the main points of the paper. \n\n* Overall I think the paper has limited impact. If it should be read as a theory paper then the result is quite weak (one dimensional Gaussian random variables) and there is not so much insight that is gained from the proof of the theorem, i.e. it seems extremely unclear that the proof generalizes to other settings and what would be a path to reach such general convergence results. If the paper is to be seen as a methodology paper then I think that there should be a clear motivation to choose couplings that are different from the ones of the IMF (i.e. couplings with correct marginals) or the ones from the IPF (couplings with first right marginal and output of the Brownian motion or related stochastic process). So far, I do not see in the paper a clear use case of such couplings. Hence I find the paper poorly motivated.\n\n* Finally, I find the experiments to be quite poor. The only settings that are run are high dimensional Gaussians, 2d examples and unpaired image translation with colored MNIST and Celeba. I found the quantitative study of the last two experiments to be quite poor. For instance, FID scores are presented in Figure 5 and MSE are presented in Appendix C.2 and in that case it seems that changing the coupling yields worse results regarding the quality of the obtained coupling. I think, the authors should investigate other couplings (I know that the minibatch OT one was investigated in the case of Celeba) in order to show that there is something to be gained from the IPMF perspective."

However, I could not find such a result in [1, 2]. To the best of my knowledge, the theoretical study of the IMF is quite limited. \n\n* In Equation (9) and Equation (10) the forward and backward are done successively. Do you think it is possible to learn the backward and forward processes jointly? Is there any work investigating that direction? In that case, it would be interesting to understand the IPMF in that setting.\n\n* It would be good to have some kind of diagram to illustrate the differences between IMF, IPF and IPMF as well as some explicit descriptions on when they are equal. Basically, the choice of the initial coupling matters a lot. If the initial coupling in the IPMF has the right marginals (and is in the reciprocal class) then we recover the IMF. If the initial coupling in the IPMF is Markov in the reciprocal class and has the right initial marginal then we recover the IPF. \n\n* What other starting coupling could be explored? This is related to my comment regarding the lack of applications in the \u201cWeaknesses\u201d section. \n\n* I want to point out that in Section 3.1. The rewriting of the IPMF is only meaningful if we start from a coupling that does not preserve the marginals, otherwise since the Markovian projection preserves the marginal there is no point applying the projection on the last marginal (or the first marginal). I think it is necessary to specify this. \n\n* It would be interesting to investigate what is the effect of approximating the projection in the convergence of the IMF, the IPF and the IPMF, similarly as in [3].\n\n[1] Shi et al. \u2013 Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching\n\n[2] Peluchetti \u2013 Diffusion Bridge Mixture Transports, Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Problems and Generative Modeling\n\n[3] Chen et al. \u2013 Provably Convergent Schr \u0308odinger Bridge with Applications to Probabilistic\nTime Series Imputation"
