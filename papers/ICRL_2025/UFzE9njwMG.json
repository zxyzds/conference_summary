    "abstract": "In the field of weather forecasting, traditional models often grapple with discretization errors and time-dependent source discrepancies, which limit their predictive performance. In this paper, we present WeatherODE, a novel one-stage, physics-driven ordinary differential equation (ODE) model designed to enhance weather forecasting accuracy. By leveraging wave equation theory and integrating a time-dependent source model, WeatherODE effectively addresses the challenges associated with time-discretization error and dynamic atmospheric processes. Moreover, we design a CNN-ViT-CNN sandwich structure, facilitating efficient learning dynamics tailored for distinct yet interrelated tasks with varying optimization biases in advection equation estimation. Through rigorous experiments, WeatherODE demonstrates superior performance in both global and regional weather forecasting tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins of over 40.0\\% and 31.8\\% in root mean square error (RMSE), respectively.

                "value": "Let me start off by saying that using an advection equation is only valid under __very simplified scenario__, and weather dynamics is definitely not the case at all. Elaborations to follow:\n\n1. The paper assumes incompressible fluid, where fluid density remains static along the pressure level. This is a gross simplification and is unphysical as the weather dynamics is completely dependent on the fluid being compressible, to allow interesting processes to take place such as convection through buoyancy (cloud formation, precipitation, energy-water cycling), large-scale fluid motion (teleconnection), turbulence (boundary-layer interaction), etc. This very assumption, therefore, does not allow for many atmospheric phenomena, including but not limited to extreme events (ENSO, hurricanes, etc), or just the general circulation of the atmosphere. This is not including the paper's simplification of ignoring the spherical nature of the Earth that enables for a different set of dynamics enabled by e.g., coriolis force.\n\n2. The paper also ignores many important conservation constraints found in the classical dynamical core, such as the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. \n\n3. As such, there are better approximation to the full Navier-Stokes equation, such as Shallow Water Equation or Quasi-Geostrophic flow, that attempts to capture some of the realism of the atmosphere, and is therefore a much better differentials than the advection equation. \n\nRegardless, there are additional weaknesses that warrant a reject rating:\n\n4. The limited number of variables used (5), coarse spatial resolution (5.625-degree vs 0.25; ~400x smaller horizontal resolution), and small forecasting lead-time (72-hour) are too unconvincing to test this Neural ODE formulation for real weather application. I suspect that given the gross oversimplification through the advection equation, the framework could not accurately evolve the full atmospheric state with significant vertical motion/interaction, and is therefore not useful in a short forecasting window, let alone over a longer rollout in the medium-weather and longer sub-seasonal scale. \n\n5.  This is echoed by the result in Appendix E Table 9 is inferior to ClimaX at 3-day lead time, with error growth much larger than the other model (also lacking IFS baseline here to see how the rate of error propagation). The ACC for for u10, for instance, deteriorates from 0.93 to 0.80 even at 36-hour difference! The fundamental error in the assumptions (which ClimODE is too, and the authors should therefore use stronger baselines such as GraphCast) might contribute to this result. \n\nOverall, the basic assumptions underpinning this ODE is over-simplistic and does not represent realistic atmosphere (e.g., no vertical motion, no conservation constraints). If the goal is to model a simplified flow, such as tracer dynamics where their evolution is passive e.g., does not have any feedback loop with other quantities, and local, then advection might be sufficient. But the atmosphere is definitely not the case. Also, the inferior results over long lead-time, weak baseline, and the limited scope of the problem setup, need more significant work."

A CNN-based neural network is used to predict the initial velocity of the equation, leveraging insights from the wave equation, rather than relying on time discretization.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the solid experimental results, I believe that the paper's explanation of the methodology lacks some clarity, context, and references. While the proposed architecture achieves strong performance, the scientific reasoning behind these improvements is somewhat incomplete.\n\nFirst, the authors claim that all physical variables follow an advection equation, which is learned. This assumption, initially made in the ClimODE model, forms the foundation of the WeatherODE architecture and is said to provide a strong physical bias. It would be beneficial if the paper provided more physical context regarding the advection equation and why it serves as a good prior for learning atmospheric dynamics. From a physical perspective, what are the consequences of assuming that all variables follow this equation with a learned velocity field? Can the authors connect this to known atmospheric processes?\n\n\n#### Section 3.1\n\nThere is some lack of clarity in the discussion of discretization between lines 192 and 204, particularly around Equation (3). It is unclear at which stage the ODE is being discretized. The problem of learning an ODE's flow using neural ODEs should, in theory, be independent of the discretization, as neural ODEs are designed to differentiate through the ODE in a solver-agnostic way.  Second, indices $t_0$ and $t_n$ seem to play the same role.  It would be clearer if a single notation were used for the initial condition, even if this involves only one discretization step, with the methodology then being extended to subsequent steps.\n\n####  Section 3.2\n\nThis section focuses on predicting the initial velocity $v(t_0)$. The authors provide physical insight on the computation of the state derivative $\\partial u/ \\partial t$. However, the link between the two quantities $v(t_0)$ and $\\partial u /\u00a0\\partial t$ is not explicitly stated. Yet it is one of the paper's main objectives to improve the computation of the $v$ as a function of the state $u$, without resorting to time discretization. Indeed, it is stated that $v$ is estimated from $u$ in the ClimODE paper using time discretization, but the estimation is never mentioned. As a result, the section presents a new method based on the wave equation to estimate state derivatives, but the connection with the ultimate problem of estimating the velocity is missing. This omission impairs the clarity of the paper, as this step is one of the core contribution.\nI understand that the estimation method is framed as a variational inverse problem in the ClimODE paper, and that WeatherODE improves it by casting it as a learning problem instead. I believe that it should be stated in this paper as well for Section 3.2 to be relevant. \n\nAdditionally, the link between the wave equation and the advection equation is not clearly explained. The authors mention that the wave equation is commonly used in atmospheric dynamics, but they do not provide any references or detailed physical context. While the wave equation is indeed important in describing physical processes related to propagation, further clarification is needed regarding its purpose in this model.\n\nIf I understood correctly, the integrated wave equation (5) seems to show that the first-order derivative of the state $\\partial u / \\partial t (t_0)$ is linked to the state gradients $\\nabla u(t_0)$, which motivates predicting the velocity field should as a function of the state gradients rather than the state itself. However, assuming that the wave equation holds, the involved spatial derivatives are of second order rather than first order, and are integrated over a past time interval rather than evaluated only at the current time $t_0$. In my opinion, and if I understood correctly, equation (5) may not be entirely appropriate for predicting $v(t_0)$ as described.\n\nThis concern is compounded by the results of Figure 3, where the performance gap between the proposed method using the wave equation and other approximators is quite small. Couldn't it be that the performance gap comes from learning the initial velocity from a neural network conditioned on non-discretized state values instead of solving an inverse problem with discretized state derivatives, rather than from the wave equation-informed predictive structure of the neural network? \n\nFinally, the qualitative argument about spatial resolution at the end of this section is not particularly convincing, as it compares spatial resolution to time resolution in a way that seems dimensionally inconsistent. The statement on line 243,\n``\nthe spatial domain is nearly 100 times denser than the temporal domain.\n ``\n\nneeds further clarification, as its implications are unclear."

Since computational power can often be a limiting factor, it would be valuable to compare the computational times across the different architectures, particularly for the neural ODE versus other feedforward models.\n\nThe WeatherODE* model appears to be an interesting research direction, offering flexibility in generating forecasts at different lead times. However, there is limited explanation as to why WeatherODE is capable of such flexibility. Could the authors clarify the connection between the following sentence:\n\n``\nby modeling the atmosphere as a physics-driven continuous process anddesigning a time-dependent source network to account for errors at each time step, WeatherODE can capture information across all intermediate time points\n``\n\n and the success of the 24-hour model WeatherODE*?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) I don't think ClimaX is a good baseline for such comparisons, as it was itself trained on a wide range of CMIP6 models which are (a) not really tuned for weather forecasting and (b) due to model design have multiple biases. Finetuning can only fix so many of them. Thus, I would not put too much weight into how the WeatherODE performs against ClimaX as it is a weak baseline to begin with. Similarly, I would recommend comparing the method with the newer version of FourCastNet based on the SFNO architecture which is more stable for short and long term rollouts and is more topology-aware.\n\n2) A minor point but the paper tends to over-cite at places: the Evans (2022) reference, the Vaswani et al reference and the Biswas et al. (2013) reference are totally unnecessary. Vaswani et al. has not even been cited in the correct context as it has not realtion to weather forecasting. Similarly on Line 37-38.\n\n3) The figures' text could be increased. It is tough to interpret Figures 1 and 4 in print.\n\n4) It would have been interesting to see the time complexity of the sandwich model proposed in the study and how it compares with other models. Current AI weather forecasting models have been a bit over-glorified in a sense that they ignore baroclinic motions in the atmosphere and use data on very few vertical levels, and then claim to be as good as traditional NWP models - which are way more versatile thab AI NWPs in the problems they can be used to solve. Understandably, the only advantage then is the computational speed and the reduction in operational cost that they offer. Therefore, as more traditional numerical are embedded into pure data-driven architectures, it would be interesting to see the effect on more complicated hybrid architectures on the run speed.\n\n5) If the refined horizontal resolution is the key here (as it allows computing spatial gradients accurately), they can simply using higher spatial resolution training data (like 25 km x 25 km ERA5 data) lead to similar improvements in performance?\n\n6) One worry is that the achitecture is becoming too combersome to be practical: a unified model structure for past AI NWP models is one of the key cornerstones of its appeal. Traditional NWP model provide forecasts at a 9 km resolution. If the same models were to be run at 5.625 deg resolution, one can expect similar order run times between AI weather emulators and NWP models, ultimately leading one to question the central point of these models. So, having multiple ML models in sequence, such as those proposed in this study, can increase the complexity of the problem to the point that one begins to question the novelty of this approach. What would have been great could be to train one single neural net on atmospheric data sampled at a high frquency and use that for more accurate initializations. \n\n7) If i undestand correctly, the study employs a two dimensional equation. Have the authors considered using a three dimensional equation instead which considers the vertical verlocity into account as well? This could be important especially for tropical predictability ad thermodynamical processes like dry and moist convection evolve over sub-hourly timescales and can introduce notable errors into the equation. This could also affect longer lead time rollouts of the model. Or, if I undertand it correctly, the vertical velocity is simply treated within the source term (which might not be the best approach).\n\n8) Source term: If I understand correctly, and I could be wrong, the source model tend to learn all the other forcing terms of the advection equation. In the context of ERA5, this would not just contain other forcings, but also data assimilation errors. Since the DA errors are not bery systematics in nature, how can errors in predicting the terms influence the u_t+1 prediction obtained from the neural ODEs?"

These two are not connected together, so I\u2019m left wondering what do we do with the waves, and how do they relate to the CNN. Furthermore, the wave equation is poorly motivated, and it seems disconnected from the advection equation 3. To me this looks like a discrepancy: the system follows advection, but initial state assumes different kind of physics (ie. laplacians appear out of nowhere). Surely the initial state estimation needs to respect the chosen ODE model, and not introduce some physics effects that are not part of the ODE.\n- The arguments about spatial vs temporal resolution are not convincing. Low temporal sampling rate does not necessarily mean that the temporal resolution is low: this depends on how quickly the process varies. It also feels misguided to say that spatial resolution is 100x higher than temporal resolution: this is only true if you take 32*64, and I don\u2019t think you should do this. Since the (t,x,y) axes have similar ranges (24,32,64), I would argue that there is no resolution gap in the sampling rate between space and time.\n- I couldn\u2019t follow the CNN/ViT convergence arguments. I\u2019m not sure what convergence even means here (of training..?, of rollouts..?). I think the paper is arguing that training CNNs is somehow instable, and thus ViT\u2019s have to be used. This sounds implausible, and a poor motivation for choosing how the dynamics should evolve. Surely the networks need to be chosen such that they respect some physical system properties (eg. feature locality/globality).\n- I don\u2019t understand the source model. It takes as input all 1\u2026N simulated states u(t_n), but one needs the source states s(t_n) to do this simulation. This has to be a mistake: I assume that we instead take as inputs u(t_1 : t_n), so that the history grows along the ODE rollouts. How do you handle set inputs and set outputs? I don\u2019t think a 3D CNN supports sets as inputs or outputs [maybe these are not sets, but just tensors of fixed size..].\n- At sec 3.5. I\u2019m again confused what do you mean by \u201cconvergence\u201d.\n- Sec 3.5. claims that advection dynamics involves long-range dependencies. I\u2019m not sure I agree, and would even argue the opposite. PDE\u2019s are by nature local models: why would the weather in new york affect the infinitesimal change of weather in london? There is no connection between them. Can you elaborate?\n- Sec 3.6. claims that earlier methods only train against final state, and ignore intermediate terms. I\u2019m surprised by this statement. ClimODE trains with all intermediate points, as does the original neural ODE, and every other neural ODE/PDE model I\u2019ve seen. Can you provide examples of models where this happens? Calling this \u201cmulti-task\u201d learning is also wrong: intermediate points in an ODE are not different \u201ctasks\u201d (they are not even a single repeated task, since it\u2019s not a \u201ctask\u201d in the first place).\n- The benchmarks use 48 weather variables, but only evaluate 5 of them. The benchmarks also take ClimODE results as-is from the paper at least in Table 2. The results are then unfair to ClimODE: the ClimODE is using only 5 variables worth of information, while weatherODE is using 48 variables. The paper needs compare apple to apples by either running weatherODE results using only 5 variables, or running ClimODE with 48 variables.\n\nI'm looking forward to the responses."
