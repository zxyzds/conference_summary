    "title": "Taming Continuous Spurious Shift in Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in domain adaptation have shown promise in transferring knowledge across domains characterized by a continuous value or vector, such as varying patient ages, where \"age'' serves as a continuous index. However, these approaches often fail when spurious features shift continuously along with the domain index. This paper introduces the first method designed to withstand the continuous shifting of spurious features during domain adaptation. Our method enhances domain adaptation performance by aligning causally transportable encodings across continuously indexed domains. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our approach more effectively ensures causal transportability across different domains. Empirical results, from both semi-synthetic and real-world medical datasets, indicate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.",

                "value": "1. The motivation of the problem setting is not well shown, and the novelty of the methodology is limited. The authors claimed to solve the causality model leaning under continuous distribution shift and attribute the challenge to the shifting spurious features. However, the proposed method is a simple combination of adversarial loss from CIDA [1] and causality learning from VOOD [2] without strategies specially designed for the proposed challenge. This suggests that existing methods can mitigate the proposed challenge. Moreover, in section 3.2, the authors only discussed the properties and assumptions of causal inference under distribution shift. No challenges specific to continuous setting are discussed.\n\n2. Many details and intuitions of the methodology are missing.\n\n  - Data statistics should be provided to provide a big picture of data distributions. For example, the number of patients in each domain and the label distribution in each subdomain should be provided.\n  - What is the intuition behind using probabilistic encoders instead of deterministic ones? What is the intuition behind using Gaussian distribution as P(r | x) and P(v | r, x')?\n  - The discriminator D(k | v) is a regressor for domain index k instead of predicted probability or distribution. How do the authors calculate log-likelihood from it?\n  - The proposed data sampler P(x') \"uniformly randomly samples data from different domains with different labels\". However, it is not clear how it can draw samples with different labels as we don't have access to labels in the target domain.\n\n3. Notations and concepts are not well introduced, therefore not easy to understand.\n\n  - The notations used in the manuscripts lack enough explanation and context for understanding. For example, although do-calculus is widely used in causal inference, there should be citations and brief introductions of the related concepts for better understanding, at least in the supplementary. The same applies to transportability, identifiability, front-door criterion, etc.\n  - The proof of the proposed theorems is very abstract. It is just a direct application of some existing definitions and conclusions on the specific causal graph in Figure 1. It's more like observations instead of theorems as it doesn't provide further insight into the problem setting or general conclusions.\n\n4. Experimental setting is not comprehensive.\n\n  - More recent baselines in continuous domain adaptation should be included for comparison, such as [3-6]\n  - The encoder is probabilistic, and Monte Carlo estimation is used for inference. How is the training stability for the proposed method, and how long will it take for inference compared to other methods? Ablation studies should also be conducted to evaluate the contribution of a probabilistic encoder.\n  - The authors proposed solving the continuous distribution shift problem. However, the domain in all reported experiments is discretized. Specifically, the COLORED-MNIST dataset is created in a discretized manner. It is not clear how this is different from the original domain adaptation. If the model is trained without discretization, some metrics should be designed to evaluate the performance in the continuous case.\n  - Given that we can discretize the domain index space, there should be another trivial baseline that conducts original domain adaptation methods pairwise for each target sub-domain.\n\n5. The implementation code is not available for reproduction.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Wang, H., He, H., & Katabi, D. (2020).

If you directly use 'age' as a feature, this is a domain adaptation problem with one source and one target and I would imagine the problem can be better solved.\n\nThe authors are clearly from the field of domain adaptation but it would be more helpful if they could carefully study the causal literature as well, and interpret the values of their work in the causal context."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Two key questions: \n\n1. What is the precise definition of 'spurious features'?\n\nIn the causal literature, there are variables such as interventions, confounders, mediators, moderators etc. But spurious feature is clearly not standard terminology. You need to define it explicitly.\n\nExample 1 is actually confusing. Why doesn\u2019t \u2018respiratory rate\u2019 work? It can still serve as a useful feature or a factor in prediction while including age as another factor. Then if you run a linear regression, it might still be good. It is questionable whether this feature is 'spurious' or not. In my opinion, it is more about including enough predictive variables to ensure that there is no hidden confounding, and about understanding the interaction between different features.\n\n2. From a high-level, how is the proposed method different from previous approaches in dealing with spurious features?\n\nMy understanding is that the authors proposed a more principled way to deal with continuously indexed domains via adversarial training using encoder and discriminator networks with a decent causal interpretation. Basically they still fall into the category of methods that use neural networks to extract invariant features across domains. So what is the clear contrast with previous approaches like CIDA? \n\nThey say that CIDA struggles to eliminate the influence of continuously shifting spurious features but as far as I am concerned what CIDA does is also extracting invariant features across domains. They don't necessarily exclude causal transportable representations. The fact that they didn't provide a causal interpretation does not imply that they are very different from the current work in respecting causal representations.\n\nTo be honest, I am also doubtful about the idea of eliminating spurious features to achieve invariant causal representations. As I have mentioned, the word 'spurious' is unclear. For some features, it might be more helpful to use them jointly with domain indexes rather than eliminating their effects.\n\n\nFurther points:\n\nLine 160 Page 3: I would suggest expanding this paragraph as is very important, and please also provide a definition of covariate shift. The concept of covariate shift has subtle connections to confoundedness in the causal context.\n\nI would also suggest the authors look at the line of works by Uri Shalit, David Sontag, Nathan Kallus etc. For example the following paper:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03976\nThey also connect causal representations with domain adaptation."
