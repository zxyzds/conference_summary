    "title": "Narcissus: Leveraging Early Training Dynamics for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a critical learning task with many significant and diverse applications. Currently, semi-supervised methods provide the state-of-the-art accuracy performance but require labeled normal data for training. Unsupervised approaches, on the other hand, do not have this requirement but can only offer inferior anomaly detection performance. In this paper, we introduce NARCISSUS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that achieves accuracy comparable to semi-supervised approaches. Our key insight is that a learning model when training with a mix of normal and sparse anomalous data converges first on normal data. Leveraging this insight, NARCISSUS employs a tailored early stopping scheme, eliminating the need for pseudo labels and costly label generation interactions. It also offers systematic solutions to minimize the influence of model uncertainty, ensuring robust detection. NARCISSUS is model-agnostic and can therefore make use of even a semi-supervised anomaly detection model underneath, thereby turning it into an unsupervised one. Comprehensive evaluations using time series, image and graph datasets show that NARCISSUS provides similar or better detection performance compared to best-performing semi-supervised methods while not requiring labeled data.",

                "value": "This paper presents NARCISSUS, which is a model-agnostic approach for unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series. Instead of relying on supervision signals, the proposed method excels in its capability of transforming any semi-supervised model into unsupervised with minimal adjustments, leveraging training dynamics to single out anomalous data without relying on labels or reconstruction error thresholds. Its key insight is simple but clever, that is, when training a model for some learning task on a mix of normal and anomalous data, the model converges faster on normal data while struggling to fit to anomalous data. Upon this insight, NARCISSUS uses early stopping to halt training before the model begins overfitting anomalies. The experiments are carried out over time series, image, and graph-based datasets, and empirical results show competitive or superior performance to semi-supervised baselines across various metrics, including AUC, F1 score, and precision."

                "value": "This paper aims to address how to perform unsupervised anomaly detection while ensuring high performance. The overall framework begins by viewing the task from a semi-supervised model, where the goal is to first train a model that can describe normal data using purely normal data. This pre-trained model is then used as a classifier, with the idea that a high reconstruction error indicates anomaly points. However, in an unsupervised scenario, we do not have labeled data, and thus, there is no pure normal data available. Consequently, the problem shifts to how to distinguish between normal and abnormal data within the dataset.\n\nIn this context, a phenomenon is observed: normal data allows the model to converge faster during the training process, while abnormal data contributes very little to the model's convergence. The authors aim to leverage this phenomenon to differentiate between abnormal data and to train the pre-trained model using only normal data.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of their method, the authors employ Robust VES (RVES), which enhances robustness by applying the VES procedure with multiple random validation sets. They compare NARCISSUS against various baselines, including unsupervised and semi-supervised methods, and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing detection methods across key metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC on widely used datasets. This establishes NARCISSUS as a strong approach for effective anomaly detection in unsupervised settings."

Is there an analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity to model performance?\n   - 1.2) Is the setting of hyperparameters influenced by the anomaly ratio in different datasets?\n   - 1.3) When comparing with baselines, are hyperparameters kept consistent?\n\n2. **Discussion of the Observed Phenomenon**\n   The core idea of this paper is based on the observation that \"the model converges faster on normal data while struggling to fit anomalous data.\"\n   - 2.1) What might be the underlying cause of this phenomenon?\n   - 2.2) Under what circumstances might this phenomenon fail to hold?\n\n3. **Motivation**\n   Overall, the performance of NARCISSUS relies heavily on its ability to identify abnormal data. Given this, I wonder why the authors chose not to use this method directly for anomaly detection rather than as a filtering step followed by pretraining. The two-stage approach (filtering then pretraining) seems to introduce added complexity, and a clearer rationale for this design choice would be helpful.\n   - 3.1) Is it possible to design an algorithm to perform anomaly detection directly by relying on convergence speed during the training process?\n   - 3.2) This comparison could clarify the advantages of NARCISSUS and reveal any trade-offs, such as differences in detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness across various data distributions.\n   - 3.3) An empirical evaluation of these alternatives could help illustrate cases where the two-stage method has clear benefits over a direct approach, providing a stronger justification for the current design."

However, this insight is not an original contribution of the paper. \nThe relationship between model training loss and data was first observed in the paper [1]. It explores the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), including loss values, when trained on normal and noisy data. Anomalies can be considered a type of noise, so both can be seen as studies of the same phenomenon. Specifically, Section 3.2 of paper [1] proposes using loss values to compare normal and noisy data. In Section 4, paper [1] concludes through extensive experiments that real data examples are easier to fit than noise, similar to the current submission.\n\nSubsequently, many new works have built on this finding to identify noise or anomalies in data, such as [2] and [3]. Paper [2] observes that noisy samples take longer to learn. Notably, Figure 1 in the paper [2] and Figure 1 in the current submission express almost the same conclusion and have a nearly identical presentation. Paper [3] introduces the concept of gradient norm to quantitatively describe the changes in loss on normal and noisy data. Therefore, this point cannot be considered a contribution of this paper. \n\nMoreover, using ensemble methods for anomaly detection is also a common practice and lacks originality. For example, paper [4] proposes using embedding methods for anomaly detection. In summary, this paper lacks innovation in its contributions.\nThe current research is limited to describing and utilizing the phenomenon. It could enhance its contribution if the paper provides more theoretical explanations.\n\n[1] A Closer Look at Memorization in Deep Networks.ICML.2017.\n\n[2] Unsupervised Label Noise Modeling and Loss Correction.ICML.2019\n\n[3] Gradient Harmonized Single-stage Detector.AAAI.2019.\n\n[4] An embedding approach to anomaly detection.ICDE.2016"
