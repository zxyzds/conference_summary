    "title": "Fragment and Geometry Aware Tokenization of Molecules for Structure-Based Drug Design Using Language Models",
    "abstract": "Structure-based drug design (SBDD) is crucial for developing specific and effective therapeutics against protein targets but remains challenging due to complex protein-ligand interactions and vast chemical space. Although language models (LMs) have excelled in natural language processing, their application in SBDD is underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a method, known as Frag2Seq, to apply LMs to SBDD by generating molecules in a fragment-based manner in which fragments correspond to functional modules. We transform 3D molecules into fragment-informed sequences using $SE(3)$-equivariant molecule and fragment local frames, extracting $SE(3)$-invariant sequences that preserve geometric information of 3D fragments. Furthermore, we incorporate protein pocket embeddings obtained from a pre-trained inverse folding model into the LMs via cross-attention to capture protein-ligand interaction, enabling effective target-aware molecule generation. Benefiting from employing LMs with fragment-based generation and effective protein context encoding, our model achieves the best performance on binding vina score and chemical properties such as QED and Lipinski, which shows our model\u2019s efficacy in generating drug-like ligands with higher binding affinity against target proteins. Moreover, our method also exhibits higher sampling efficiency compared to atom-based autoregressive and diffusion baselines with at most $\\times 300$ speedup.",

                "value": "The paper presents Frag2Seq, a method for structure-based drug design using language models (LMs) to generate drug-like molecules based on 3D fragments. By transforming 3D molecules into SE(3)-invariant sequences which can used with LMs, Frag2Seq captures essential geometric information. Additionally, it incorporates protein context through cross-attention with pre-trained protein embeddings, enabling effective target-aware molecule generation. Experiments show that Frag2Seq shows competitive performance against baselines in binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthesis accessibility, with sampling speeds up to 300 times faster than atom-based generative models."

This approach addresses a common limitation in SBDD by aligning molecular generation more closely with real-world drug discovery where small molecule and protein interactions play a vital role in binding.\n2. The SE(3)-invariant tokenization method preserves important 3D geometric information, offering a promising way to leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs. This geometric awareness could enhance accuracy in predicting drug-like properties, such as binding affinity and drug-likeness.\n3.  Frag2Seq demonstrates strong performance on metrics like binding affinity and drug-likeness while achieving up to 300x speedup over atom-based approaches."

For the models to be practically usable in applications like drug discovery, the scoring mechanism for generated molecules needs greater clarity on how specific molecular characteristics (e.g., fragment size, functional groups) influence metrics like vina scores. In other words the paper can focus a bit more on model interpretability.\n2. The fragment-based generation approach, which splits molecules by rotatable bonds while preserving rigid functional groups (e.g., hydroxy, carboxyl), may limit flexibility in positioning critical binding groups, potentially affecting target-specific binding. How robust are the fragmentation rules in Section 3.2?"

The use of SE(3)-invariant frames to encode the 3D structure of molecules, while effective, is a common approach in  protein structure design and thus does not introduce a significant innovation in this paper. The methodology primarily leverages the canonical ordering of SMILES strings to concatenate fragment sequences, which is a straightforward application. Similarly, the use of cross-attention to directly integrate protein and small molecule information is also quite direct. As a result, this work is more incremental in nature rather than presenting a breakthrough in methodology.\n2. In terms of input processing, the quantization of continuous structural information into discrete tokens results in a loss of precision. This could potentially affect the model's ability to capture fine-grained details of molecular structures. On the output side, the language model is unable to directly generate information about chemical bonds, which necessitates the use of additional models to infer this critical information. This dependency on secondary models for bond inference introduces an extra step in the generation process and may impact the overall coherence and accuracy of the generated molecules."

Please elaborate more on the rationality behind the experimental design to ensure that the performance of drug design is accurately assessed.\n2. Could you explain why a language model was chosen over other methods, such as 3D atom-based diffusion models, for the task of structure-based drug design? What are the theoretical and practical benefits?\n3. Is the direct use of cross-attention between the entire protein and molecule sequences a simplistic approach, or can experiments demonstrate that it effectively captures key information about the binding pocket?"
