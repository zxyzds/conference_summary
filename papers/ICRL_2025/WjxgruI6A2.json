    "title": "Hearing faces among homogeneous populations: improvement of cross-modal biometrics",
    "abstract": "The relationship between voice and face is well-established in neuroscience and biology. Recent algorithmic advancements have yielded substantial improvements in voice face matching. However, these approaches predominantly achieve success by leveraging datasets with diverse demographic characteristics, which inherently provide greater inter-speaker variability. We address the challenging problem of voice face matching and retrieval in homogeneous datasets, where speakers share gender and ethnicity. Our novel deep architecture, featuring a weighted triplet loss function based on face distances, achieves state-of-the-art performance for voice face matching on these uniform populations. We evaluate our model on a carefully curated homogeneous dataset containing  only the voices and faces of white males. In addition, we introduce percentile-recall, a new metric for evaluating voice face retrieval tasks.",

The authors mention for table 2 that \"1:2 accuracy on homogeneous data in present work compared to previous works.\" It is unclear what is meant by \"homogeneous data\". It appears that the metrics being reported are for the methods on different GNA-var removed datasets and NOT each method on the dataset that the authors introduced.\n2. If the above is in fact true, then this seems like a problem \u2013 different methods applied on different datasets cannot lead to a fair assessment of the proposed method. What is ideally needed, is the metrics of existing methods on the dataset that the authors propose for comparison.\n3. The authors correctly state that \"As Nagrani et al. (2018a) note, human performance deteriorates markedly when assessed on voice face matching of speakers sharing gender, ethnicity, or age group.\" However, Nagrani et al. (2018a) also report metrics (which I think are provided in table 2) with GNA-var removed. Now, I am unclear on the value the homogenous dataset introduced adds? Is it the size?\n4. If the answer to 3 is yes, then the key finding appears to be that training on more \"relevant\" data (or hard examples) is helpful. This itself as a contribution to the field seems weak in my opinion.\n5. The authors only target one demographic. There is no discussion on why this demographic was chosen. I believe it would be important for proving the efficacy by applying the method on different groups individually. I also believe that it would be interesting to see the resulting patterns as well as reduce bias.\n6. The network architecture diagram (Fig. 3) is very high level, and it could benefit with the addition of more details like layers, parameters, etc.\n7. Lacks implementation details like learning rate, number of layers, etc."
