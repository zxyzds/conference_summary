    "title": "Lightning-Fast Image Inversion and Editing for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion inversion is the problem of taking an image and a text prompt that describes it and finding a noise latent that would generate the exact same image. Most current deterministic inversion techniques operate by approximately solving an implicit equation and may converge slowly or yield poor reconstructed images.  We formulate the problem by finding the roots of an implicit equation and design a method to solve it efficiently. Our solution is based on Newton-Raphson (NR), a well-known technique in numerical analysis. We show that a vanilla application of NR is computationally infeasible while naively transforming it to a computationally tractable alternative tends to converge to out-of-distribution solutions, resulting poor reconstruction and editing. We therefore derive an efficient guided formulation that fastly converges and provides high-quality reconstructions and editing. We showcase our method on real image editing with three popular open-sourced diffusion models: Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo and Flux with different deterministic schedulers. Our solution, Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion, inverts an image within 0.4 sec (on an A100 GPU) for few-step models (SDXL-Turbo and Flux.1), opening the door for interactive image editing. We further show improved results in image interpolation and generation of rare objects.",

This would help to appeal the novelty.\n\n4. **Comparison with Anderson Acceleration**: Could you provide a detailed comparison between your guiding regularizer and Anderson acceleration (Pan et al., 2023), focusing on any key differences or improvements. Also, any extra analysis on the instability at $\\lambda=0$ would be useful.\n\n5. **Memory Usage Analysis**: Could you add a comparison of the memory usage of your method versus other approaches (Pan et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024), with some examples across different GPU sizes?\n\nIf these points are addressed, I would consider adjusting the score.

                "value": "This paper addresses diffusion inversion for fast and accurate inversion within text-to-image diffusion models. The authors propose Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion (GNRI), which leverages the Newton-Raphson (NR) numerical root-finding technique to achieve efficient and high-quality inversion. By constructing a modified DDIM inversion function as the target for NR and adding a guiding term, GNRI ensures convergence within the distribution of the latent space, overcoming common challenges in achieving accurate reconstructions. This approach supports tasks like real-time image editing, image interpolation, and rare concept generation, achieving significant speedups. The authors show that GNRI could invert images within 0.4 seconds on an A100 GPU while maintaining high fidelity, compared with popular diffusion models."

                "value": "Originality: This paper introduces a novel approach to the diffusion inversion problem by leveraging the Newton-Raphson (NR) root-finding method with two modifications: (1) dimensionality reduction via a scalar formulation of the Jacobian and (2) a guiding regularization term. By reframing inversion as a fixed-point iteration (FPI) problem with an $L_1$ norm relaxation, this work combines numerical optimization techniques with diffusion models, addressing limitations in accuracy and speed seen in prior methods. The addition of the regularization term prevents out-of-distribution solutions.\n\nQuality: The methodological foundation is rigorous, with well-defined derivations and justifications for each modification to the NR method. The paper also provides extensive empirical validation across multiple tasks, including image reconstruction, editing, interpolation, and rare concept generation. The inversion time to 0.4 seconds on an A100 GPU is impressive.\n\nClarity: The paper is generally clearly written and accessible. \n\nSignificance: GNRI addresses the problem of achieving efficient and accurate image inversion in text-to-image diffusion models, which is central to tasks like real-time image editing and rare concept generation. The experimental results across models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo, Flux) demonstrate GNRI\u2019s versatility, with the potential for broad impact in real-time generative model applications."

This typo gives the impression that the method still relies on the DDIM-inversion approximation. Please clarify these notations."

                "value": "The objective function $F(Z_t)$ in Eq. 9, which combines the residual term $r(z_t)$ and the regularization $G(z_t)$ raises questions about its role in achieving exact root-finding. The two terms in Eq. 9 seem to contradict each other, because a solution to $r(z_t) = 0$ will yield a $G(z_t) > 0$, which further leads to $F(z_t) > 0$ if $r(z_t) = 0$. This suggests that the method solves an approximation of the original inversion problem rather than the exact roots.\n\nIn Fig. 3(a), it is observed that GNRI achieves a lower residual than the non-guided NR inversion (NRI), which is unexpected since NRI has only one objective $r(z_t) = 0$. Why does GNRI, despite its additional regularization term, achieve a better residual than NRI? What is the residual level if you set $z_t = mu_t (G(z_t) = 0)$?"

Because a straightforward application of the NR method is infeasible for high-dimensional points, this paper reduces dimensionality by applying the L1\u200b-norm to the fixed-point function, transforming the Jacobian into a vector. Additionally, to prevent convergence to an off-manifold fixed point, a proximal term is added to the fixed-point function, steering the solution $z_t$ toward the mean of the forward distribution $q_t(z_t|z_{t-1})$ This complete framework is termed Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion (GNRI)."

                "value": "1. **Questionable Contribution**: Although the idea of employing NR seems innovative, the contribution in Sec 4.1 about applying the norm seems standard and not very innovative. Optimizing norms is a common practice in optimization. For example, on page 9 of ReNoise, the convergence analysis is performed using the l2-norm, and ExactDPM also applies gradient descent to the l2-norm. Actually, anyone who tries to apply Newton method would do the same thing naturally, because calculating Jacobian is impossible while calculating the gradient of the *norm* is very easy in PyTorch. Therefore, this point does not stand out.\n\n2. **Similarity to Other Methods**: The guiding regularizer introduced in Sec 4.2 appears similar to Pan et al.'s Anderson acceleration, which also aims to prevent large changes from previous estimates. This similarity raises questions about the originality of the approach. On the contrary, the significant drop in performance when $\\lambda=0$ in Figure C2 can be seen as an indication of the instability of NRI.\n\n3. **Memory Usage**: The Newton-Raphson method needs gradients, which can lead to high memory use. (It must be using torch.grad, I guess.) Other methods, like AIDI and the forward step method in ExactDPM, do not rely on gradients and may be more efficient, in terms of memory usage. ExactDPM actually used a smaller GPU than A100.\n\n4. **Some writings are confusing**: The description of $\\mathcal{F}$ is confusing because it is defined in two different ways: as a function from $\\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}^D$ in L203 and again as a function from $\\mathbb{R}^D \\to \\mathbb{R}^+$ in Eq (9). This inconsistency can mislead readers. Also, in line 577, the citation for Hong et al. is duplicated. In line 637, it should be noted that EDICT was presented at CVPR *2023*, not 2022.\n\n5. **Lack of Results for Rare Concept Generation**: The paper does not provide strong quantitative results for generating rare concepts. For example, Table 3 does not show significant improvements over existing methods."
