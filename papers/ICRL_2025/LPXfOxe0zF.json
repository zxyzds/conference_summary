    "abstract": "We propose BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly blockchain transaction detection. \nUnlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. \nFirst, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. \nWe design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. \nSecond, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences.\nAfter training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. \nExtensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. \nRemarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores.\nThis work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.",

                "value": "The paper proposes BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly transaction detections in Blockchain. Traditional rule-based approaches and techniques relying on off-the-shelf language models struggle with generalizability and scalability. In order to address previous limitations, BlockFound leverages a multi-modal tokenizer to handle the transaction features along with a Bert-based architecture using mask language modeling (MLM) to reduce computational demands. The experiment results demonstrate BlockFound outperforms the baseline models by achieving higher accuracy with lower false positive rates."

                "value": "I appreciate authors\u2019 efforts in identifying anomaly transactions in Blockchain via machine learning-based techniques. The methodology is clear and the model design is persuasive in general, but I still have several concerns on the transaction data used in this manuscript along with questions for authors to respond.\n\n## Q1: The definition of anomaly transactions is ambagious.\nSince the blockchain transactions can vary wildly in structure and content, it would be helpful to have a clear definition of the anomaly transactions. From my understanding, there could be various kinds of transactions regarded as anomaly. For example, the transactions emitted by malicious users to trigger smart contract vulnerabilities either on the implementation level (e.g., integer overflow and reentrancy) or logic level (e.g., inappropriate access control to methods) can be one kind of anomaly transactions. The fraud/phishing transactions belong to another kind. Could the authors supplement a clear definition of the anomaly transactions studied in this paper?\n\n## Q2: The size of malicious transaction data is limited.\n\nI noticed that only 28 malicious transactions in total were used in the training/testing dataset, which is quite limited. I am concerned about if the model can effectively learn the features of anomaly transactions from such a small dataset. Could the authors justify how the proposed model can reliably learn and differentiate the benign and malicious transactions based on the imbalanced dataset?\n\n## Q3: Potential redundancy in transaction data.\n\nContract templates are wildly used in real-world smart contract development, leading to different smart contracts may offering similar or even identical APIs to the users. This could cause potential duplication in the transaction data. I have two related questions for the authors:\n\n- Q3.1: For the transactions calling to the same methods with different argument values, do they contribute the equally to model training, i.e., can they be considered as duplicate?\n\n- Q3.2: If the above transactions are indeed duplicate, is it possible that similar redundant transactions are present in the dataset used for this study?"

                "value": "1. The introduction of this paper needs to sufficiently explain the motivation behind utilizing an LLM for detecting anomalous transactions in blockchain environments. It lacks evidence to support the claim that blockchain attacks are mainly due to anomalous transactions. Indeed, existing works have discussed that vulnerabilities in consensus protocols can lead to attacks authors mentioned, including double-spending attacks, even when transactions are valid and normal. From another perspective, even if anomalous transactions are detected, the paper does not provide evidence demonstrating that such detection can effectively prevent attacks. Additional references or evidence should be provided to justify the need for anomaly detection in blockchain transactions.\n2. The paper needs to clearly define what is an anomalous transaction. The ground truth for such anomalies is not clear. Only with a known ground truth of anomalous transactions can we discuss whether \"using the reconstruction errors as the metric for anomaly detection\" is appropriate.\n3. There is a need for more detailed analysis on the reliability of the datasets used (types, the number of training samples, the number of testing samples, etc.). For example, the statement \"our Ethereum dataset consists of 3,383 benign transactions for training, 709 benign transactions for testing, and 10 malicious transactions. The data was collected from October 2020 to April 2023.\" raises questions. Does this imply there were only ten malicious transactions on Ethereum from October 2020 to April 2023, or were these ten selected by the authors? If selected, what were the criteria for their selection?\n4. Why did the study use two different model architectures for different datasets? Does this indicate that the learning models for malicious transaction patterns lack transferability, necessitating the independent training of a model for each specific blockchain/dataset?\n5. While the paper is clear and logically presented, it is more like a technical report than an academic paper."
