    "title": "Phase-Aware KANGaussian : Phase-Regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network",
    "abstract": "Vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with modelling high frequency details, especially in unbounded scenes. Recent works such as Scaffold-GS and Spec-Gaussian have made tremendous improvements to the reconstruction quality of these high frequency details, specifically in synthetic and bounded scenes, but still struggle with unbounded real world scenes. Therefore, we propose Phase-Aware KANGaussian, a model building on these earlier contributions to produce state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for unbounded real world scenes with greatly improved high frequency details. Phase-Aware KANGaussian introduces a novel phase regularization method that optimizes models from low-to-high frequency, dramatically improving the quality of high frequency details. Phase-Aware KANGaussian is also one of the first few papers to integrate a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline to verify its performance against the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). All in all, Phase-Aware KANGaussian has three main contributions: (1) Introduce a Gaussian Splatting model with state-of-the-art performance in modelling real-world unbounded scenes with high frequency details, (2) a novel phase regularization technique to encode spatial representation and lastly, (3) first few to introduce a KAN into the Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline.",

                "value": "## Major Concerns:\n1. The novelty of phase regularization is questionable. FreGS [R1] has already provided frequency regularization on both amplitudes and phase parts. Equation 7 in this paper is similar to Equation 6 in FreGS. Besides, this paper introduces frequency filtering by expanding the frequency band, which is similar to the frequency annealing proposed in FreGS. For example, Equation 17 in this paper is similar to Equation 13 in FreGS. Please clarify the difference from FreGS, particularly for the above two aspects. Also, a comprehensive experimental comparison to validate the superior advantage of the proposed method is necessary.\n\n[R1] Zhang, Jiahui, et al. \"Fregs: 3d gaussian splatting with progressive frequency regularization.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.\n\n2. The lack of evaluation on synthetic datasets. Through the authors' claim of their SOTA performance on real unbounded scenes, they should also validate the proposed method on synthetic shiny scenes as used in Spec-Gaussian [R2] and [R3].\n\n[R2] Yang, Ziyi, et al. \"Spec-gaussian: Anisotropic view-dependent appearance for 3d gaussian splatting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.15870 (2024).\n[R3] Ye, Keyang, Qiming Hou, and Kun Zhou. \"3d gaussian splatting with deferred reflection.\" ACM SIGGRAPH 2024 Conference Papers. 2024.\n\n3. The experimental results presented in Table 1 for comparisons with Scaffold-GS [R4] raise some concerns. Specifically, the performance of Scaffold-GS on Mip-NeRF 360 is notably lower than the values reported in the original paper, whereas results on the other two datasets are the same. The authors do not clarify whether these results are based on retrained models or reporting values from the original work. Thus, the validity of the conclusions drawn from these comparisons is unclear. Please provide a more detailed description of the experimental setup and an explanation for the observed discrepancies in these results.\n\n[R4] Lu, Tao, et al. \u201cScaffold-GS: Structured 3d gaussians for view-adaptive rendering.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.\n\n4. The presented experimental results are not fully convincing. For instance, in the overall comparison of real datasets (Table 1), the proposed method ranks second in PSNR, underperforming compared to Spec-Gaussian [R2]. Additionally, in the ablation studies, the \u201cNo KAN\u201d variant surprisingly outperforms the proposed method on Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks&Temples in SSIM and LPIPS. Given SSIM and LPIPS\u2019 importance in assessing texture detail, more thorough explanations and additional experiments are needed to validate the effectiveness of each module.\n\n5. A direct comparison between the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and the MLP used in Spec-Gaussian [R2] is missing. Since the experimental results do not consistently surpass Spec-Gaussian on PSNR (Table 1), further evidence is needed to substantiate the choice of KAN over MLP.\n   \n6. The hyperparameters are not provided, e.g., the scalar terms of production of scale and phase regularization (Equation 19) used in experiments. Besides, an analysis or explanation of hyperparameter choice is better to be provided.\n\n7. Certain aspects of the writing lack clarity and structural coherence, hindering readability and comprehension of the paper\u2019s innovations. Here are some examples:\n* Lines 253-254: Potential confusion between \u201cspherical Gaussians\u201d and \u201cspherical harmonics.\u201d\n* Lines 259-260: Grammar issues in explaining the smooth and exponential terms.\n* Line 402: Mislabeling \u201c\\lambda_{prod}\u201d as \u201c\\lambda_{}\u201d.\n\n\n## Suggestions\n1. A visualization of the ablation studies would offer clearer insights into the contributions of each component.\n   \n2. A more detailed comparison of KAN and MLP is recommended, in addition to the accuracy, evaluations of time efficiency and resource consumption are also required.\n\n\nIn summary, while this paper incorporates KAN into the 3DGS framework, the highlighted weaknesses, such as less novelty, lack of comparison on shiny datasets, unclear comparisons, suboptimal experimental results, insufficient justification of KAN, and limited validation, need to be addressed."

The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making complex concepts accessible to readers. The authors provide comprehensive ablation studies and figure illustrations that thoroughly support their claims, showcasing the superiority of KANGaussian over traditional methods in real-world scenarios. The method's potential to handle high-frequency details and improve visual fidelity is well-articulated, backed by detailed experimental results that highlight its practical applicability and robustness."

As mentioned in the summary, I find the direct combination of KAN and GS in the well-explored area of neural GS appearance to be somewhat trivial. However, I believe that experimenting with novel technique combinations and sharing results benefits the community. I encourage such efforts, especially when the technique is straightforward. The results, though, are not significantly superior to other methods."

Section 3.2.3, on the other hand, is based on Fre-GS. The paper seems to be a KAN version that combines Spec-Gaussian with Fre-GS. I recommend that the authors move parts of these sections to the Preliminary section.\n2. The authors dedicated a significant portion of the paper to explaining how KANGaussian theoretically offers a higher capacity for modeling high-frequency information. However, in the Experiments section, there are no examples that demonstrate improvements in modeling specular components; instead, the focus is on floater removal, as seen in Figure 7. It could be much better if the authors used scenes with specular highlights, such as the example shown in Figure 5, to substantiate their claims and prove the effectiveness of their method in improving specular modeling.\n3. Missing comparison of training time and rendering efficiency (FPS). There is still a computational speed difference between KAN and MLP. Although KANGaussian may not have an advantage in rendering speed, it could be much better to provide these details to give readers a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the KAN-based approach. \n4. Missing comparison of the number of Gaussians. The quantity of Gaussians has a significant impact on rendering metrics, and the authors need to provide a comparison of the actual number of Gaussians used in each method to ensure a fair comparison."
