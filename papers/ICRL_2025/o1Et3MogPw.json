    "title": "Internet of Agents: Weaving a Web of Heterogeneous Agents for Collaborative Intelligence",
    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities. We will release our code to facilitate further research.",

                "value": "This paper proposes the \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA) framework to facilitate enhanced collaboration among autonomous agents using large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the Internet\u2019s structure, IoA aims to address the integration challenges seen in current multi-agent systems (MAS). This is achieved through three key innovations: a protocol for integrating diverse agents, a layered architecture resembling an instant-messaging framework, and mechanisms for dynamic team formation and conversation flow. Through a series of experiments, the paper claims that IoA enables more effective collaboration than existing MAS frameworks, particularly in domains like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and embodied AI tasks."

It is not unclear why GAIA benchmarks would need agents over internet instead of a simple central multi-agent system.\n\n- Scalability and Performance Analysis: The paper lacks analysis on IoA\u2019s computational overhead and network latency issues, especially when scaled to large numbers of agents across different devices distributed settings. An understanding of these scalability and performance trade-offs is critical.\n\n- Vagueness in Mechanisms for Conversation Flow Control: The conversation flow control relies on LLMs and a finite state machine (FSM) for transitions, but the scalability of this approach when coordinating many situations with many states is not well justified. It would be great to have some ablation studies.\n\n- Limited Insight into Integration of Third-Party Agents: The implementation of heterogeneous agent integration is described conceptually, but details on handling diverse architectures and security considerations when integrating third-party agents are lacking.\n\n- Limited Novel Research Contributions: The paper\u2019s focus on architecture and engineering limits its contribution to ML research. While the framework offers novel infrastructure, the lack of new research methodologies or performance optimizations in agent interactions might reduce its appeal in ML-centric venues."

The framework aims to facilitate collaboration among autonomous agents by addressing the limitations of existing multi-agent frameworks, including ecosystem isolation, single-device simulation, and rigid communication and coordination. IoA consists of two core components: the server and the client. The server acts as a central hub controller, while the client serves as a wrapper for individual agents, enabling the necessary communications and protocols. The IoA architecture has three layers, i.e., interaction, data, and foundation layers, they collectively accelerate agent collaboration through the network. Experiments conducted in various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of IoA in facilitating efficient collaboration among heterogeneous agents."
