    "title": "ParetoFlow: Guided Flows in Multi-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "In offline multi-objective optimization (MOO), we leverage an offline dataset of designs and their associated labels to simultaneously minimize multiple objectives. This setting more closely mirrors complex real-world problems compared to single-objective optimization. Recent works mainly employ evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization, with limited attention given to the generative modeling capabilities inherent in such data. In this study, we explore generative modeling in offline MOO through flow matching, noted for its effectiveness and efficiency. We introduce a \\textit{ParetoFlow} method, specifically designed to guide flow sampling to approximate the Pareto front. Traditional predictor~(classifier) guidance is inadequate for this purpose because it models only a single objective. In response, we propose a \\textit{multi-objective predictor guidance} module that \nassigns each sample a weight vector, representing a weighted distribution across multiple objective predictions. A local filtering scheme is introduced to address non-convex Pareto fronts. These weights uniformly cover the entire objective space, effectively directing sample generation towards the Pareto front. Since distributions with similar weights tend to generate similar samples, we introduce a \\textit{neighboring evolution} module to foster knowledge sharing among neighboring distributions. This module generates offspring from these distributions, and selects the most promising one for the next iteration. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Our code is available.",

                "value": "This paper presents *ParetoFlow*, an innovative approach aimed at offline multi-objective optimization (MOO) that leverages the flow-matching generative modeling framework. The authors introduce two key modules: a *multi-objective predictor guidance module* that uses uniform weight vectors to direct sample generation toward approximating the Pareto front and a *neighboring evolution module* for sharing knowledge between distributions with similar objectives. These techniques are designed to improve coverage of both convex and non-convex Pareto fronts and enhance sample diversity."

This method captures the potential of generative models for addressing complex, multi-faceted optimization challenges.\n\n- The proposed module that fosters information exchange among adjacent distributions is a standout feature. This knowledge-sharing mechanism supports enhanced exploration and refinement of solutions.\n\n- This method was evaluated across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing MOO methods such as PROUD, LaMBO-2, and CorrVAE, especially in generating high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.\n\n- The provided code and training details are clear."

A broader comparison that includes more traditional, non-generative MOO techniques could strengthen the context of ParetoFlow's advantages and limitations.\n\n[1] Yaron Lipman, Ricky TQ Chen, Heli Ben-Hamu, Maximilian Nickel, and Matt Le.

Incorporating more detailed mathematical formulations, proofs, and theoretical underpinnings would strengthen the credibility and scholarly value of the work.\n\n2. **Incorrect Formalization in Line 105**: The statement on line 105 is inaccurate. A Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem cannot be \"formally\" formulated merely as a vector optimization problem. Such a formulation is more of an informal notational convenience rather than a formal definition. Clarification and correct formalism are needed here.\n\n3. **Unclear Purpose of Equation (9)**: The role and application of Equation (9) are not clearly explained. It is difficult to understand its significance and how it fits into the overall argument of the paper. Providing a thorough explanation or context for this equation would enhance comprehension.\n\n4. **Unconvincing Integration of EA and Flow Matching**: The combination of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) and flow matching presented in the paper does not seem convincing. Additional justification, evidence, or examples demonstrating the effectiveness of this integration would help in substantiating this approach.\n\n5. **Inappropriateness of Section 4.6 in Main Text**: Section 4.6 may not be suitable for inclusion in the main body of the paper. It might be more appropriate to place this section in an appendix or supplementary material to maintain the focus and flow of the main content.\n\n6. **Unconvincing Experimental Results Using Hypervolume Metric**: The experiments conducted are not entirely convincing, particularly due to the exclusive use of the hypervolume (HV) metric. If alternative methods such as SMS-MOEA were employed, it is questionable whether the proposed method would perform as well as, or better than, SMS-MOEA. Including comparisons with such methods and using a variety of performance metrics could provide a more comprehensive evaluation."
