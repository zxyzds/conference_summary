    "title": "Test-Time Training for Out-of-Distribution Industrial Anomaly Detection via Robust Distribution Alignment",
    "abstract": "Detecting anomalous patterns is essential for quality control in industrial applications, with state-of-the-art methods relying on large defect-free datasets to model normal distributions. However, robustness under domain shift, such as changes in lighting or sensor drift, remains a critical challenge in real-world deployment. An existing work, Generalized Normality Learning (GNL), addresses domain shifts by enforcing feature consistency through training-time augmentation, but its reliance on prior knowledge of target distributions and access to training data at inference limits flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose a memory bank-based anomaly detection method that avoids retraining or access to training data during inference. We improve the robustness to distribution shifts via distribution alignment based test-time training. Our approach leverages a modified Sinkhorn distance to align distributions and handle outliers, offering a more resilient solution for industrial anomaly detection under realistic constraints. Extensive evaluations on out-of-distribution anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness.",

Therefore, a more reasonable way to employ TTT should be in few-shot IAD, where the normal memory is easily overfitted and need to be refined. The most recently corresponding works are depicted in [1].\n2. There lacks theoretical analysis on convergence of the proposed rectified Sinkhorn algorithm.\n3. There lacks comparisons on real-time efficiency between the proposed method and other competitors, which should be crucial for practical use.\n\n[1] FOCT: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection with foreground-aware online conditional transport."

                "value": "Lack of Importance and Novelty: The problem that the paper aims to solve does not seem particularly novel or significant. The paper attempts to address two issues faced by GNL. First, requiring prior knowledge of the target data distribution during training may not be practical. GNL's performance can degrade significantly when the distribution shift at test time is different from the augmentations used during training. Second, accessing normal training samples during inference may be restricted due to privacy concerns or data storage limitations. However, both of these problems have already been extensively researched and addressed by prior works. For instance, the first problem has been well-studied, and methods such as Invariant Risk Minimization can be used to tackle it.\n\nInsufficient Explanation of the Proposed Method's Effectiveness: The paper does not clearly articulate why the proposed method is effective in solving the identified issues. On line 76, the authors state that a memory bank is introduced to solve these problems. However, they do not adequately explain why the memory bank specifically helps address the challenge of distribution shifts during test time.\n\nPoor Writing Quality and Logical Gaps: There are numerous flaws in the logical flow of the paper, making it difficult to understand. Here are some specific examples:\n\na. On line 82, the authors mention referring to Fig. 2 to observe performance decline, but this is not clearly visible from the figure.\n\nb. On line 84, test-time adaptation is introduced without sufficient motivation, making the reasoning difficult to follow.\n\nc. On line 92, the authors argue that mixture Gaussian KL-Divergence lacks a closed-form solution and thus cannot be used. However, mixture Gaussian models are widely applied, and with appropriate adjustments, this issue could be addressed.\n\nd. On line 94, it is unclear why test-time training is considered an optimal transport problem.\n\nAs illustrated above, the paper contains many subjective viewpoints without concrete explanations. The issues listed here represent only part of the logical gaps in the paper. I believe the authors need to further refine and revise their work.\n\nUnclear and Potentially Erroneous Mathematical Formulation: The mathematical formulations in the paper are not clearly presented, and some even appear to contain errors, further hindering comprehension.\n\na. On line 172, the authors refer to a backbone network as $z_i$, but $z_i$ clearly cannot represent the backbone network.\n\nb. On line 173, $C(\\cdot, K)$ is introduced, but neither $C$ nor $K$ is defined.\n\nc. In Equation 1, the authors denote $M \\in D_s$, but there is no apparent set relationship between $M$ and $D_s$. Similarly, there is no clear set relationship between $z_j$ and $D_s$.\n\nSuch errors are not uncommon in the paper, making it increasingly difficult to follow.\n\nAn Unnatural Combination of Techniques: The proposed approach appears to be a somewhat forced combination of two existing techniques aimed at solving the Industrial Anomaly Detection problem, lacking originality."
