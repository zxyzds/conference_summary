    "abstract": "In this paper, we use the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) combined with the {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont \\textit{supercomputer}} support to create a \\textbf{C}ombustion \\textbf{K}inetics (CK) dataset for machine learning and scientific research. This dataset captures the development of fires in industrial parks with high-precision Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. It includes various physical fields such as temperature and pressure, and covers multiple environmental combinations for exploring \\underline{multi-physics} field coupling phenomena. Additionally, we evaluate several advanced machine learning architectures across our {\\fontfamily{lmtt}\\selectfont {Open-CK}} benchmark using a substantial computational setup of 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs: \\ding{182} vision backbone; \\ding{183} spatio-temporal predictive models; \\ding{184} operator learning frameworks. These architectures uniquely excel at handling complex physical field data. We also introduce three benchmarks to demonstrate their potential in enhancing the exploration of downstream tasks: (a) capturing continuous changes in combustion kinetics; (b) a neural partial differential equation solver for learning temperature fields and turbulence; (c) reconstruction of sparse physical observations. The Open-CK dataset and benchmarks aim to advance research in combustion kinetics driven by machine learning, providing a reliable baseline for developing and comparing cutting-edge technologies and models. We hope to further promote the application of deep learning in earth sciences. Our project is available at \\url{https://github.com/whscience/Open-CK}.",

For example, Sandia's Engine Combustion Network by Pickett,Payri et al has been providing open data and benchamrking with regards to gasoline and diesel CFD since about 9 years ago. Another similar effort to this is BLASTNet in Chung et al (NeurIPS 2023) which involved Direct Numerical Simulation data of canonical combustion configurations.  Please revise this statement to be more moderate.\n2. \"Open-CK involves several PDEs\" -- All listed PDE's are actually just scalar/vector conservation equations. Is this statement really true?\n\n3. It would be interesting to see if the effects of model scaling has metrics in table 2. Bigger,expensive models tend to outperform smaller models. What does MSE vs FLOPS or MSE vs Params, SSIM vs (FLOPs, Params) look like in a scatter plot? This can provide more insight into useful architectures."

So, are there just 300 time series samples of different lengths across various combustion parameters and environmental conditions?\n\n2. If I understand correctly, the paper considers only one geometrical layout for the data set. While the setup represents a typical industrial park scenario, the data set may not be rich enough for generalizable SciML research without having diverse geometrical layouts."
