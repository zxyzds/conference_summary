    "abstract": "Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are used to model sequences of different types of events with irregular arrival times, with broad applications ranging from healthcare and social networks to finance. We address shortcomings in existing point process models by drawing connections between modern deep state-space models (SSMs) and linear Hawkes processes (LHPs), culminating in an MTPP we call the _deep linear Hawkes process_ (DLHP). The DLHP modifies the linear differential equations in deep SSMs to be stochastic jump differential equations, akin to LHPs. After discretizing, the resulting recurrence can be implemented efficiently using a parallel scan. This brings both linear scaling and parallelism to MTPP models. This contrasts with attention-based MTPPs, which scale quadratically, and RNN-based MTPPs, which do not parallelize across the sequence length. We show empirically that DLHPs match or outperform existing models across a broad range of metrics on eight real-world datasets. Our proposed DLHP model is the first instance of the unique architectural capabilities of SSMs being leveraged to construct a new class of MTPP models.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a new marked temporal point process (MTPP) model known as the deep linear Hawkes process (DLHP), which is developed by integrating deep state-space models (SSMs) and linear Hawkes processes (LHPs). Through the use of diagonalization and discretization techniques, the DLHP enables efficient implementation of closed-form update. The model has been shown to surpass current methods in terms of performance on a variety of benchmark tasks, excelling in metrics such as log-likelihood and runtime across different sequence lengths. A key contribution of the research is pioneering the use of SSMs' unique architecture to develop a new class of MTPP models, positioning the DLHP as a competitive model in applications."

Does the enhancement in performance contributes to this increased complexity (since increased model complexity may lead to higher model likelihood value)? It would be better to provide necessary analysis regarding this issue and add some experiments for illustration if possible.\n2. The proposed method sacrifices some of the interpretability of latent dynamics and parameters that are characteristic of LHPs, which could impact the model's transparency and understanding, and limit its usability for high-stakes applications where understanding event interactions is crucial. Would you discuss possible solutions or ideas regarding this issue? The motivation stated in line 201-214 of page 4 may provide some clues and could be discussed more deeply."

                "value": "Though I enjoyed reading the paper, there are still a few aspects of the paper that I think can be improved or answered by the authors:\n\n*Methodology*:\n\n1. I am not very convinced about the use of the Hawkes-process-like mechanism in each layer. I understand the connection between a linear Hawkes process and the SSM via the stochastic differential equation, but what is the need/meaning/interpretation of using this connection in the model? Why use $AB$ instead of one matrix of size $P\\times H$ (or use $E\\alpha$ instead of one $P*K$ matrix) as the parameters in Equation 10? If the idea is to inherit or imitate the parameter structure in the linear Hawkes process, this structure of parameters is overwritten/ignored since there are multiple layers and non-linear transformations stacked together.\n\n2. On the other hand, if the authors do want to imitate the parameter structure of the linear Hawkes process, then the diagonalization would assume no influence between different marks, which is unrealistic in practice. And there is also no interpretation of the learned $\\Lambda$ and $\\alpha$ in the experiments.\n\n*Experiments*:\n\n3. I would suggest that the authors conduct more synthetic data experiments and results to validate the model\u2019s ability to recover the ground truth. Only one simple Poisson process example is not enough, and the real data experiments are not straightforward in terms of interpreting the model's effectiveness.\n\n4. No standard deviation was reported for the metrics in the tables/figures. The results of DLHP look like a random win against baselines given no reported standard deviation, especially only on real-world datasets with no ground truth.\n\n5. It would be better if there was a rigorous computational complexity analysis of the model and baselines since the authors claim that it is one of the main strengths of using SSMs in modeling marked TPPs."

Do the authors have any insights on how to choose the model architecture, given the performance discrepancy of the model using forward and backward mechanisms?\n\n3. What do the authors mean by 1.4 times improvement from baselines in line 92? If it refers to the average rank of the DLHP, does it mean a lower number is better?"
