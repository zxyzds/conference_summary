    "title": "Efficient Causal Decision Making with One-sided Feedback",
    "abstract": "We study a class of decision-making problems with one-sided feedback, where outcomes are only observable for specific actions. A typical example is bank loans, where the repayment status is known only if a loan is approved and remains undefined if rejected. In such scenarios, conventional approaches to causal decision evaluation and learning from observational data are not directly applicable. In this paper, we introduce a novel value function to evaluate decision rules that addresses the issue of undefined counterfactual outcomes. Without assuming no unmeasured confounders, we establish the identification of the value function using shadow variables. Furthermore, leveraging semiparametric theory, we derive the efficiency bound for the proposed value function and develop efficient methods for decision evaluation and learning. Numerical experiments and a real-world data application demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed methods.",

                "value": "This paper addresses decision-making with one-sided feedback, where outcomes are observable only for chosen actions, such as approved loans. The authors introduce a new value function for evaluating decisions without assuming the no unmeasured confounders (NUC) condition. Using shadow variables, they establish identifiability and derive the efficient influence function (EIF) and the semiparametric efficiency bound of the value function. Motivated by the EIF, they develop two efficient estimators for the value function, applicable to binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. They propose a weighted, classification-based framework to learn the optimal decision rule. Empirical results validate the method's effectiveness."

                "value": "The paper's main strength  is introducing a modified value function and establishing identifiability for this value function by leveraging so called shadow variables (SVs). The authors derive the efficient influence function (EIF) and the semiparametric efficiency bound of the value function. Additionally, in the case of continuous distributions, their proposed estimation strategy avoids estimating the density when the outcome is continuous, thus preventing instability. Furthermore, they demonstrate that their estimators are consistent and achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound under mild conditions for nuisance function approximation."

                "value": "The assumption of knowing the shadow variables (SVs) may restrict the practical application of the proposed approach. Similarly, assumption 4.2 could also limit the applicability of the proposed methods. Although the authors cite some relevant papers for assumption 4.2, more discussion is needed to clarify how restrictive this assumption is.  The proposed methodology requires that conditional expectations \\( P(Y | A = 1, X) \\) be consistently estimated. This might be an issue particularly for high-dimensional discrete covariates, i.e., categorical variables that can take on a large number of distinct categories or levels."

Can the authors explain how this assumption guarantees this? Also, is it a sufficient condition for uniqueness, or could there be necessary or more relaxed conditions?\n\n* Regarding assumption 4.2, it is worthwhile to discuss in the paper how restrictive this assumption is. Perhaps the authors could mention some cases where it does not hold.\n\n* How do high-dimensional categorical covariates affect the estimation for the conditional expectations as required by assumption 5.1?\n\n* The authors mentioned that the maximizer for the efficient estimator denoted by $ \\hat{\\pi} $ is a natural estimator for the true optimal decision rule $ \\pi^* $, which is a maximizer of the true value function. Although in experiments, the authors show percentages of making correct decisions (PCD), can they provide any discussion on how far $ \\hat{\\pi} $ can be from the true optimal rule $ \\pi^* $ in general?"

Therefore, the newly defined value function V1(\u03c0) quantifies the expected monetary outcome for the bank when implementing decision rule \u03c0 for loan approvals\"\n\nI want to argue that the bank in fact does lose money when it rejects a loan. Some of the loans, might have in fact not defaulted and therefore produced a profit for the bank. This concept is known to me as \"opportunity cost\", sometimes defined as \"the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen\".\n\nIn this case, it'd be the loss of the potential gain from giving out the loan, when choosing to reject the loan applicant.\n\nThere seems to be no discussion of whether this new definition of the value function makes conceptually sense. It is assumed to be valid, and technical challenges are solved (probably successfully)."

Why or why not?\n- Is there a practical background for this new value function? is it already being used in decision making elsewhere?\n- What was the inspiration for this value function? Is it simply the observation that we can't do anything otherwise or is there a more fundamental observation from e.g. banking where this function is being actively used?\n\nIf it's just a technical convenience, but no practical relevance, than the contribution of this paper is hard to justify without a stronger discussion of why a user should accept this value function.\n\nIf there is more to it than just a technical connivence, than I am very keen to learn about that!\n\nThanks!"
