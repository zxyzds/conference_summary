    "title": "How Discrete and Continuous Diffusion Meet: Comprehensive Analysis of Discrete Diffusion Models  via a Stochastic Integral Framework",
    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their ability to model complex distributions with tractable sampling and inference. However, the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of discrete diffusion models based on L\u00e9vy-type stochastic integrals. By generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to It\u00f4 integrals and Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and obtains the first error bound for the $\\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence. With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete diffusion model applications.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of error analysis in discrete diffusion\nmodels. To bridge the gap between discrete and continuous diffusion models\n(for which the error analysis is better understood), the authors propose a\nframework based on Levy-type stochastic integrals, by generalizing Poisson\nrandom measures to support state-dependent and time-varying intensities\nunder assumptions of regularity of rate matrix, and bounded and continuous\nscore function. This framework allows for error decomposition into\ncomponents such as truncation, approximation, and discretization errors,\nproviding clearer insight into error sources.  The analysis is performed\nfor tau-leaping and uniformization methods, two methods to simulate the\nbackward process. They establish stronger error bounds compared to previous\nwork using KL divergence."

This unified framework also compares $\\tau$-leaping and uniformization methods, highlighting computational efficiency and accuracy.
