    "title": "QuaDiM: A Conditional Diffusion Model For Quantum State Property Estimation",
    "abstract": "Quantum state property estimation (QPE) is a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body problems in physics and chemistry, involving the prediction of characteristics such as correlation and entanglement entropy through statistical analysis of quantum measurement data. Recent advances in deep learning have provided powerful solutions, predominantly using auto-regressive models. These models generally assume an intrinsic ordering among qubits, aiming to approximate the classical probability distribution through sequential training. However, unlike natural language, the entanglement structure of qubits lacks an inherent ordering, hurting the motivation of such models. In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-autoregressive generative model called \\textbf{QuaDiM}, designed for \\underline{\\textbf{Qua}}ntum state property estimation using \\underline{\\textbf{Di}}ffusion \\underline{\\textbf{M}}odels. QuaDiM progressively denoises Gaussian noise into the distribution corresponding to the quantum state, encouraging equal, unbiased treatment of all qubits. QuaDiM learns to map physical variables to properties of the ground state of the parameterized Hamiltonian during offline training. Afterwards one can sample from the learned distribution conditioned on previously unseen physical variables to collect measurement records and employ post-processing to predict properties of unknown quantum states. We evaluate QuaDiM on large-scale QPE tasks using classically simulated data on the 1D anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model with the system size up to 100 qubits. Numerical results demonstrate that \\model outperforms baseline models, particularly auto-regressive approaches, under conditions of limited measurement data during training and reduced sample complexity during inference.",

                "value": "* While the motivation for using non-autoregressive models is briefly discussed in the introduction, there could be more discussion and empirical evidence to support the claims about the sub-optimal performance of auto-regressive methods. While the measurements are not like language, the underlying physics model can still have some order structure (like a chain) and locality information is often important. Therefore, it's not completely obvious why diffusion models are necessarily better.\n* QuaDiM lacks machine learning technical novelty. The conditional diffusion model are already well studied in the literature and the used score neural network seems to be standard transformer as well. Given that ICLR is a ML conference, it would be more interesting to see applications and inspiration that can be drawn from QuaDiM to more general problems.\n* The experimental setup are not clearly presented. For example, the generation protocol of system parameter $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L - 1}$ is not described in the experiments section, not to mention the training and test set splitting process. This makes it hard to understand under what level QuaDiM extrapolates to \"unseen parameters\".\n* The experiment design is relatively weak. It would be interesting to consider more complicated property estimation problems, such as the estimation of entanglement negativity, two site observables with long ranges in between, or even the estimation of system parameters in the Hamiltonian. Second, it would be more convincing if QuaDiM is examined on a more complicated physics model, such as some with non-trivial long-range entanglement. It would be more convincing if the extrapolation of QuaDiM to critical state of the physics model could be tested and examined. \n* The benchmarks are not representative enough. For example, [1-3] are also works that model quantum states that should enable property estimation as downstream tasks, but are not discussed or compared.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Fitzek, David, et al. \"RydbergGPT.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.21052 (2024).\n\n[2] Du, Yuxuan, et al. \"Shadownet for data-centric quantum system learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.11290 (2023).\n\n[3] Zhang, Yuan-Hang, and Massimiliano Di Ventra. \"Transformer quantum state: A multipurpose model for quantum many-body problems.\" Physical Review B 107.7 (2023): 075147."

Can you elaborate more on this?\n* Why QuaDiM will generate measurements consistently sampled from a valid quantum state without violating structure constraints. How is this enforced in the learning algorithm?\n* Does QuaDiM extrapolate to unseen system parameter $x$ distribution, likely with disjoint support as the training distribution, e.g., trained on $x \\in [0, 0.8]$, tested on $x \\in [0.9, 1]$?\n* Can you comment on QuaDiM's training efficiency? First, it seems that a relatively large $M_{in}$ is required for learning one ground state to good accuracy, also $M_{out}$ is not a small number as well. Can $M_{in}$ and $M_{out}$ be improved? Second, how many distinct pairs of (ground state, measurements) are needed for learning the mapping between Hamiltonian parameter and system ground state correctly, and how does this scale with the number of qubits?"

Traditionally, auto-regressive models have been used for this task, modeling the quantum state array as a sequential structure despite the lack of inherent sequential ordering in quantum states. Unlike these approaches, QuaDiM denoises and shapes all states in the array simultaneously, as is typical in diffusion models, allowing it to effectively capture non-sequential interactions between spatially separated states. The proposed structure essentially includes an embedding that allows discrete quantum states to be treated as continuous diffusive evolution within a (conditional) diffusion model.

It effectively addresses an interesting topic in the field of quantum computing through appropriate structural selection; however, it is uncertain whether this topic is broadly interesting to the ICLR audience.\n\n- I am not fully convinced why a diffusion model is the most suitable choice for the (non-sequential) quantum property estimation task. To me, this task fundamentally seems to be manageable by other generative models, such as conditional VAEs, GANs, or energy models. The authors mention that these generative models can only handle a single specific quantum state and cannot generalize to unseen states, but I am curious why a diffusion model is capable of generalizing to unseen states. While it is true that diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in terms of both fidelity and diversity, achieving high performance for diffusion models generally requires a large amount of training data. Therefore, the authors would clarify why the proposed QuaDiM would be particularly beneficial for quantum state property estimation, compared to other generative models, in a practical setting (e.g., limited observation as the authors mentioned).\n\n- The authors claim that the primary motivation behind the proposed QuaDiM model is to eliminate the sequential handling of quantum states present in existing models. However, QuaDiM employs an embedding function to represent discrete quantum states as continuous variables, following the approach in [1], which uses token and positional embeddings commonly used in text generation. It seems that this embedding, originally designed for text generation, inherently carries a sequential bias, which makes the motivation and effectiveness of the proposed QuaDiM less convincing to me.\n\n- The authors should explicitly mention the number of parameters and training time of the models used to ensure a fair comparison. Although this is not a critical issue, the network architecture and number of parameters of the main competitor, LLM4QPE, and the proposed QuaDiM appear to be nearly identical.\n\n- Some minor issues: In Table 2, for L = 70, M = 100 and QuaDiM (ours), is the result 0.0597 correct?
