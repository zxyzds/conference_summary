    "title": "INFER: A Neural-symbolic Model For Extrapolation Reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graph",
    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph(TKG) serves as an efficacious way to store dynamic facts in real-world. Extrapolation reasoning on TKGs, which aims at predicting possible future events, has attracted consistent research interest. Recently, some rule-based methods have been proposed, which are considered more interpretable compared with embedding-based methods. Existing rule-based methods apply rules through path matching or subgraph extraction, which falls short in inference ability and suffers from missing facts in TKGs. Besides, during rule application period, these methods consider the standing of facts as a binary 0 or 1 problem and ignores the validity as well as frequency of historical facts under temporal settings.\nIn this paper, by designing a novel paradigm for rule application, we propose INFER, a neural-symbolic model for TKG extrapolation. With the introduction of Temporal Validity Function, INFER firstly considers the frequency and validity of historical facts and extends the truth value of facts into continuous real number to better adapt for temporal settings. INFER builds Temporal Weight Matrices with a pre-trained static KG embedding model to enhance its inference ability. Moreover INFER adopts a rule projection module which enables it apply rules through conducting matrices operation on GPU, which improves the efficiency of rule application. This feature also facilitates potential integration with existing embedding-based methods.\nExperimental results show that INFER achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets and significantly outperforms existing rule-based models on our modified, more sparse TKG datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of our model in inference ability.",
