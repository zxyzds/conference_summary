    "title": "Design of Ligand-Binding Proteins with Atomic Flow Matching",
    "abstract": "Designing novel proteins that bind to small molecules is a long-standing challenge in computational biology, with applications in developing catalysts, biosensors, and more. Current computational methods rely on the assumption that the binding pose of the target molecule is known, which is not always feasible, as conformations of novel targets are often unknown and tend to change upon binding. In this work, we formulate proteins and molecules as unified biotokens, and present AtomFlow, a novel deep generative model under the flow-matching framework for the design of ligand-binding proteins from the 2D target molecular graph alone. Operating on representative atoms of biotokens, AtomFlow captures the flexibility of ligands and generates ligand conformations and protein backbone structures iteratively. We consider the multi-scale nature of biotokens and demonstrate that AtomFlow can be effectively trained on a subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank, by matching flow vector field using an SE(3) equivariant structure prediction network. Experimental results show that our method can generate high-fidelity ligand-binding proteins and achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model RFDiffusionAA, while not requiring bound ligand structures. As a general framework, AtomFlow holds the potential to be applied to various biomolecule generation tasks in the future.",

                "value": "W.1 I think the major weakness lies in its novelty. First of all, using Flow-matching with full atom generation in peptide [1] or protein [2] other bio-molecules is not a new idea. Besides, the equivariant generation process [3,4,5] and FAPE loss in AlphaFold still follow previous works. Therefore,this work appears to be a fusion of several previous studies, applied in a new task, lacking innovation in terms of the methodology. I hope the author could clarify the difference between the techniques used in this paper and the origianl ones, and the  improvements upon previous approaches. This would give the authors an opportunity to highlight any methodological innovations that may not be immediately apparent. Therefore, I have doubts about whether the level of novelty in this paper meets the standards expected for a top-tier conference like ICLR.\n\nW.2 In the experiment, RFDiffusion based method like RFDiffusionAA is compared, but there should be more works which can fulfill such tasks, such as [6] and [7]. I am wondering that can such baselines be all included into experimental comparison? I hope the author  could discuss any technical or practical limitations that may have prevented including other baselines. Besides, I think AlphaFold3 can also fulfill this task, so what is the advantage of yours over AlphaFold3? Or there are several distinct differences between AtomFlow and AlphaFold3 in design protein binder with molecule targets? I hope the authors can clarify if AlphaFold3 is directly applicable to this specific task of designing ligand-binding proteins from 2D molecular graphs, and if so, I hope the authors to explain the key differences or advantages of their approach compared to AlphaFold3 for this particular application.\n\n[1] Kong, Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion, https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13555\n\n[2] Avishek Joey Bose, SE(3)-Stochastic Flow Matching for Protein Backbone Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02391\n\n[3] Xu, GeoDiff: a Geometric Diffusion Model for Molecular Conformation Generation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02923\n\n[4] Emiel, Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D, https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17003\n\n[5] Lin, PPFlow: Target-aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching, https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06642\n\n[6] Zhang, Pocketgen: Generating Full-Atom Ligand-Binding Protein Pockets. bioRxiv, 2024.\n\n[7] Hannes Stark, Bowen Jing, Regina Barzilay, and Tommi Jaakkola.

Please remove the infinite loop and the check for the clash score, it takes too much time. \n\nWe have executed it on a couple of example, including recent L targets from CASP. I have carefully examined the generated output for L1000 ligand set. With a significant probability (about 30%), AtomFlow finds the native experimental fold (we have ~20 PDB structures with ligands different from those in CASP) and the binding site, and is also rather stable with variations of the sequence length. If I vary the design length slightly, AtomFlow seems to prefer to shorten loops even those inside the binding site, so it seems it has memorized the space of all protein folds in the PDB and simply selects the one it has seen during training. It actually can be a useful tool for fold search and classification.\n\nIndividual protein-ligand contacts vary in quality significantly. So I have doubts in any usefulness of further affinity prediction providing a very low quality of experimental affinity data (see below).\n\nWe have also tried to generate folds for a purine ligand, which is a part of nucleotide bases (expecting many different folds to be generated). Surprisingly, at a constant generation length, the results were extremely conservative, with zero novelty and extremely low diversity, preferring the fold that dominantly occurs in the PDB. So, I suggest the authors to run more cross-validation tests hiding some fold classes from the training and trying to reproduce them in the test. Otherwise it seems there is a significant bias towards the folds that are abandon in the PDB."

                "value": "There is little technical novelty in the architecture blocks, loss function of flow matching process (but the architecture is novel and useful).\n\nSince you are using the FAPE loss, why do you need equations 3-5, references to Riemannian Flow Matching, and fancy words? It will be much cleaner to remove this part. \n\nBinding affinity experiments are far from complete and better to be removed. You need to split the data correctly and run multiple affinity benchmarks, for example, following CASF and DUDe protocols. It will also be useful to provide energies and folds for some well-studied proteins that have multiple structures with different ligands (they are currently coming in the PDB, you may look at the last CASP experiment). Please also provide Vina scores for native ligand poses. Vina is not the best proxy for the affinity, as it was design only to rank binding poses for the same protein-ligand complex.\n\nPlease also be aware of the quality of current affinity training sets -- e.g., https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00049.\n\n\"The scatter plot of scRMSD vs. pdbTM shown in Figure 6B reveals that ATOMFLOW has the ability to generate structures that are quite different from existing proteins with acceptable designability\" - Well, all of your designs have scores > 0.5, a few are around 0.5. It means that the fold structure is the same as in the PDB, no new folds have been discovered. Please try to discover a fold with a TM score around 0.2."

It contradicts all the theory you have just presented, no?\n\nCan you comment on proper cross-validation experiments by removing certain fold classes from training? The same is valid for affinity experiments. Please also consider novel data with one protein and multiple ligands as validation, see four datasets from CASP16, for example."

The architecture is based on AlphaFold and predicts denoised structures from a distance map input of the input structure. The method is evaluated on (1) the set of 4 ligands studied in RFDiff-AA, and (2) an expanded set of ligands curated by the authors. AtomFlow is shown to have comparable or better designability than RFAA as well as similar Vina score."

Further, the flow model architecture and noising process are based on AlphaFlow, with different justification but no difference in practice as far as I can tell. To improve on this axis, while it's not clear that more methodological novelty is needed for its own sake, the authors could focus on novel evaluations or applications of the proposed method.\n\n**Quality**\n* The computational evaluations are well executed, but limited in scope. Most of the analysis focuses on only 4 ligands, raising concerns about sample size and statistical significance. \n* The diversity and novelty evaluations are nice, but only AtomFlow is evaluated, not RFDiff-AA or the other baselines.\n\n\n**Significance**\n* The overall significance of the contribution is unclear as it represents an incremental methodological advance over RFDiff-AA with more or less the same model capabilities. The authors argue that not needing to specify the ligand pose is a big plus, but no meaningful evidence or use case is provided for this distinction. After all, RFDiff-AA has been experimentally validated, whereas AtomFlow-generated poses have not. It is of course not expected for a ML submission to experimentally validate the proteins, but it should be made a bit clearer why the main point of difference with RFDiff-AA is important to tackle as a ML problem."

Further details on the full training process would be beneficial.\n- The paper indicates that, during training, the FAPE loss is divided into protein-protein interaction, protein-ligand interaction, and ligand-ligand interaction components. However, these three losses are not directly introduced or explained in detail. Could the authors elaborate on the definitions of these three loss components and how they are calculated?\n- The paper appears to lack ablation studies that could support certain design choices in the model. For instance, what impact would removing the first phase of training (the 40k steps on protein structure generation only) have on model performance? Additionally, how were the initial training and fine-tuning parameters in the second training phase determined, and what criteria guided the transition steps?"
