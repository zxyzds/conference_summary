    "title": "FAST: Federated Average with Snapshot Unleashes Arbitrary Client Participation",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) provides a flexible distributed platform where numerous clients with high degrees of heterogeneity in data and system can collaborate to learn a model jointly. Previous research has shown that Federated Learning is effective in handling diverse data, but often assumes idealized conditions. Specifically, client participation is often simplified in these studies, while real-world factors make it difficult to predict or design individual client participation. This complexity often diverges from the ideal client participation assumption, rendering an unknown pattern of client participation, referred to as *arbitrary client participation*. Hence, it is an important open problem to explore the impact of client participation and find a lightweight mechanism to enable arbitrary client participation in FL. In this paper, we first empirically investigate the influence of client participation on FL, revealing that FL algorithms are significantly impacted by arbitrary client participation. Afterward, to alleviate the influence, we propose a lightweight solution, Federated Average with Snapshot (FAST), to unleash the almost arbitrary client participation for FL. It can seamlessly integrate with other classic FL algorithms. Specifically, FAST enforces the clients to take a snapshot once in a while and facilitates arbitrary client participation for the majority of the training process. We show the convergence rates of FAST in non-convex and strongly-convex cases, which could match the rates with those in ideal client participation. Furthermore, we empirically introduce an adaptive strategy for dynamically configuring the snapshot frequency, tailored to accommodate diverse FL systems. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate that our FAST algorithm attains significant improvements under the conditions of arbitrary client participation and highly heterogeneous data.",

                "value": "The submission considers the arbitrary client participation in federated learning. It motivates the work by presenting an experimental exploration claiming that a uniform selection of clients in every round of federated averaging performs better in terms of generalization accuracy of the trained model compared to the clients selected with $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and Weibull distributions. Thereby, it suggests that applying uniform sampling of clients intermittently between the rounds of arbitrary participation helps improve the training quality, which is also shown in the experiments. \n\nThe submission presents the convergence theory of the federated learning scheme where the number of rounds include both uniform and arbitrary client participation."

                "value": "Unsurprisingly, when several clients do not participate in over a thousand rounds of training, the quality of the trained model will degrade. The experiments corroborate this fact. It becomes stark in cases such as gamma distribution where clients ranked ~40-100 almost never participate in federation. Nevertheless, the solution that uniform client selection will be warranted for several rounds leaves the requirement to ensure the same.\n\nHere are a few rough edges:\n1. In the experiments, ten clients participated in each round; it does not fully simulate the premise of $m\\neq n$.  How about simulating something like when m>2n?\n\n2. It is a bit unfair to not compare the results with similar related works. For example, it will be interesting to see how the presented scheme compares with FedAU: \"A Lightweight Method for Tackling Unknown Participation Statistics in Federated Averaging\nShiqiang Wang, Mingyue Ji, 2024\". In this context, it is unclear what is the motivation for including FedAvgM, Tsu and Brown, 2019.\n\n3. Derivation of equation 24 is fair. However, it distracts a reader to refer to the lemmas from the cited papers too often."

Also, it will be helpful to write the lemmas from the cited papers for self-contained references."

So, it seems that $m$ means the number of clients in the FL based on the phrase \"uniform participation in every round\". Then, in (1) on page 4, the authors use $M$ to denote the total number of clients, and $M$ is not used in the algorithm or the analysis later. On the other hand, line 4 of Algorithm 1 on page 6 says that the number of uniformly random clients chosen by the server in the snapshot round is $m$. \n\nIf $m$ is just $M$, then the description \"the server enforces uniformly random clients\" in line 4 of Algorithm 1 seems to be confusing.\n\nIf $m$ and $M$ are different notions, then it seems that the convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{mKR})$ for FedAvg is based on the uniformly random participation. \n\nAdditionally, the result of convergence rate of FAST $O(1/\\sqrt{mKR})$ shown in line 7 of Table 1, the same as FedAvg with the uniform participation, seems to be from Corollary 2 on page 7. In Corollary 2, the authors suppose that $m=n$. If $m$ is just $M$, then $m=n=M$ means that FAST is trivially just like Fed-Avg based on line 4 and 6 of Algorithm 1. If $m$ and $M$ are different notions, then it seems that $m=n$ makes the difference between line 4 and 6 of Algorithm 1 negligible, since both cases need to randomly choose a subset of clients with the same size.\n\n\nCould the authors provide some clarifications on the notions of $m$ and $M$ and the usage of $m=n$ in Corollary 2?"

In real-world FL scenarios, client availability is often impacted by network limitations, resource constraints, and other unpredictable factors. If key clients are unavailable during snapshot steps, uniform participation may be incomplete, reducing the snapshots\u2019 effectiveness in mitigating biases introduced by ACP.\n\n- The adaptive mechanism for adjusting snapshot frequency based on single-round accuracy changes may be sensitive to noise, potentially leading to frequent or unnecessary adjustments. Additionally, it does not account for other factors, such as client dropout rates or long-term accuracy trends, which may reduce its robustness in highly dynamic environments.\n\n- ACP in FL can lead to a ``forgetting problem\u2019\u2019, where the model gradually loses knowledge of certain client data distributions due to inconsistent client participation, especially in highly non-IID scenarios. Although FAST's snapshot mechanism could mitigate this by enforcing periodic uniform participation, it may not fully address forgetting because: (i) Snapshot steps account for only a small portion of training rounds. Between these steps, updates are based on arbitrary participation, which could lead to a bias toward data from more frequently participating clients, causing the model to overlook less frequently updated distributions. (ii) The adaptive mechanism in Algorithm 2, which relies on immediate accuracy changes, lacks sensitivity to the gradual forgetting that can emerge in non-IID data.\n\n- The paper does not compare FAST with other adaptive participation methods, such as FedNova [1] or FedMA [2], which also address client participation variability under heterogeneous conditions. \n\n[1] Jianyu Wang, et al., Tackling the objective inconsistency problem in heterogeneous federated optimization.
