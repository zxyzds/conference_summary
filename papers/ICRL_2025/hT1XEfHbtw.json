    "title": "Variational Mode Decomposition and Linear Embeddings are What You Need For Time-Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting often faces challenges due to data volatility, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, enhancing forecast accuracy. This study integrates VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, BLSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.",

The baseline methods used in the evaluations are too generic (e.g., linear, RNN, LSTM) and not used in SOTA time series forecasts. The authors should compare the proposed method against several Transformer-based models with SOTA forecast accuracy, such as the ones reviewed in Section 2.1. \n3. The dataset size is too small since the authors only use up to 10,000 rows in each dataset (page 6). This may potentially lead to bias in the datasets and the reported evaluation metrics. The authors should use complete datasets to train and evaluate the proposed method, which should be able to handle larger datasets than 10,000 rows.\n4. Ablation studies are needed to understand the impact of different model components and hyperparameters in the model architecture. For instance, the number of modes K is an important hyperparameter to analyze via ablation studies. \n5. The authors should discuss the limitations of their work and how these limitations can be addressed in future research.\n6. The metrics for No VMD reported in Tables 1 and 2 are incorrect (probably due to typo). The value should be 1.041 instead of 1,041 (and similarly for all other values).\n7. The authors should report the size of each of the 13 datasets in Table 2."

M4 datasets consists of time series with various periodicities (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). They should all be used in the evaluations.   \n3. What is the value of K (the number of modes in VMD) used in model training? How is K selected? How does the model performance change with different values of K? Ablation studies are needed to address these questions. \n4. Why are the forecasting results of each mode summed to get the final prediction (page 6), instead of using a weighted average with fixed or learned weights?\n5. In additional to the aggregate RMSE, what are the common failure modes of VMD (e.g., fail to capture outliers)? This error audit is important to informing whether the proposed method is applicable in other domains."

                "value": "1. Although VMD is integrated, the motivation is missing in this paper. The authors are suggested to give more theoretical discussions and an intuitionistic example to strongly motivate the work. Notably, based solely on the results in Tables 1 and 2, which compare primarily with classic models like LSTM and RNN, it is difficult to discern the authors\u2019 claimed conclusion that -- ***VMD and Linear are what you need for TSF***.\n\n2. This work lacks a comprehensive analysis of existing time series forecasting and decomposition techniques. Additionally, the paper overemphasizes benchmarks against neural network models like LSTM and RNN, overlooking other competitive decomposition-based techniques or hybrid methods, such as N-BEATS (ICLR2020), OneNet (NeurIPS2023), etc.\n\n3. The mathematical foundation of the VMD model is briefly presented, but lacks an in-depth explanation of how the VMD decomposition can theoretically improve linear predictive models, for example, by connecting the VMD components to specific improvements in fluctuation mitigation or pattern separation. Besides, specific parameters and architecture choices, such as the number of modes in VMD, aren\u2019t fully justified. Also, it\u2019s unclear how sensitive the VMD-Linear model is to hyperparameter tuning (such as Lagrange multiplier $ \\lambda$ and penalty parameter $ \\alpha$), which could impact model generalizability.\n\n4. The experimental part only includes comparisons with a few classic models, making it resemble an ablation study rather than a comprehensive performance evaluation. Consequently, it is difficult to discern the actual contribution of the proposed model. Besides, the authors emphasize multivariate forecasting improvements but mainly compare against linear models without showing performance relative to advanced multivariate models or ensemble methods."

Performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results show that in multivariate settings, VMD consistently outperforms non-VMD approaches across all datasets and models, with DLinear+VMD achieving the smallest errors.
