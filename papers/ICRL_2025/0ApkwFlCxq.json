    "title": "ComputAgeBench: Epigenetic Aging Clocks Benchmark",
    "abstract": "The success of clinical trials of longevity drugs relies heavily on identifying integrative health and aging biomarkers, such as biological age. Epigenetic aging clocks predict the biological age of an individual using their DNA methylation profiles, commonly retrieved from blood samples. However, there is no standardized methodology to validate and compare epigenetic clock models as yet. We propose ComputAgeBench, a unifying framework that comprises such a methodology and a dataset for comprehensive benchmarking of different clinically relevant aging clocks. Our methodology exploits the core idea that reliable aging clocks must be able to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with aging-accelerating conditions. Specifically, we collected and harmonized 66 public datasets of blood DNA methylation, covering 19 such conditions across different ages and tested 13 published clock models. We believe our work will bring the fields of aging biology and machine learning closer together for the research on reliable biomarkers of health and aging.",

                "value": "The author introduces a benchmark designed to evaluate models of the epigenetic aging clock. The benchmark includes 66 datasets containing DNA methylation data that meet specific conditions and corresponding metadata, with a total sample size of 10,410. Four tasks are proposed to assess the models\u2019 ability to distinguish between healthy individuals(HC) and age-accelerating conditions(ACC). Results of these four tests are summarized into Cumulative Benchmarking Score. The benchmark framework also includes 13 previously published models results."

Derived from publicly accessible data, it includes processing of data from both age accelerating condition (ACC) and healthy control (HC) groups to test model\u2019s ability to distinguish between these conditions. Diseases with ACC are well considered. The benchmark includes 4 well-defined tasks with a summary score and evaluates 13 previously published models."

                "value": "The paper is well-written and comprehensive overall, but several technical points need further clarification:\n\n1. The selection of metrics for benchmark tasks requires more justification. Specifically, why do tasks 2, 3, and 4 report median instead of the mean? Additionally, task 4 mentions the \"presence of covariate shift,\" but this shift is not clearly explained. Could the authors specify the covariate shift further ?\n\n2. The rationale behind the summary benchmark score requires further explanation. Why was this scoring method chosen, and what are its advantages? Also, what does \"positive bias\" refer to in this context? In the Results section, it is stated that $S_{AA1}$ is adjusted by a ratio to penalize prediction bias, yet this concept of prediction bias remains unexplained. Further clarification on what prediction bias entails here would be beneficial.\n\n3. It appears that plots C and D in Figure 3 may be incorrectly presented. Plot D should likely represent $Med(|\\Delta|)$ rather than $Med(\\Delta)$, as all points are above the diagonal. Please clarify if this is a mislabeling or if I have misunderstood the data shown."

While no ground truth data is available for biological age (as it is a latent factor) or for age at death (as this data often isn\u2019t published), the authors offer 4 compelling metrics by which to score the models accuracy and robustness. This paper presents a resource to the community in terms of a newly published benchmarking dataset, well-motivated metrics, and ratings for the current state of the art clock models. The paper also appropriately outlines limitations, such as the fact that some datasets had poor performance across all models, raising questions about dataset shift and for what kinds of data the clocks can be expected to make sound predictions. I believe this paper will help generate scientific discussion and progress in the aging clocks research community."

It is a benchmarking paper, so while it doesn't offer a new methodology itself, it does offer original tasks/metrics for assessing the performance of these models (I think they are original, I asked for clarification in the questions section) and a standardized benchmarking dataset (I asked for clarity to confirm it will in fact be published along with this paper)"

Without standardizing the training data, it is impossible to know whether the methodology of the clock or the training data it used are contributing to better/worse performance. This insight would be critical to the community in improving clock methodologies going forward.\n- The way that the authors chose to combine benchmarks in the cumulative score requires more justification. I am not sure why the different metrics should affect each other's weights so much. A simple sum, or weighted sum, of the four variables might be more appropriate if stronger justification is not supplied.\n- Requires clarification: on the one hand, authors write \"Clearly, the first task [AA1] provides a more rigorous way to test aging clocks [compared to AA2]\" on the other hand, they write \"The most rigorous of the four, AA2 task demonstrates...\"\n- Your description of the biomarker paradox could be improved. When I first read your description, I was left with questions. I had trouble finding more info on the \"paradox of biomarkers\" using the papers you cited (possibly due to paywall issues, I couldn't see the full articles), but you might consider adding this reference _Sluiskes, Marije H., et al. \"Clarifying the biological and statistical assumptions of cross-sectional biological age predictors: an elaborate illustration using synthetic and real data.\" BMC Medical Research Methodology 24.1 (2024): 58._ as their explanation made me fully understand the problem, namely that \"a (bio)marker that perfectly correlates with chronological age is useless in estimating biological age... in principle a nearly perfect chronological age predictor can be developed, as long as the sample size is large enough [35]. In such a case all signal related to biological aging would be lost.\"\n\nMore broadly, while I really enjoyed the paper, I am not sure it is a great fit for the ICLR community, as this model is a predictive regression model and not in the space of representation learning."

Inferring the biological age of an individual can hardly be considered as learning representations. The machine learning methods used for deriving aging clocks are very well known and established, thus lacking novelty. The tasks presented in the paper to assess the clocks' performances are not totally novel, as the authors themselves point out in section 2.2.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, an important aspect that the paper does not address is preprocessing. Several normalization methods exist for methylation data, and their impact to downstream analysis is well documented (see for example Teschendorff et al. 2013). A robust benchmark should try to evaluate the effect of different normalization methods on aging clock performances. \n\nA minor issue the authors may want to consider: the long list of reference at page 6 could be placed in the appendix, to ease reading\n\nAndrew E.

Including these would improve the dataset's representativeness for broader applications. \n\n  \n\n2. **Data Balance and Bias**: The authors do not address balance across categories (e.g., AACs vs. healthy controls) or potential sampling biases. This oversight may skew benchmarking results and limit generalizability. \n\n  \n\n3. **Absence of Bias Mitigation**: No strategies are mentioned to detect or reduce dataset biases, which is crucial for fair benchmarking in aging prediction models, where demographic factors can affect DNA methylation patterns and model performance. Additional evaluation metrics for fairness would  increase the strength of this benchmark. \n\n  \n\n4. **Put Together Publicly Available Dataset**: The proposed dataset, to my understanding,  is a collection of existing publicly available datasets. The authors do not present to the research community a new benchmarking dataset, they rather collect existing datasets that they put together with a published harmonization technique.  \n\nThe fact that the datasets already exist publicly, reduces the novelty of the benchmark.
