    "abstract": "\\textbf{Grokking}, or the \\textbf{delayed generalization phenomenon}, describes the abrupt and rapid improvement in test accuracy that occurs after a model has been overfitted for a prolonged period. This phenomenon was first identified by Power in the context of operations on a prime number field. Over the past two years, a range of mathematical analyses has been conducted to investigate grokking, typically involving the use of the hidden progress measure which mean a function that can anticipate the occurrence of grokking. We believe that a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical modeling approach can invigorate the research on this task and provide a unified perspective for understanding previous research. This paper introduces a novel approach by modeling the task as a unique dynamical system. Using mathematical derivation within this framework, we propose a robust hidden progress measure that effectively captures the grokking phenomenon across all operations on prime number fields. This approach not only provides a more complete understanding but also offers deeper insights into the underlying architecture of the model. Based on this understanding, we also proposed a method to accelerate grokking without involving regularization or altering the model architecture.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I found this paper challenging to read. The language is unclear and the figures are repetitive and not particularly informative. While I understand the concept of modeling neural network updates as an ODE, it is not clear what is the exact dynamical system described in this paper. The lack of clarity is endemic to this work, as in all main equations in this paper (1-3, 4-6, and 7-9), it is left unexplained what their different components are. I believe that W & U are neural network parameters, but what are x, e, y, gamma, s, c, u, and w? The authors should make abundantly clear what are the roles of the different parameters in the system they model.\nAll this makes the \"theoretical\" part of this paper extremely hard to follow. While I could vaguely figure out the authors are attempting to make a claim regarding the existence of stable points relating to the neural network parameters, it is not obvious what that claim is, how they arrive at it, and why it is in any way relevant to grokking. The authors need to do a better job at explaining these extremely critical details.\n\nIn the second part, the authors introduce \"Main embedding diff\" (MED), a way of tracking grokking by measuring discrepancy between embeddings within a model. There seems to be no relationship between the first section and this one, and the paper is unclear as to what MED is, as the components laid out in eq 12 are not explained to the reader. The results consist of repetitions of the same figure presenting the grokking phenomena along with MED values during training for different model and task settings. Aside from MED being vaguely correlated with the grokking phenomena, it is not explained how it precisely relates to it. Furthermore, the paper only presents results for a single task (modular addition), while the original grokking work discusses several types of problems. \n\nOverall, while the paper attempts to make theoretical contributions to understanding grokking, its unclear presentation, disconnected sections and weak results make it difficult to assess its actual scientific merit or practical value."

                "value": "There are several major weaknesses of this paper: \n\n1. It was unclear to me what the embedding described in Section 3 is. Because this was unclear, much of the rest of the work was unclear. I would strongly recommend spending time making this section as clear as possible. In particular, \n     a. Figure 2 says that $p$ symbols are used to represent the range $0$ to $p - 1$. What does this mean? Are these the embeddings, $\\textbf{p}$. Is $p$ the same as the prime $p$ used in modular arthimetic?\n      b. What is $c$ and $\\gamma$? From context, I would assume that $c$ is the target output and $\\gamma$ is the error, but this was never defined. What size is $c$?\n      c. When is logit used? \n\n2. The establishment of the model was also confusing. In particular, explaining what the sums in Eqs. 4-5 are over (and why there are sums) would be helpful in understanding what the authors did. \n\n3. The authors make several assumptions that are not justified or motivated. For instance, Assumption 1 and 2 come out of nowhere. Similarly, saying $\\alphda_d$ is \"guessed to be approximately a linear function in specific situations\" is very vague. \n\n4. The main result (Theorem 4) is not stated mathematically and is vague. It was not clear what was really being gained from the theorem, nor was it clear how this was proven.\n\n5. The progress measure (Eq. 12) is defined to be a function of $n$ but $n$ is not present in any of the equations. This makes it unclear what Pro 1 is saying. \n\n6. \"According to our theory, another factor that influences the rate of grokking is the size of d_model\". It is not clear to me where the size of d_model comes in to the results presented in the main text. \n\n7. The authors claim that increasing the size of the dataset affects the rate of grokking. But then they choose to increase $p$ and not $\\beta$. The rationale for this was not clear. Additionally, given the bounds given in Sec, 5.2.2. $\\beta$ and $p$ are in the numerator. Therefore, increasing either leads to greater norm, which I thought meant longer time to achive high test accuracy. \n\n8. The mitigation of grokking (Figure 7) is interesting, but it is not clear how the authors use their previous results to choose a Toeplitz matrix. If anything, it feels like cheating slightly since the task is periodic and they choose a circulant matrix (or maybe not cheating, but rather they use features of the task instead of the dynamical systems picture they have developed). \n\n9. There are a number of major typos, including sentences that do not make grammatical sense, sentences that end abruptly, and mis-spelling that makes reading this manuscript challenging."
