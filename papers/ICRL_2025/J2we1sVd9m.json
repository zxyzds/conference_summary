    "abstract": "Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for improving the reliability of deep neural networks in the real-world deployment. In this paper, inspired by the inherent distribution shift between ID and OOD data, we propose a novel method that leverages optimal transport to measure the distribution discrepancy between test inputs and ID prototypes. The resulting transport costs are used to quantify the individual contribution of each test input to the overall discrepancy, serving as a desirable measure for OOD detection. To address the issue that solely relying on the transport costs to ID prototypes is inadequate for identifying OOD inputs closer to ID data, we generate virtual outliers to approximate the OOD region via linear extrapolation. By combining the transport costs to ID prototypes with the costs to virtual outliers, the detection of OOD data near ID data is emphasized, thereby enhancing the distinction between ID and OOD inputs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.",

It first constructed the prototype of each class as the average representation for that class extracted from the feature encoder, then computed the optimal transport between the encoded feature of the test inputs and the class prototypes and used the sum of the transport costs from a test input to prototypes as an indication of the input's outlier-ness. It then noted that only using this is insufficient for detecting OOD data closer to ID, and proposed to generate virtual outliers by linear extrapolation between the prototypes and the mean of the test inputs, and finally used the difference between the transport cost to the ID prototypes and the cost to the virtual outliers as the final OOD score.\n\nThe work then performed extensive experiments. The results showed that the proposed method often outperforms the competitors and gets close-to-best performance otherwise. It can be used with different pretraining schemes without graceful performance degradation, and can use the network weights as the ID prototypes when training data are not available. Ablation study shows that the virtual outliers are important for the performance, and that the method is robust to hyperparameters: the extrapolation coefficient, the regularization coefficient, and the test batch size."

Standard approaches have increasingly focused on understanding geometric representations in neural networks, either through uncertainty estimation [1] or, more rigorously, likelihood estimation [2], sometimes aided by reconstruction autoencoders [3]. Given the connection between geometric representation and OT through the transport map, I would expect interpretative insights along this line rather than a direct application of OT for OOD detection. Without this, the current proposal, in my opinion, is incremental compared to the existing distance-based approaches.\n\nThe method presentation is not clear. I have some confusion in terms of how the OT plan is constructed using both in-distribution (ID) inputs and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. See question (1).\n\nFinally, similar ideas of using optimal transport to characterize OOD error have been explored with more concrete theoretically properties, as in [4].\n\n[1] Cao, Senqi, and Zhongfei Zhang. \"Deep hybrid models for out-of-distribution detection.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n[2] Kamkari, Hamidreza, et al. \"A Geometric Explanation of the Likelihood OOD Detection Paradox.\" Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning.\n\n[3] Zhou, Yibo. \"Rethinking reconstruction autoencoder-based out-of-distribution detection.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n[4] Lu, Yuzhe, et al.

As such, I'm not sure how varying the test batch size affect the result. Are we computing a distinct transport map for every test batch size? if so how do we decide the threshold for OOD samples for these test batch size?
