    "title": "FSL-MIC: An Attentional Few-Shot Learning Framework for EEG Motor Imagery Classification",
    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a key non-invasive technique used to investigate brain activity, particularly in motor imagery (MI) research. Traditional methods for classifying EEG signals often rely on handcrafted features and heuristic parameters, which can limit generalization across tasks and subjects. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly few-shot learning (FSL), offer promising alternatives to improve classification accuracy in scenarios with limited training data. This study explores the effectiveness of FSL algorithms, including Relation Networks, to enhance MI classification. It also examines how transfer learning and data augmentation techniques contribute to improving classification performance.\n\nWe propose a novel framework with three core modules\u2014feature embedding, attention, and relation\u2014that facilitates the classification of unseen subject categories using only a few labeled samples. The attention mechanism identifies key features related to the query data, while the relation module predicts query labels by modeling relationships between support and query data across subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, BCI 2a and BCI 2b, as well as our experimental dataset. The proposed FSL framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering promising applications in real-time Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems across various EEG setups. This research advances the understanding of machine learning in EEG applications and highlights the potential of FSL techniques in overcoming the challenges of limited training data in MI classification.",

During the meta training, the model\u2019s goal is to uncover common patterns among these tasks and acquire broad knowledge that can be applied in solving new tasks. However, the authors apply very few tasks, specifically left and right hand classification, and these tasks are directly related to downstream applications. The stated motivation for meta-learning is somewhat limited. The authors should clearly indicate how they train their framework in a meta-learning fashion. \n\n(2)\tMotivation \u2013 The authors propose to use few-shot learning, where the model should be trained on very limited data. However, the authors only use the few-shot examples as the \u201csupport set\u201d during the testing phase, which could leak classification information.\n\n(3)\tRelated Works \u2013 Many related works are indeed missing in the field, such as Hou et al., GCNs-Net: A Graph Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Decoding Time-Resolved EEG Motor Imagery Signals, In IEEE TNNLS.\n\n(4)\tExperiments \u2013 The authors are encouraged to conduct experiments on larger benchmarks, such as the PhysioNet dataset and the High Gamma dataset.\n\n(5)    The authors should provide high-quality figures."

                "value": "**Major Concerns and Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. Limited Novelty in Approach and Research Question\n    * While the problem is essential, the paper does not introduce significant advancements in methodology or approach, primarily adapting existing frameworks for few-shot learning.\n    * The techniques, including data augmentation and attention mechanisms, are well-known and lack customization to the problem at hand.\n2. Insufficient Literature Review\n    * The manuscript leans heavily on a limited set of cited works, neglecting a broader body of relevant and foundational literature. This oversight is evident, for example, in the omission of a citation for the seminal paper on the attention mechanism (Vaswani, A. \"Attention is all you need.\" (2017)), which is essential for context or the omission of the Grad-CAM paper (Selvaraju, Ramprasaath R., et al. \"Grad-cam: Visual explanations from deep networks via gradient-based localization.\"\u00a0(2017)), or proper citation to the utilized baseline methods, etc.\n    * The limited literature results in redundancy, where the few sources cited appear multiple times, reducing the depth of the discussion.\n3. Redundant Content and Limited Focus on Methodology\n    * A large portion of the paper is dedicated to reintroducing prior works and discussing the dataset, with limited space allocated to details of the proposed method.\n    * The method's description lacks sufficient depth to fully understand its contribution beyond existing frameworks, making it challenging to assess its true impact.\n4. Results and Experimental Design\n    * The reported results do not demonstrate outperformance over baseline models (CNN-attention-All and CNN-attention-Few). This lack of improvement questions the validity of the proposed framework as a state-of-the-art advancement in EEG classification.\n    * It is unclear why the authors have not tested their own method using a 40-sample case, as they did with CNN-attention baselines. Including this setup would provide a more equitable basis for comparison, potentially even enhancing the own results. The authors do not address any limitations that might prevent this configuration, leaving the rationale for this decision unclear.\n    * The experimental design could be expanded to assess the model\u2019s performance to a broader range of baseline methods.\n  5. Interpretability of Attention Mechanism\nOne of the noted strengths of the proposed framework is its attention mechanism. However, while the authors suggest interpretability as a benefit, no specific analysis or visualization is provided to demonstrate how the attention scores contribute to understanding EEG signal dynamics. Adding such interpretability analysis would clarify the attention module\u2019s effectiveness in isolating relevant features in EEG data.\n\n\n**Minor Concern:**\n\nPresentation and Figure Quality: The quality of figures is low, which detracts from the visual clarity and effectiveness of the results. Enhancing figure resolution would improve the readability and professional presentation of the study.\n\n**Recommendation for Extended Testing on Diverse Tasks:**\nGiven the framework's potential for adaptation beyond EEG data, the authors could include further testing on additional EEG classification tasks or even generalize their method to other time-series datasets. This would reinforce the flexibility and generalizability of the FSL-MIC model and provide a more robust foundation for the claimed broader applicability.\n\n\nThe paper requires major revisions, including a more comprehensive literature review, expanded experiments, and detailed methodology. Enhancing the experimental setup and introducing a wider array of baselines could make this work more impactful."

Could you expand on how FSL-MIC claims to improve upon state-of-the-art methods, especially given the similar or lower performance metrics?\n\n* Since the attention mechanism is highlighted as a significant feature of the proposed framework, are there plans to analyze or visualize the attention scores for interpretability?
