    "title": "CausalVE: Face Video Privacy Encryption via Causal Video Prediction",
    "abstract": "Advanced facial recognition technologies and recommender systems with inadequate privacy technologies and policies for facial interactions increase concerns about bioprivacy violations. With the proliferation of video and live-streaming websites, public-face video distribution and interactions pose greater privacy risks. Existing techniques typically address the risk of sensitive biometric information leakage through various privacy enhancement methods but pose a higher security risk by corrupting the information to be conveyed by the interaction data, or by leaving certain biometric features intact that allow an attacker to infer sensitive biometric information from them. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a neural network framework, CausalVE. We obtain cover images by adopting a diffusion model to achieve face swapping with face guidance and use the speech sequence features and spatiotemporal sequence features of the secret video for dynamic video inference and prediction to obtain a cover video with the same number of frames as the secret video. In addition, we hide the secret video by using reversible neural networks for video hiding so that the video can also disseminate secret data. Numerous experiments prove that our CausalVE has good security in public video dissemination and outperforms state-of-the-art methods from a qualitative, quantitative, and visual point of view.",

                "value": "The paper proposes CausalVE, a face video privacy protection framework that combines (1) a diffusion model for face swapping with facial guidance, (2) a video prediction method that uses speech and spatiotemporal visual features of the secret facial video to generate a realistic cover video, and (3) a reversible neural network to embed the secret video within the cover video. This reversible neural network enables retrieval of the original video using a specific key. By balancing data concealment with coherent video output, CausalVE aims to enhance privacy protection beyond traditional methods. Evaluation results indicate that CausalVE effectively safeguards private information, outperforming baseline methods."

                "value": "1. The paper could mislead readers into believing that the entire video frame is processed and hidden rather than just the facial region. Since the facial region occupies only part of a frame, the data requirements for concealing and generating only the face differ substantially from handling the entire frame. Clarifying this distinction early on would improve readability and prevent misunderstandings.\n\n2. Due to the potential for confusion about the processing scope, it\u2019s unclear whether the paper makes fair comparisons with other methods. For example, did it use the same cropped facial region as a hidden element for fair benchmarking with other baselines?\n\n3. The paper's references to 3D-based deepfake techniques are somewhat outdated. Incorporating recent literature such as those in [*] would provide a more current perspective on related methodologies.\n\n4. The framework\u2019s computational demands are significant, which could limit accessibility and scalability for resource-limited settings.\n\n[*] Pei, Gan, Jiangning Zhang, Menghan Hu, Zhenyu Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yunsheng Wu, Guangtao Zhai, Jian Yang, Chunhua Shen, and Dacheng Tao. \"Deepfake generation and detection: A benchmark and survey.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.17881 (2024)."

Extensive experiments show that CausalVE effectively secures public video dissemination and surpasses current methods in both quality and privacy protection.\n\nAccording to the author's statement, this research is indeed a hot field.

Specifically, I do not see the significance of restoring the original video. The primary purpose of privacy protection is to eliminate sensitive information. In particular, \"irreversibility\" would more effectively enhance the strength of privacy protection. The authors need to clarify the scenarios in which reversibility is applicable.\n\n2. Implementation Approach is Unreasonable: The authors propose hiding a secret video within a cover video to protect facial privacy. However, I find this approach difficult to accept. This is because the secret video and the cover video share highly similar content (i.e., attributes other than identity), making it unnecessary to hide the secret video directly. In other words, since the only difference between the secret and cover videos is the identity, would it not be more feasible to simply hide the identity instead? \n\n3. Technical Innovation is Weak: The authors have integrated techniques such as face swapping, video prediction, and video steganography to construct the CausalVE framework, which makes it hard to identify any significant technical innovation in this work. The three contributions mentioned in the \"primary contributions\" section are all achievable by existing methods; this paper merely applies these techniques to facial privacy protection.\n\n4. Insufficient Experimental Evaluation: (1) Incorrect Comparison Trials: This work aims to protect facial privacy, and it should be compared with existing facial privacy protection methods rather than video steganography, like [1] or [2]. (2) Robustness Evaluation: Videos encoded in different formats may lose some information. Can this framework still achieve reversibility under such conditions?\n\n[1]The UU-Net_ Reversible Face De-Identification for Visual Surveillance Video Footage.\n[2]IdentityMask_Deep_Motion_Flow_Guided_Reversible_Face_Video_De-identification\n\n5. Practicality of the Work is Poor: The proposed framework incorporates various technologies and losses, making it difficult for users to understand. Additionally, the use of time-consuming techniques such as diffusion models results in high energy consumption and latency for CausalVE, complicating its integration into practical applications."
