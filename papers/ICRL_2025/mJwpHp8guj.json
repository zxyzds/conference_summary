    "title": "Unlocking Full Dynamic Optimization of District Energy Systems through State-Space Model Learning",
    "abstract": "Predictive control enables the operation of physical systems along an optimal trajectory based on forecasts and dynamic simulations. However, the complexity of system dynamics and high computational cost of optimization typically restrict the optimization window to short horizons. Thus, any potential benefits from mid- and long-term rewards are withdrawn. This is particularly relevant for optimization of district energy systems using various low-environmental-impact sources. To address this, we present an end-to-end methodological framework for learning state-space representations of such systems that significantly reduce computational load. The proposed approach leverages the implicit graph structure of such systems to develop and train a physics-informed spatio-temporal graph neural network. This methodology is evaluated on a real-world district heating system incorporating thermal solar panels, storage, biomass and natural gas boilers. Through historical time-series data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization, the learned model demonstrates strong generalization ability and high accuracy in predicting system dynamics. Our method reduces simulation time by four orders of magnitude, cutting optimization time from several days to mere minutes, while also lowering operational costs by up to 25%.",

It is unclear why such algorithm is selected, and how the algorithm performs with model-based RL or model-free decision-making approaches.\n\nThe use of STGCN in dynamics modeling and decision making are not novel contributions of this work. It is a mere application of the previous packages.\n\nThe abstract described about long-term reward, but it is unclear how the proposed method tackle such issue.\n\nThere is a lack of comparison to other methods, and the testing case seem to be very specific to one private dataset.\n\nSome minor errors: \nLine 209 \"each of the clusters\"-> \"each of the cluster\";"

I notice the authors compared performance in Table 3, but the settings are very unclear.\n\n(c). Why the method is described as an end-to-end approach? The surrogate modeling and control part are separate.\n\n(d). Can the authors show some control curves, the state variables before and after the controls? This would help validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.\n\n(e). Can the authors describe in more details for current methods, why the computation time are much longer than the proposed method? Is that due to the intractability of the formulated MPC problem, or due to the small simulation resolution, or due to the existence of constraints? \n\n(f). How do the proposed method scale up to larger district networks?\n\n(g). Are their any noises throughout the sensing, measuring, and control procedures? How do they affect the algorithm design?"

The main contribution is PI-STGCN, a neural network-based model that is trained to approximate the dynamics by minimizing a supervised loss with an additional soft constraint representing mass flow rate conservation. The authors present results demonstrating that this surrogate model captures both fast and slow dynamical patterns within the system. PI-STGCN is then used within an optimal control loop, which is optimized using genetic algorithms. The authors show that this approach improves system costs compared to the business-as-usual system operation, while being significantly faster to run than MPC."

There should be a more extensive comparison against baselines and alternative methods.\n   * The comparisons with respect to control performance seem incomplete. In particular, there is little transparency on what control method is used to generate the \"real costs.\" In addition, while timing performance is shown for MPC, the control costs are not shown for MPC. More extensive comparison against baselines and alternative methods is likewise necessary.\n   * Ablation studies are needed to demonstrate that all parts of the proposed algorithmic pipeline are indeed necessary, as there are many moving pieces to the proposed methodology.\n* The writing and presentation could use some improvement. This includes:\n    * Ensuring all terms are defined in the main body of the paper, alongside where they are used.\n    * Ensuring the main body of the paper is self-contained with respect to the methodology. Notably, details on the genetic algorithm-based optimization of the control loop are relatively sparse.\n    * Improving the discussion of prior work. Despite the existing discussion of prior work, it is not clear what exactly is the state-of-the-art upon which this paper improves (and this is further exacerbated by the lack of comparisons in the experiments).\n\nI also have several questions, which may or may not indicate weaknesses:\n* A Gaussian jittering approach may lead to time series that have the exact \"convenient\" type of noise/deviation from the original signal that it is easy for neural networks to smooth out. Is the evaluation in Figure 5 on those same Gaussian-jittered time series on which the model was trained, or on a different \"hold out\" set of time series?\n* How \"good\" are the MSEs in Table 2 (relating to out-of-distribution dynamics)? Is it possible to see a plot in order to visually inspect how well the out-of-distribution dynamics were learned?\n* In Section 4.3, it is claimed that by learning a neural network surrogate for the dynamics, it is no longer necessary to view the control problem as a constrained problem. Could the authors provide more substantiation for this claim? Is this claim solely based on the observation that constraints were satisfied in Figure 5 (evaluation of the dynamics learned by PI-STGCN), or is there theoretical proof? If the former, then it would be seriously important to also report on constraint satisfaction performance in Section 4.3 / Table 5 (evaluation of control performance)."

                "value": "1. While the writing quality was mostly good, there were some issues that need to be resolved. For example, some typos persist throughout the paper, such as the misspelling of \u201ctechnique\u201d as \u201ctechnic\u201d on lines 42 and 50, and confusing \u201coptimized\u201d and \u201coptimal\u201d on line 512. \nThere were also several examples of awkward writing, such as \n\\\n\u201cThe acceleration of complex and traditional simulations is one of the fields where deep learning models offer an appealing alternative, technically called surrogate models (SM)\u201d\n\\\n\u201cA detailed presentation of the genetic algorithm implementation using pymoo library is provided in appendix A.2 after\u201d\n\\\nThe writing was also hyperbolic in some cases, such as \n\u201cOur work completes the related studies by employing a versatile neural network architecture that is application-agnostic, making it suitable for district energy systems.\u201d\n\\\nAnother issue is that some terms are not defined. For example, the authors referenced \u201cweak augmentation T_1\u201d on line 337, but I could not find this defined anywhere, neither in the paper nor in the reference it cited.\n\n2. Assuming we have an accurate predictive model, genetic algorithms are a strange choice of baseline. The results were good enough that I am not denying the efficacy of genetic algorithms, but there needs to be more motivation behind why this was chosen as opposed to other MPC or RL control algorithms.\n\n3. Claims of the speedup relative to other systems as \u201c4 orders of magnitutde\u201d seems wildly exaggerated for the following reasons:\n\\\na. Their model is being compared with a \u201chigh fidelity numerical model\u201d. However, we are not given details of this model at all! This is a glaring lacuna. Further, we do not know what hardware it is run. Conversely, their alg makes use of a V100 GPU, which is a significant amount of compute\n\\\nb. Their model required hyperparameter tuning, with 150 sampled configurations with 30 epochs each. This cost is simply ignored in the comparison\n\\\nc. The selfsame expensive \u201chigh fidelity numerical model\u201d is used in the data augmentation pipeline. This cost is completely omitted as well.\n\n4. The fact that the \u201chigh fidelity numerical model\u201d, also referred to at times as the \u201csimulator\u201d is not clearly defined is a glaring omission. Not just because this makes computational comparisons impossible to verify, as discussed above, but also because this model is used in the data augmentation pipeline. Furthermore, if this highly accurate model exists, why do we not have a baseline comparing performance gains when we use it for MPC? In this regard, Table 3 is highly misleading. It compares performance on real data vs their method, but computation is a comparison of their method vs using MPC. Surprisingly missing is the performance of the MPC model!\n\n5. The authors claim, as early as the abstract, that \u201cThis methodology is evaluated on a real-world district heating system incorporating thermal solar panels, storage, biomass and natural gas boilers.\u201d Initially, this claim really excited me, but as I read the paper I found it highly misleading as well. \n\\\nThis implies a live trial on a real system. However, what was actually performed was a comparison of real offline data, and the performance of their model on a high fidelity simulator. This is decidedly NOT a real world evaluation. Furthermore, since the very evaluation model, the high fidelity numerical model, is also used in the augmentation pipeline, this is a serious evaluation issue. For example, in section 4.1 the model is compared with the simulator, but since it was trained on augmented data from the simulator, this is equivalent to showing performance on the training set."

How does the hyper param tuning and data augmentation factor in to the speedup? We cannot ignore this, even if the actual simulation time once it is done is much faster\n\n5. Did you use the same simulator both to augment the dataset, and to evaluate the model? Can you provide clarification on why this is not simply overfitting to the simulator?"
