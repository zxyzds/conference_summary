    "title": "KinPFN: Bayesian Approximation of RNA Folding Kinetics using Prior-Data Fitted Networks",
    "abstract": "RNA is a dynamic biomolecule crucial for cellular regulation, with its function largely determined by its folding into complex structures, while misfolding can lead to multifaceted biological sequelae. During the folding process, RNA traverses through a series of intermediate structural states, with each transition occurring at variable rates that collectively influence the time required to reach the functional form. Understanding these folding kinetics is vital for predicting RNA behavior and optimizing applications in synthetic biology and drug discovery. While in silico kinetic RNA folding simulators are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, accurate approximations of the folding times can already be very informative to assess the efficiency of the folding process. In this work, we present KinPFN, a novel approach that leverages prior-data fitted networks to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of RNA folding times. By training on synthetic data representing arbitrary prior folding times, KinPFN efficiently approximates the cumulative distribution function of RNA folding times in a single forward pass, given only a few initial folding time examples. Our method offers a modular extension to existing RNA kinetics algorithms, promising significant computational speed-ups orders of magnitude faster, while achieving comparable results. We showcase the effectiveness of KinPFN through extensive evaluations and real-world case studies, demonstrating its potential for RNA folding kinetics analysis, its practical relevance, and generalization to other biological data.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a model for predicting RNA folding dynamics called KinPFN. Specifically, this work focuses on computing the time needed for an RNA to fold into a specific structure (i.e., the first passage time). KinPFN uses a prior-data fitted network (PFN) that is calibrated using a sample of synthetic first passage time to predict entire cumulative distribution or RNA structures. The methodology is benchmarked on random and real sequences, and the paper concludes with an illustration of an application to gene expression.\n\nOverall, the methodology is sound, and the results are convincing. The development of RNA folding dynamics prediction tools is timely and only a limited set of programs are currently available. Furthermore, machine learning approaches seem suited to this task, and, to my knowledge, this contribution is the first of its kind. The contributed approach is still a proof-of-concept, but it provides solid ground for further exploration of ML. The manuscript is clear and well written, yet it could benefit of clarifications suggested below."

The machine learning component is a bit limited but I believe fits the broad definition of originality and significance through \"application to a new domain.\" The authors basically apply one existing framework (prior-data filtering networks or PFNs) to model RNA folding dynamics. The innovative aspect of this work is thus rather the application to RNA folding. The research is timely, and the gain in speed could lead to interesting RNA design applications. The authors mention it but do not discuss it much. However, even if it is still very early, there are interesting/promising applications at the end of the paper. It is a clean and solid piece of work from which could emerge highly useful applications."

                "value": "\u2022\tAs far as I understand it, the structural model is based on secondary structures and uses (for simulations) the nearest neighbor (NN) energy model. The application to secondary structure is only partially described in the paper. It is an important limitation, and I am concerned that readers may miss this information. I would suggest updating Fig. 2 (reproduced from Muller et al, 2022) to include more details on the sampling (e.g., using a secondary structure model and kinfold) and eventually on the benchmark too. This is just a suggestion as the author(s) may prefer to include this information at other places of the manuscript (e.g., expand the background section to describe the folding model).\n\u2022\tA claim of the paper is to drastically accelerate folding simulation. I agree this is a nice feature, but I also wonder to what extent it is currently a major bottleneck (for biologists) or what new applications it will enable. I think the manuscript could benefit from further justifications/motivations. For instance, the usefulness of KinPFN for design applications sounds very promising, and I would have liked more discussion (or experiments?) related to this topic. Moreover, since the models currently use kinfold simulations, it could be limited by the accuracy of the NN energy model, which has limitations on longer RNAs. Maybe KinPFN offers new perspectives to deal with this challenge?\n\u2022\tIt is not clear to me that PFNs perform much better than other options (e.g., KDEs) but at least they seem to be suited to the task. Table 1 compares KinPFN to DP-GMM and KDE models. The performance of KDEs seem very close to KingPFN, and I wonder if the author(s) could provide more context in the main body to discuss the significance of the results (e.g., from supp mat H.2)?\n\u2022\tFig. 3a shows a distribution of the performance across RNAs of various lengths. It may be out of the scope of this manuscript, but I would be interested to understand better how other features such as the nucleotide composition, MFE value, number of base pairs or loops, etc. impact the results. Also, how does KinPFN perform on multi-stable RNAs?"

In this case, the prior dastset is created from a synthetic prior. The authors put a great deal of effort into hand-crafting this prior (e.g. using biological prior knowledge) that will then be used to train their PFN. The result is a prior that is able to train a PFN that predicts FPT better than competing methods, such as KDE, GMM, and DP-GMMs. The paper's biological motivation is sound and the achievement would help researchers in this field. However, the paper has room for improvement to be published at ICLR instead of a computational biology journal. Why not make the prior adaptive based on the data? There is opportunity to solve this problem that wouldn't require hand-crafting a new prior, or, make it more general for different datasets that would make it an _excellent_ contribution.\n\nThe paper's prose is clear. I do think that some of the tables could be rearranged to give the reader more clear insights into how the method works, which I relay below."

The paper needs to further elucidate how this study can contribute to solving RNA biology problems.\n5.\tIn the experimental section, the results from Kinfold are used for validation, but the inherent error of Kinfold needs rigorous demonstration, which diminishes the persuasiveness of the results.
