    "title": "Robust Spike-based Decoupled Federated Information Bottleneck Learning with Spiking Neural Network under System Heterogeneity",
    "abstract": "As embedded devices become increasingly prevalent in intelligent systems, low-power system in resource-constrained environments has emerged as a key challenge. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their sparse and event-driven computation, have shown great potential as a low-power candidate for embedded devices. In federated learning scenarios, where multiple energy-constrained devices collaborate, adopting efficient SNN models with effective training methods is critical. However, research on training SNNs within federated learning systems is still very limited, particularly in terms of how to achieve both energy efficiency and robustness under system heterogeneity. This gap presents a significant opportunity for further exploration of SNNs in distributed learning settings. In this paper, we investigate a significant and innovative problem in robust spike-based federated learning, particularly in the presence of noise, and system heterogeneity. We majorly consider two types of system heterogeneity in this study, including data and client participation heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a novel federated learning framework, spike-based decoupled federated information-bottleneck learning (SDFIL), to enable robust, low-power federated learning through SNNs under system heterogeneity. Specifically, we design a decoupled information bottleneck principle tailored for local SNN training to maximize the mutual information between ground truth and model predictions while minimizing mutual information between intermediate representations. This method effectively minimizes the impact of outliers in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data on model updates, thereby enhancing the performance of federated SNNs, resulting in enhanced robustness and reduced sensitivity to outliers. We evaluate the proposed SDFIL algorithm across a variety of settings, including different noise levels and varying degrees of system heterogeneity. The experimental results indicate that SDFIL demonstrates superior robustness compared to competing methods and generally achieves an improvement in overall accuracy of 5\\% to 10\\%. Additionally, it can achieve up to 7.7\u00d7 higher energy efficiency compared to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs).",

                "value": "1.From the perspective of SNN: The relationship between the core method proposed in this paper and SDFIL is unclear. There is no part in eq 6-22 that is intrinsically related to SNN. In my opinion, the SNN mentioned in this paper is only loosely coupled, and at most proves the feasibility of combining this framework with SNN. The low energy consumption advantage demonstrated by the authors in 4.4 seems to benefit from SNN and has little to do with the proposed method.\n\n2.From the perspective of Theory: The core contribution of the paper, ie then eq 6-22, appears rather trivial. The application of the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework to SNNs and federated learning follows standard techniques. The core ideas of maximizing mutual information and minimizing redundant representations are well-established, and the paper fails to convincingly justify the need for these extensions specifically in the context of SNNs. The theoretical derivation is largely similar to traditional variational lower bounds and does not provide substantial innovation targeting the unique properties of SNNs.\n\n3.From the claim of the author: \"we methodically address client participation heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and gradient noise\". The introduction of \"decoupling\" in eq 20-22 is not sufficiently justified. While decoupling hidden representations might intuitively seem beneficial, the theoretical basis for its effectiveness within SNNs and federated learning is weak. The authors provide no rigorous analysis demonstrating how or why this approach would enhance robustness to noise or improve model scalability under system heterogeneity, making the proposed method appear more like a direct adaptation of existing IB models.\n\n4.From the experimental perspective: The experiments on cifar10 and cigar100 are too small to fully demonstrate the advantages and necessity of federated learning as claimed by the authors. Please consider at least adding larger-scale experiments such as imagenet. Although in the context of federated learning, the method proposed by the authors shows advantages, the acc of ~75% on cifar10 and ~50% on cifar100 make it difficult to believe that the algorithm has the ability to scale to larger real-world datasets."
