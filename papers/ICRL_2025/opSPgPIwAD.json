    "title": "Everyone Deserves Recourse: Feasible Recourse Paths Using Data Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Decisions made using machine learning models can negatively impact individuals\nin critical applications such as healthcare and finance by denying essential services\nor access to opportunity. Algorithmic recourse supplements a negative AI decision\nby providing rejected individuals with advice on the changes they can make to their\nprofiles, so that they may eventually achieve the desired outcome. Most existing\nrecourse methods provide single-step changes by using counterfactual explanations.\nThese counterfactual explanations are computed assuming a fixed (not learned)\ndistance function. Further, few works consider providing more realistic multi-step\nchanges in the form of recourse paths. However, such methods may fail to provide\nany recourse path for some individuals or provide paths that might not be feasible,\nsince intermediate steps needed to reach the counterfactual explanation may not\nbe realizable. We introduce a framework for learning an optimal distance function\nand threshold to compute multi-step recourse paths for all. First, we formalize the\nproblem of finding multi-step recourse paths. Given a set of feasible transitions, we\npropose a data-driven framework for learning the optimal distance and threshold\nfor each step with PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) guarantees. Finally,\nwe provide a data augmentation algorithm to ensure that a solution exists for all\nindividuals. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method learns\nfeasible recourse paths for all individuals.",

                "value": "This paper considers the path-based recourse: instead of viewing recourse as a terminal node, this paper considers the whole path from the original input to the terminal node. I agree that a path-based is more friendly because it provides a step-by-step guidance to flip the prediction of the algorithm. Path-based recourses relies on the construction of a graph. The specific problem considered in this paper is that the graph may not be connected. As a consequence, there may not exist a path to reach the positive region.\n\nTo solve the problem, the paper considers augmenting data: adding new nodes with connecting edges to the graph. By doing this, the paper guarantees that every input has a feasible path."

Simply augmenting points to make the graph connected could not solve the root cause of the problem. \n\n2. The augmented nodes lacks interpretability. There is no argument to support that the new nodes correspond to feasible features in the real world. Thus, one could not guarantee that the proposed path is realistic."

How is the Mahalanobis distance defined in the experiment?\n\n3. Should $\\tau$ be tuned or should be learnt. In my opinion, I think $\\tau$ should be tuned: it depicts the maximal efforts that the model requires in each transition. It is unclear to me why it should be learned in this paper. For an input without a path, then the model can simply inform the person that the effort threshold should be increased in order to obtained a feasible path. The model can also recommend different paths for different levels of $\\tau$, which can totally resolve the unconnectedness problem.\n\n4. The order that we pick $x \\in N_p$ may affect the final set of $U_n$. Thus, a sequential approach to augment the dataset is not optimal. Could the authors devise a holistic method that takes a given graph, and add a minimal number of additional nodes such that the graph becomes connected?"

FACE's design assumes that the distance between steps is manageable for end-users, yet it fails to find recourse if this distance exceeds a specified threshold. In response, the authors propose augmenting the training data with artificial samples to bridge gaps between sparse regions in the input space, enhancing the likelihood of finding recourse. They also introduce a mechanism to learn a suitable distance function and threshold parameter, controlling the step margin in the recourse path. However, some theoretical aspects and practical relevance of the proposed method remain unclear."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Privacy Concerns with FACE as a Basis**: Using FACE as the foundational algorithm raises significant privacy concerns, as the method inherently relies on traversing data points from other users, which exposes sensitive information of other unsuspecting users. This risk, highlighted in recent studies (e.g., [1]), casts doubt on the real-world applicability of FACE-based recourse due to its clear privacy violations.\n\n- **Limited Evaluation Scope**: The empirical evaluation lacks breadth and depth. The comparison is limited to two other recourse algorithms, neglecting the diverse set of algorithms in the CARLA library [2] that could provide a more thorough assessment of the proposed method's effectiveness. For example, any gradient based algorithm can be return a recourse path. Hence, the algorithms in [2] serve as natural baselines for comparison. Additionally, the core evaluation is restricted to a logistic regression model. Since the authors claim the method is model-agnostic, it would be valuable to test all datasets on other model types, such as neural networks and tree-based classifiers, to validate its general applicability.\n\n- **Inadequate Handling of Categorical Variables**: The paper does not sufficiently address how categorical variables are managed, which is crucial in tabular datasets where they are common. Without clarification, it remains unclear whether the proposed approach is suited for real-world applications that often involve categorical features.\n\n- **Not Useful and Disconnected Theoretical Contributions**: The theoretical results in Section 3 are not well-integrated with the empirical findings. While they cover basic insights, such as bounding the VC dimension of a specific hypothesis class, these insights don\u2019t directly support the method's empirical performance. Additionally, the feasibility learning appears overly complex without practical benefits, especially given the lack of efficient algorithms for managing a large set of parameterized distance functions. Fruther, the paper does not provide theoretical guarantees that the synthetic data augmentation will remain within the data manifold. Such guarantees are necessary to ensure that the generated samples represent realistic and plausible data points, enhancing the method's reliability and applicability.\n\n-----\n**References**\n\n[1] Pawelczyk et al (2023), On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse, AISTATS 2023, https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05427\n\n[2]  Pawelczyk et al (2021), Carla: a python library to benchmark algorithmic recourse and counterfactual explanation algorithms, NeurIPS 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00783"
