    "abstract": "Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying the uncertainty of a predictive model; these algorithms modify the model to output sets of labels that are guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. However, existing conformal prediction algorithms have largely targeted classification and regression settings, where the structure of the prediction set has a simple form as a level set of the scoring function. However, for complex structured outputs such as text generation, these prediction sets might include a large number of labels and therefore be hard for users to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework for conformal prediction in the structured prediction setting, that modifies existing conformal prediction algorithms to output structured prediction sets that implicitly represent sets of labels. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach can be applied in domains where the prediction sets can be represented as a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph; for instance, for hierarchical labels such as image classification, a prediction set might be a small subset of coarse labels implicitly representing the prediction set of all their more fine-descendants. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used to construct prediction sets that satisfy a desired coverage guarantee in several domains.",

The proposed framework outputs structured prediction sets that achieve marginal or PAC coverage guarantees while minimizing prediction set size. In the context of a set of nodes in a directed acyclic graph, the prediction set as a small subset of coarse labels corresponds to the prediction set of fine-grained descendants of the coarse labels. The paper presents empirical analysis of the approach in three domains to demonstrate the performance of their approach."

[1] considers hierarchical image classification in ImageNet similar to the paper and controls the graph distance between nodes. Additionally, RAPS method in [2] is a conformal prediction method that introduces regularization to encourage smaller and stable sets, and is worth comparing to given the focus of the paper on reducing average set size.\n2. The empirical evaluation can certainly benefit from more analysis. In the current form, the contribution and significance of the method are not demonstrated very clearly:\n    - It is hard to understand the utility of the method without comparison with more baselines. I believe doing this is especially possible for the marginal guarantees. Qualitative comparison of the prediction sets will also help demonstrate the utility of structured prediction sets. I see the paper discusses one example in the main text, however there is certainly value in adding more examples in this case (also mentioning the error level used for standard conformal prediction and other details for fair comparison).\n    - Following from above, I appreciate Table 1 in the paper as it helps understand the influence of hyperparameters better. I would suggest adding similar examples for other datasets as well.\n\n3. The motivation of the paper is not very clear in the beginning and only becomes clearer as the method and examples are discussed later in the paper. While the introduction has sufficient details about the method, I would suggest making the motivation for structured prediction sets clearer early on.\n\n\n\n\n**Minor comments:**\n1.

                "value": "1. While the paper\u2019s application of conformal prediction to structured outputs is valuable, similar approaches have been explored in hierarchical classification and structured prediction. For instance, previous works have used hierarchical structures (e.g., DAGs or trees) to improve interpretability in label prediction. The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison to these existing methods, as well as a deeper explanation of what sets its approach apart. Highlighting any unique technical advancements in how the proposed framework constructs prediction sets in hierarchical settings (e.g., advantages of the DAG-based approach) would further clarify its contributions.\n\nSet-Valued Prediction in Hierarchical Classification with Constrained\nRepresentation Complexity. Mortier et al. (2022): This work focuses on hierarchical classification with constrained set-valued predictions, utilizing hierarchical label spaces in which classes are structured in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) or tree. It emphasizes creating interpretable predictions that adhere to hierarchical constraints, much like structured conformal prediction but without formal coverage guarantees.\n\n\n2. The experiments are limited to specific domains (MNIST digits, ImageNet, and SQuAD). Although these domains represent a variety of structured prediction tasks, they are relatively controlled environments and may not fully reflect the challenges of deploying conformal structured prediction in more complex real-world applications. For instance, the framework\u2019s performance on prediction sets for multi-label classification or in contexts with high label ambiguity (e.g., complex multi-class categorization in medical or legal documents) remains untested.\n\nDeploying conformal structured prediction in a healthcare setting, particularly for diagnostic tasks with hierarchical or multi-label structures (e.g., identifying conditions or diseases from imaging data or lab results), would offer insights into the model's reliability and interpretability under more variable, high-stakes conditions. This field often requires nuanced coverage guarantees and interpretability to support clinical decision-making.\n\nReal-world document classification often involves hierarchical categories (e.g., legal documents, financial reports) and multi-label classifications. Testing in this setting could reveal how well the model scales with complex, unbalanced label hierarchies, providing additional insights into its generalizability to larger, noisy datasets that are typical in business and legal contexts.\n\n3. The paper assumes that the label hierarchy can be represented by a DAG, which works well for hierarchical classification but may be restrictive for tasks with overlapping or cyclical dependencies. In complex scenarios where relationships between classes are non-hierarchical or not acyclic, this assumption may not hold, potentially limiting the framework\u2019s applicability to structured outputs with more intricate dependencies.\n\n4. The inclusion of PAC guarantees is a strong point, but the differences between the marginal and PAC guarantees could be better explored. The PAC guarantee is inherently conservative, and the experiments demonstrate that it leads to larger prediction sets in some cases. However, there is little analysis of scenarios where a PAC guarantee might be more beneficial than a marginal guarantee, or vice versa, depending on the task or risk tolerance."
