    "title": "A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Commuting Origin-Destination Flow Generation",
    "abstract": "Commuting Origin-Destination~(OD) flows are critical inputs for urban planning and transportation, providing crucial information about the population residing in one region and working in another within an interested area. Due to the high cost of data collection, researchers have developed physical and computational models to generate commuting OD flows using readily available urban attributes, such as sociodemographics and points of interest, for cities lacking historical OD flows \\textemdash commuting OD flow generation. Existing works developed models based on different techniques and achieved improvement on different datasets with different evaluation metrics, which hinderes establishing a unified standard for comparing model performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset containing commuting OD flows for 3,333 areas including a wide range of urban environments around the United States. Based on that, we benchmark widely used models for commuting OD flow generation. We surprisingly find that the network-based generative models achieve the optimal performance in terms of both precision and generalization ability, which may inspire new research directions of graph generative modeling in this field. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CommutingODGen-Dataset-0D4C/.",

Understanding the reasons behind their success could offer valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers.\n\n2. **Insufficient Exploration of Edge Cases**: The paper would benefit from a more in-depth analysis of how the models perform in extreme or atypical urban environments within the dataset. This could reveal potential limitations or areas for improvement.\n\n3. **Lack of Discussion on Model Fairness and Bias**: Given the diverse nature of the dataset, an analysis of potential biases in the models' predictions across different urban environments (e.g., rural vs. urban, high-income vs. low-income areas) would be beneficial.\n\n4. **Basic Benchmark Methods**: Many of the selected benchmark methods are too basic. The paper should include more advanced models based on transformers and diffusion, such as those discussed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04453) and [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15398).\n\n5. **Questionable Significance of Claims**: Are the claims regarding the significance of the research truly justified? Without this dataset, researchers in the field might only need about a week to conduct their own benchmarks.
