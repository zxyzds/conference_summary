    "abstract": "Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design aims to optimize a material distribution, e.g., metals over a printed circuit board, which is crucial for antenna and meta-material. This task, however, is inherently a highly non-convex problem with no explicit objective function, making it extremely challenging to solve. The most common approach to addressing this problem relies on evolutionary algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithm), where candidate structures are evaluated through electromagnetic simulation using specialized software. However, these methods struggle with inefficiency, especially when dealing with large structural design space and time-consuming simulations. \nTo address this, we propose a Deep Progressive Search method called DPS, which leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN) as a surrogate model to identify a satisfactory structure within a limited simulation budget. Specifically, we develop a tree-search-based design space control strategy that models the design space as a tree and incrementally refines it through node expansions, enabling adaptive exploration of more complex regions while leveraging insights from simpler subspaces. Moreover, we introduce a consistency-based sample selection strategy to balance exploration and exploitation. Experiments on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna show the effectiveness of the proposed DPS in terms of efficiency under limited evaluation budgets.",

It would be valuable for the authors to provide their rationale for selecting these specific grid sizes. Additionally, a discussion on how different grid sizes may affect the method's performance and efficiency would enhance the clarity of these experimental decisions.\n\n- To evaluate the method\u2019s scalability, an ablation study on higher-dimensional optimization problems would be insightful. Conducting experiments with progressively larger grid sizes or more intricate design problem would help demonstrate the scalability of DPS in practical, high-dimensional settings. This would offer concrete evidence of the method\u2019s robustness and scalability under varied problem complexities.\n\n- Given the shared focus on design optimization, comparing DPS with GenCO within the context of inverse design problems would be valuable. GenCO also proposes an optimization framework and has been evaluated on the inverse photonic design problem, which closely aligns with DPS's focus. A comparative analysis could highlight DPS\u2019s unique strengths and limitations, providing a clearer assessment of its performance relative to GenCO.\n\nFerber, A.

                "value": "1.The description of DPS is unclear and lacks details:\n* On page 7, lines 324-331, the details of Depth-wise Importance Assignment are missing. Specifically, only Equation 7 is given without further explanations, making it difficult for readers to understand how this importance assignment is implemented. Please add more details about it, such as providing a step-by-step explanation of how this assignment is implemented, including any algorithms or pseudocode if applicable.\n* When compared with the traditional design matrix, although the proposed Quadtree is more efficient in representing designs, the initial states of Quadtrees are less diverse than design matrices. When using traditional matrices, the initial design matrices can be complex designs, making all candidate designs have equal probabilities to be reached in a limited number of iterations. In comparison, the initial Quadtrees are definitely very simple designs (all states =1 or all states =0). Therefore, for a Quadtree, simple designs have significantly greater chances of being searched than complex designs, especially when maximum iteration $M$ is small. Please provide a discussion or analysis to show that complex designs are adequately explored within $M$ iterations. Alternatively, please provide guidelines on setting $M$ to ensure complex designs are adequately explored.\n* On page 4, Algorithm 2, the tree search of the design space is implemented by either resampling a leaf node\u2019s state or splitting a leaf node into four child nodes. But details are not provided in the corresponding paragraph (page 6, lines 317-323). What is the probability of resampling or splitting? \n* On page7, it is unclear how Equation 8 can be used to measure the consistency of ordering results. Are both $x_i$ terms in the equation from time point $t$? More explanations should be provided.\n* Some experimental setups of DPS are not explained, such as maximum iteration $M$, $K$ in top-$K$ list, and total number of samples $M$ in CSS.\n\n2.The experiments are not solid:\n* The experimental setup does not specify the number of runs conducted. Are the results reported in Table 3 obtained from only one run (As no standard deviations are reported in Table 3)? Considering the stochastic processes in DPS and the comparison algorithms, the authors should conduct many runs (e.g. 20 or more) for experiments to ensure the reliability of the results. In addition, the authors should report mean performance and standard deviations in Table 3, and perform appropriate statistical tests to demonstrate that DPS significantly outperforms the comparison algorithms.\n* Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have been widely used to solve expensive optimization problems; however, the authors did not compare BO in their experiments and did not explain why it was not considered. Please consider the following options: 1). Include a comparison with a recently proposed BO method in the experiments; 2). Provide a clear explanation for why BO was not considered, discussing any potential limitations or challenges in applying BO to this specific EMS problem.\n* Some comparison methods are obsolete. For example, surrogate-GA was proposed decades ago [1]. Although the authors cited a paper published in 2020, the main contribution of this publication was the application of surrogate-GA to special design problems, rather than the development of a novel optimization method. I suggest considering some newly proposed optimization algorithms as comparison methods. \n* The comparison experiment in Table 3 is not fair. Some comparison methods, such as DPS and surrogate-GA, have their predictors updated during the optimization, while the predictors in other comparison methods, such as surrogate-assisted RS and invGrad, are trained on offline datasets. Consider running additional fair experiments where all predictors in comparison methods are updated during the optimization. \n\n3. On page 6, Equation 3, there is no explanation about $i$ and $j$ until line 290. Please consider revising the relevant paragraphs to avoid potential confusion.  \nIn addition, some denotations are not consistent throughout the submission. For example, $M$ is the maximum number of iterations on page 4, Algorithm 2, but $M$ is also the number of samples on page 7, Equation 9. $t$ is the time point on page 7, Equation 8, but $t$ is also used to represent frequency in GHz on page 15, line 795 (Appendix A).\n\n4. On page 4, line 204, the optimization problem is formulated with a predictor. However, when the predictor is fitted with limited training data, it is very likely that the optimum found by the predictor is not optimal in simulations. As mentioned in line 210, further validation with high-fidelity simulations is required. Therefore, Equation 2 could be a step in the EMS, but it is inappropriate to formulate the entire EMS problem as Equation 2.\n\n5. Some minor issues:\n* In Table 3, the agg obj results of cGAN and cVAE for High-Gain Antenna are incorrect. They should be minimum instead of maximum.\n* There are some typos, such as:\n    1) On page 10, line 492, 'ESS' should be \u2018CSS\u2019.\n    2) On page 15, line 792, 'minimize the maximum' should be 'minimize the minimum\u2019. \n* Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as 'a expanded' should be 'an expanded.'\"\n\n[1] Lim, Dudy, et al. \"Generalizing surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation.\"\u00a0IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation\u00a014.3 (2009): 329-355."
