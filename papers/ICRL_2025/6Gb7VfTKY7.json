    "title": "Parallel simulation for sampling under isoperimetry and score-based diffusion models",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in proving discretization bounds for sampling under isoperimetry and for diffusion models. As data size grows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the great success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in scientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks.  Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better dependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity  (i.e., reduced from $O(\\mathrm{poly}(\\log d))$ to $O(\\log d)$), which is even optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration complexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods in scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a parallel Picard method aimed at enhancing the efficiency of sampling under conditions of isoperimetry and score-based diffusion models (SGMs). It addresses two primary sampling problems: sampling from log-concave distributions and sampling for SGMs used in generative modeling. The method presents improvements in iteration complexity from $O(poly(\\\\log d))$ to $O(\\\\log d)$ which aligns with known theoretical lower bounds. By leveraging parallelization techniques across both time slices and within Picard iterations, the authors propose a discretization scheme that could potentially reduce the computational burden associated with sampling, especially for large-scale datasets."

The diagonal-style parallelization across time slices sounds fresh to me, which addresses limitations in convergence faced by existing methods that do not fully parallelize time slices.\n\n3. The paper provides rigorous theoretical bounds, such as convergence rates with respect to KL divergence. The approach's complexity analysis indicates a substantial improvement over previous methods, achieving nearly optimal bounds in iteration complexity.\n\n4. By adapting the approach for diffusion models and incorporating techniques like shrinking step sizes, the paper shows versatility and application potential across a range of generative modeling tasks."

Regarding the sub-optimal space complexity resulting from the application to overdamped Langevin diffusion, could the authors clarify what hinders the analysis of their methods in the context of underdamped Langevin diffusion?\n\n2. Considering that the authors demonstrate improved iteration complexity at the expense of slightly increased space complexity, a detailed cost-related analysis would be beneficial to more thoroughly discuss the trade-offs. Specifically, evaluating computational time and memory usage under the utility maximization problem could demonstrate how these factors affect performance in practical scenarios, which might inform the method's applicability in resource-limited environments.\n\nMiscellany: In L.3 of Algorithm 1, the subscript should be written as $B\\_{nh + mh/M}$ to avoid confusion."

                "value": "[1] There are no empirical evaluations of the proposed method. Diffusion models work with dimension $d \\sim 10^4$. Providing an algorithm which requires $d/\\epsilon^2 \\log (d/epsilon^2)$ parallel threads with $\\log(d/epsilon^2)$ iterations instead of $d/epsilon^2$ parallel threads with $\\log^2(d/\\epsilon^2)$ iterations seems ineffective/ vacuous since such a degree of parallelism cannot be achieved in the first place. Therefore, the relative merit of the currently proposed algorithm has to be established empirically in practical settings. It would help the case made by the paper if suitable empirical evaluations are included.\n\n[2] Since the algorithmic modification proposed in the work is straightforward, and there are no empirical evaluations, the main technical contribution of the paper is the proof. The paper has very little exposition of proof techniques. It would be helpful to add a deeper discussion of this.\n\n[3] The tables 1 and 2 can be improved by stating the exact polylog factors of $d$ in prior works. This is important since the main improvement claimed in the manuscript is the improvement in these factors. I found the comparison to underdamped Langevin dynamics presented together with the results for Overdamped Langevin dynamics in Table 1 very confusing. Consider splitting these comparisons or making it more clear. Similarly, comparison of SDE based methods to ODE based methods in Table 2 is also confusing."
