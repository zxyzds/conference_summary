    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the ergodic convergence properties of the Peaceman-Rachford (PR) method with semi-proximal terms for solving convex optimization problems (COPs). By reformulating the PR method as a degenerate proximal point method, for the first time we establish the global convergence of the ergodic sequence generated by the PR method with broadly chosen semi-proximal terms under the assumption that there exists a  Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) solution to the COPs. This result represents a significant departure from previous studies on the non-ergodic convergence of the PR method, which typically requires strong convexity (or strong monotonicity in the reformulated operator) conditions that are hardly satisfied for COPs. Moreover, we establish an ergodic iteration complexity of $O(1/k)$ of the PR method with semi-proximal terms, measured by the objective error, the feasibility violation, and the KKT  residual using the $\\varepsilon$-subdifferential. Based on these convergence properties, we introduce the solver EPR-LP, using the ergodic sequence of the PR method with semi-proximal terms for solving linear programming (LP) problems. EPR-LP incorporates an adaptive restart strategy and dynamic penalty parameter updates for efficiency and robustness. Extensive numerical experiments on LP benchmark datasets, executed on a high-performance GPU, show that our Julia-based solver outperforms the award-winning solver PDLP at a tolerance level of $10^{-8}$.",

The algorithm design and key techniques, such as the restart strategy and dynamic penalty parameter updates, were previously developed in Chen et al. (2024) and Sun et al. (2024). Additionally, the proof for the ergodic version builds on the degenerate PPM framework from Bredies et al. (2022). From a technical standpoint, achieving non-ergodic convergence is generally more challenging than ergodic convergence. The paper would be more compelling if it explored additional structural properties of LPs when using the ergodic average. Nevertheless, the numerical experiments already show some advantages when applying this approach in a straightforward manner."

In general comparison between ergodic and non-ergodic convergence, taking averages can compromise some desirable properties. For this specific LP task, it would be valuable to see how the computational performance for the ergodic sequence compares, providing a clearer picture of its practical implications and insights."

Their key approach is to reformulate pADMM as an equivalent degenerate proximal point method (dPPM) and analyze its convergence using the tool of enlargements of monotone operators. Following this approach, they establish an ergodic convergence rate of $O(1/k)$ for pADMM in terms of objective error, feasibility violation, and the KKT residual. They also implemented the PR method with an ergodic sequence, incorporating an adaptive restart strategy and dynamic penalty parameter updates, for solving large-scale linear programming problems. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance over the award-winning cuPDLP solver."

                "value": "- My primary concern is the high similarity between this submission and the work by Chen et al. (2024), which the authors also cited in the introduction. Both papers examine pADMM-type methods with semi-proximal terms and reformulate them as a degenerate PPM method to analyze convergence. The main difference appears to be that the current submission omits the additional Halpern iteration used in Chen et al. (2024), which intuitively would simplify the analysis rather than add novel insights. Furthermore, I recommend including HPR-LP in the numerical experiments as a baseline for comparison. As it stands, the unique contribution of this paper remains unclear. \n- The paper also lacks a discussion of relevant studies on the convergence of the PR method. For example, Monteiro and Sim (2018) established similar ergodic convergence rates of $O(1/k)$ for the PR method using $\\epsilon$-enlargements of monotone operators. A detailed discussion of how the current result differs from prior work, such as that of Monteiro and Sim, is necessary.\n\n\n----\n\nKaihuang Chen, Defeng Sun, Yancheng Yuan, Guojun Zhang, and Xinyuan Zhao. \"HPR- LP: An implementation of an HPR method for solving linear programming.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.12179, 2024.\n\nRenato DC Monteiro and Chee-Khian Sim. \"Complexity of the relaxed Peaceman\u2013Rachford splitting method for the sum of two maximal strongly monotone operators.\" Computational Optimization and Applications 70 (2018): 763-790."

                "value": "Overall, I believe the contribution is publishable, and the motivation is plausible. My comments are as follows.\n\n* The proposed EPR-LP uses restart and dynamic penalty tuning. Are these heuristics covered in the convergence analysis?\n\n* In Line 1 of Algorithm 1, compared with Algorithm 2, the variable $z^0$ may not be in the effective domain of the augmented Lagrangian. Could this cause issues for the algorithm, especially when rho is close to one?\n\n* In the paragraph starting on Line 066, the authors mention that without the preconditioner and with $\\rho=2$, Algorithm 1 is equivalent to GADMM induced by the PR method. Is this GADMM related to the GADMM of Davis-Yin in Table 2? If so, and if I understand correctly, as shown by the fourth line in Table 2, the ergodic convergence rate for the rho=2 case has already been established in Davis-Yin. I suggest the authors elaborate on the subtle differences between the algorithms referenced in Table 2, as it could be confusing to readers which cases are not covered in the literature and are introduced for the first time in this paper.\n\n* Compared with other non-ergodic results in Table 2, why is the non-ergodic analysis in Appendix B only of Big-O type rather than small-o?\n\n* For the figures in Section 4, what is the definition of the horizontal axis? I think it would be helpful to provide more details on the rationale for this choice.\n\n* Regarding the third bullet on Line 454, I don\u2019t think this observation is very meaningful. First, the bounds given in (13) and (14) represent worst-case behavior, which could be far from the actual data distribution in real-world datasets. Second, it appears that methods EPR-LP and EDR-LP use heuristic techniques, such as restart and penalty tuning, to improve numerical performance, which may not be reflected in (13) and (14).\n\n\nMinor:\n* The meaning of the abbreviation EPR-LP should be explained early before frequently used. Indeed, the first appearance of EPR-LP is at the abstract but only formally defined on Line 330 in page 7.\n\n* The notation $A$ is defined as a matrix in Line 043, but could be used as a linear operator in, e.g., Line 075. This is not actually a problem, but making the terminology consistent would be preferable.\n\n* Algorithm 2 appears two pages before its formal definition.\n\n* Line 379: \"Since\" should be \"since\""
