    "title": "The Power of Data: How LSTMs Outshine Disease Progression Modeling with Two Simple Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Much of prior efforts have focused on Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs, however, present significant challenges for deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Variational Recurrent Neural Networks (VRNN), and Transformer due to the inherent complexities and variabilities within the data. Effectively addressing these variabilities is crucial for improving the performance and interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose two mechanisms to tackle key variabilities in EHR data: a \"bi-directional\" mechanism to account for the need to infer the underlying physical state in both forward and backward directions, and a \"time-aware\" mechanism to address irregular time intervals between consecutive events. We theoretically validate and empirically evaluate the impact of these two mechanisms across three state-of-the-art deep learning models in three distinct healthcare systems. Our results showed that the influence of the two mechanisms\u2014bidirectionality and time-awareness\u2014surpasses the differences between specific deep learning models. Across all three models, the performance hierarchy consistently follows: Bidirectional & Time-Aware > Time-Aware > Bidirectional > Original model, across all three healthcare systems. Notably, the Bidirectional Time-Aware LSTM matches or exceeds the performance of the corresponding VRNN and Transformer models in every system tested.",

                "value": "1. Lack of Novelty and Incomplete Related Work Analysis: \n\nThe paper's primary mechanisms\u2014bidirectional encoding and time delta embedding\u2014have been previously explored in the context of EHR data modeling. For instance, T-LSTM [1] effectively uses a time decay function to model time gaps, while HiTANet [2] integrates adaptive time embeddings into the transformer framework for EHR sequence encoding. In fact, the authors already mention the T-LSTM in the related works but fail to realize the proposed idea is highly similar to the paper and fail to provide any comparison or illustration. To strengthen the claim of novelty, I suggest the authors conduct a more thorough review of related works and explicitly outline how their proposed approach differs from or improves upon these prior methods. Including later and related advancements would clarify the unique contributions of this paper and address overlaps with existing research.\n\n2. Insufficient Experiment Details: \n\nWhile the comparison across different neural architectures is commendable, the paper lacks specific details about model configurations, which are crucial given the typically limited size of EHR datasets. Model parameter size and the number of layers can significantly impact performance, particularly for complex models such as transformers. To enhance the reproducibility and reliability of results, I recommend the authors include detailed information on the parameter sizes, layer configurations, and training strategies of each model tested. This would provide a clearer understanding of how resource constraints might have influenced the observed outcomes and support fair comparisons across models.\n\n\nRef\n1.

                "value": "The paper addresses Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It particularly focuses on a deadly phenotype, namely septic shock, which is a critical condition causing high mortality in ICU patients. The study proposes solutions for two key challenges in longitudinal EHR modeling: irregular sampling and the presence of subtle symptoms. To address these, it proposes time-varying embedding and bidirectional context modeling. As a result, these mechanisms could handle the irregular sampling of events and model both historical and future information to improve prediction performance. Because these techniques are generalizable to unidirectional deep learning models, like RNN and Transformer, the authors validate the different combinations of unidirectional models, time-varying mechanism, and bidirectional modeling. The results demonstrate the improvements of these techniques and the potential for future research. Given my past research in sepsis prediction from ICU data, I believe this research addresses a key challenge and  could have significant impact. The inclusion of bidirectional contexts and time-varying information is reasonable for improving model accuracy.\n\nAlthough the paper presents a well-motivated solution with impactful potential applications in AI for healthcare, it has two crucial limitations that prevent its acceptance. The first main limitation is the poor presentation of technical contributions. It does not clearly distinguish the existing knowledge about RNN/Transformer, and it does not display techinical noveltiy. The second main limitation is that its technical development lags behind research advancements in Linear Transformer, exponential decay, and relative position embedding. These limitations impact the paper's technical contribution.\n\nOverall, this research has strong practical applications in real-world healthcare but could benefit from **better presentation** and **the inclusion of advanced techniques in Related Works**. If the authors address these weaknesses, I would consider adjusting my evaluation."

This study discusses potential solutions based on the motivation as well as the challenges. The proposed bidirectional and time-aware approaches are reasonable ways to address key limitations.\n\n4. The authors clearly explain why the proposed bidirectional and time-aware mechanisms improve model performance over original unidirectional models. \n\n5. One insightful component of this paper is the use of VRNN with time-varying mechanisms incorporated into the latent distribution. This approach emphasizes the sensitivity of VRNN to variable time intervals, which may potentially better reflect temporal dynamics and capture subtle variations in health data.\n\n6. A reliable aspect of this study is the identification of gold standard labels for septic shock, a factor often neglected in favor of simple ICD codes.\n\n7. The experiments leverage a large, multi-institutional ICU dataset. Given the limited access to healthcare data in research, this is an important advantage compared to other studies."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The paper incorrectly uses the term \"forecasting\",  whereas the experiment focuses on septic shock prediction (i.e., classification). \n\n\n2. The descriptions of LSTM and bi-LSTM in Section 2 should be merged into a background section. Because they are not technical contributions in this paper. Doing so, it could clearly distinguish the exsting works from the proposed contributions. \n\n\n3. Section 2 is too complex and nested, where its content could be more concise. For example, Section 2.1 dicusses time-varying embedding in LSTM. However, there is no need for 2.1.1, as the LSTM should be discussed in background as existing research. Moreover, the content in Section 2.1.1 could be simplified significantly. You can first describe the exponential decay function $ \\gamma(\\Delta \\tilde{t}) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\Delta \\tilde{t})$ and the exponential decayed hidden states $h^{t-1} \\cdot \\gamma(\\Delta \\tilde{t})$. Therefore, this paper does not need to include equations of each LSTM gate (Forget Gate, Input Gate, Cell State Update, Output Gate) using the decay function. \n\n\n4. Some valuable technical details are currently located in the appendix. For example, the discussion of how to incorporate time-varying mechanism in RNN in appendix A should be moved to the main text. I believe A.5 is particularly important, it has not been discussed before, but is not currently presented in the main text. \n\n\n5. Some valuable technical discussions are missing. For example, there is no discussion of the learnable decay rate $\\alpha$. Explaining its technical meaning and clinical insights (i.e., the connection between decay rate and chronic disease) could add values to this study. Some experiments could be done to support it. \n\n6.  This study may not familiar with the recent technical advancements in relative position embedding (RPE). For example, the time-varying embedding $e^t = E_t(\\Delta \\tilde{t})$ is a variant of RPE. In Rotary PE (RoPE) [1],  $Q_n^\\top K_m = W_Q^\\top X_n^\\top  e^{-i \\theta (n - m)} X_m W_K$, we can treat $\\Delta \\tilde{t} = n - m$ to make RoPE time-varying. \n\n\n    Some existing works have discussed the connection between the proposed time-varying embedding and RPE [2]. **The authors should discuss the connection to RPE (RoPE, xPos) in the Related Work section** [1,3].\n\n    [1] RoFormer: Enhanced transformer with Rotary Position Embedding.

ACL 2020. \n\n7. This study misses the important connection of the proposed exponential decay mechanism and linear Transformer [2]. The linear Transformer rewrites Attention as Linear Attention, which is a Linear RNN model with a state variable. Among Linear Transformers, RWKV and RetNet apply exponential decay to the state variables [3,4]. For example, given the exponential decayed state variables in Retnet ($S_n = \\gamma S_{n-1} + K_n^\\top V_n$) and yours $h^{t-1} \\cdot\\exp(-\\alpha \\Delta \\tilde{t})$, we can see a clear connection.\n\n    **Therefore, a discussion of Linear Transformers in Related Works should be included**. Given the connection to RPE as well as Linear Transformer, some works with RPE and Linear Attention are actually your proposed BI-T-Transformer model [6], which could be included into Related Work. \n\n    [4] Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention.

The paper would benefit from more qualitative analysis. For example, this study mentions septic shock has subtle symptoms in the early stage and the bidirectionality could improve prediction performance. Therefore, it could include a trajectory analysis in a subject that shows the subtle symptoms as well as its impact on labels. Other qualitative analysis and clinical analysis are encouraged. \n\n\n10. Regarding Transformer, the experiment designs are not adequate. The Transformer includes unidirectional attention (causal attention from Transformer's decoder or GPT) and bidirectional attention (standard self-attention from Transformer's encoder or BERT). Therefore, **decoder-only GPT should be your baseline, BERT should be your bidirectional Transformer**. \n\n\n    However, this paper introduces a forward and backward self-attention, and then concatenates them together as final representation. This approach is very similar to ELMO paper [6]. However, the BERT paper discusses this difference, showing that the standard self-attention mechanism inherently models both forward and backward context. Consequently, I think the authors should re-conduct the experiments with GPT and BERT. \n\n    [8] Deep contextualized word representations.

The Transformer architecture\u2019s inherent bidirectionality, achieved through QKV calculations that allow attention across all tokens, enhances this approach. Additionally, Hitanet accounts for irregular time intervals, as do other methods, such as T-ContextGGAN [4], which also models irregular time intervals using Transformer-based structures.
