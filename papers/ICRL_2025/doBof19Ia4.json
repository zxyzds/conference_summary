    "title": "GeoRDe: Tertiary Structure-based RNA Design With Multiple Geometric Constraint",
    "abstract": "Functional RNA sequence design plays an essential role in the regulation of life processes. The RNA inverse folding problem, which involves designing nucleic acid sequences based on their three-dimensional structures, remains highly challenging. This complexity arises not only from the inherent flexibility of RNA structures but also from the base-pairing rules that impose critical spatial constraints on the RNA scaffold. In recent times, the design of RNA has often depended on geometric graph networks to design sequences. Motivated by recent advancements in protein design, we have developed the RNAformer module. This module is capable of learning the geometric constraints of RNA molecules in cooperation with geometric graph networks. Furthermore, to enhance the specificity of sequence generation, we have integrated secondary structure information as labels, ensuring that the designed sequences align more closely with secondary structure constraints. Additionally, we have used RNA language models to understand average evolutionary constraints. By incorporating a range of constraint insights, GeoRDe has demonstrated superior performance under identical training data conditions and has also showcased generalization capabilities on the independent casp15 and RNA-puzzle datasets. Through extensive experimentation, the GeoRDe has proven to be an innovative solution to the challenges of RNA design.",

In fact, a lot of places in this paper felt like it was written by AI. For example, in line 161-162, \"... their relative contact distances are harnessed as pair features to enhance the characterization of the local environment surrounding each atom.\". I have never seen anyone working in this field (RNA, ML) ever wrote something like this. It just feels so off.\n- inconsistent naming.

So, it may be better to discuss these two methods separately.\n- Why would you ever put evaluation metrics before the actual methodology? It is so strange.\n- How meaningful are the included LLM embeddings, in particular on RNA aptamers with no apparent sequence evolution? From your ablation results on Table 4, it seems the LLM improvement is neglible."

                "value": "Overall this submission has substantial shortcomings in the categories of scientific writing and presentation, study design and scientific rigour, result presentation and soundness of conclusion as well as originality. I won't list all details, but I encourage the authors to review their work in light of each category. I will provide examples for each. \nScientific writing and presentation:\n1. Please adhere to the citation style of ICLR, the author name is within the text and it makes it hard to read. \n2. Please make use of more figures that explain the architecture, e.g. Figure 1 appears very late in the text and is sparsely referred too. \n3. Organisation: The introduction and related work are a little repetitive and overblown. I'd prefer more preciseness and instead more focus on a background section that introduces for example AlphaFold 2's evoformer in mathematical detail. \n4. There is a mix of writing styles: $.3.1 uses pseudocode, 3.4.2 uses a different style of pseudo-code in text. Generally a lot of notations vary, in the introduction sequence length is denoted as \"N\", later in the manuscript it becomes \"seq_len\". I would advise to not use pseud-code in text and rather use mathematical description of the operations, e.g. in line 268 \" message(...) -> update\" -- what does that mean?\n\nStudy design and scientific rigour:\n1. Several choices are not well explained or motivated: \na) Choice nucleic acid back-bone reference. The authors chose C4', C1' and N1/N9 atoms without any reference. To my knowledge, the canonical RNA back-bone definition is defined by the phosphate bond between C3' and C5' atoms. The RNA-TM score is also defined on the C3': https://zhanggroup.org/papers/2019_24.pdf .  \nb) How can we assure that the combination of C4', C1' and N1/N9 angles does not leak the nucleotide identity? How was the nearest neighbour area of 12 Angstrom defined -- is there a reference or an ablations study?\nc) It looks like rmsd was calculated between forward folded predicted sequence and ground truth structure. This disregards the bias of the imperfect forward folding model. It should be the RMSD or TM-score between the forward folded ground truth sequence and predicted sequence\nd) the datasets are not well referenced, there is no information about size. \ne) where are the PIFOLD and other model's performance coming from? Did you retrain those models?\n\nResult presentation and soundness of conclusion:\n1. Please provide std deviations or some form of statistical boundary to assess significance of differences in the results in all presented tables\n2. Where do the values of all other models come from? Were they retrained on the same data?\n3. How was the train/test split performed?\n4. Sequence recovery on additional datasets: What is the overlap between CASP15 and your training data? Why are only the results from the gRNAde training presented? Why is there no training on both datasets (gRNAde and RDesign) presented on CASP15? \n5. Tertiary structure prediction: This feels a lot like cherry picking. No statistical results are presented, but \"we selected a series of RNA sequences designed by GeoRDe\" -- how were those three sequences selected? In line 430: \"predicted structures exhibited low RMSD\" -- what does \"low\" mean? Again, this needs a statistical result over more than three hand-picked samples. \n6. The Conclusion section reads a little overblown and I recommend the authors to tame down the claims a little bit \"Our approach has demonstrated significant advancements in the field of RNA sequence design\" or \"[...] positions it as a powerful tool for both research and therapeutics\". \nOriginality:\nIn section 4.4.1 it is claimed that SeqFormer is inspired by Jumper's work on protein design. This paper's algorithm 1 is a one-to-one copy of Jumper et al. Algorithm 6 in the AF2 supplementary (https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03819-2/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3819_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)"
