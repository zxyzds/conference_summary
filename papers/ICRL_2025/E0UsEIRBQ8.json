    "title": "Semi-Supervised Underwater Object Detection with Image Enhancement Guided by Attribute-based Data Distribution",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised underwater object detection aims to improve the performance of detectors on unlabeled underwater images by leveraging knowledge from labeled ones. However, existing methods often overlook the distribution differences between labeled and unlabeled underwater images. In this paper, we propose a novel underwater image enhancement method guided by attribute-based data distribution (UIEG+), which focuses on reducing the discrepancies between enhanced and original unlabeled images across different attributes, thereby effectively addressing the challenges in semi-supervised underwater object detection. Specifically, we explore an underwater image enhancement strategy based on two attributes: color and scale distributions. For the color attribute, we construct a 3-dimensional grid memory, where each grid cell represents a color subspace and records the number of samples in that subspace. Similarly, for the scale attribute, we design a 1-dimensional vector memory that dynamically stores the number of samples in each scale subspace. Subsequently, we propose an effective sampling method to derive parameters for color and scale transformations based on the aforementioned distribution analysis, increasing the likelihood of transformations in low-distribution regions. To evaluate its effetiveness and superiority, massive semi-superivised underwater object deteciton experiments in multiple datasets have been conduted by integrating UIEG+ into existing semi-supervised object detection frameworks. The code will be released.",

These approaches don\u2019t take specifically into account the unlabeled distribution, but process all images in a uniform way; hence, if there is a main color/scale mode in the distribution, it is the one that will be mostly represented by the state-of-the-art approaches. However, this seems to achieve the same result as what the authors are doing, i.e., explicitly select the mode of the distribution.\n\n2) Results lack confidence intervals or standard deviations, making it hard to assess the statistical significance of AP/mAP differences.\n\n3) Overall, the methodological novelty of the approach is limited. The whole framework follows an established paradigm, and the enhancement approach is really very simple (besides my notes in weakness 1)."

However, the solution is calculating the average colour/scale parameter from images and use it to augment training data. It may improve the performance, but it's trying to overfit the dataset. As the evaluation dataset is not a big dataset, overfitting may slightly improve the performance. The authors should prove the generalisation of this method. What if the evaluation data contains many objects in different colours and scales? Real underwater scenes are highly diverse, and the URPC data from the Zhangzi Island is heavily biased.\n\nThe performance is not good enough, for example, in Tab.1, Ours (PseCo) only improves the baseline by 0.4%.\n\nThus this paper does not meet ICLR's standards."
