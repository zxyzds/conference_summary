    "title": "Craftium: Creating Efficient Environments for Open-Ended and Embodied Agents Beyond Gridworlds",
    "abstract": "Advancements in open-ended and embodied AI require highly adaptable and computationally efficient environments. Yet, existing platforms often lack the flexibility, efficiency, or richness necessary to drive progress in these areas. Research in fields related to open-endedness, such as unsupervised environment design and continual reinforcement learning, usually defaults to simplistic 2D grid environments, as more complex alternatives are either too rigid or computationally expensive. Conversely, in embodied AI, the field relies on fully featured video games like Minecraft, which are rich in content but computationally inefficient and offer limited customization for creating new tasks. This paper introduces Craftium, a framework based on the open-source Minetest game engine, providing a highly customizable, easy-to-use, and efficient platform for building rich Minecraft-like 3D environments. We showcase environments of different complexity and nature: from simple reinforcement learning tasks to a vast world with many creatures and biomes, along with a customizable procedural task generator. Conducted benchmarks show that Craftium substantially improves the computational cost of Minecraft-based frameworks, achieving +2K steps per second more.",

Through various benchmark tests, the authors demonstrate that Craftium achieves significant performance gains, being notable faster than the Minecraft-based frameworks, and present use cases illustrating its flexibility for diverse RL tasks, procedural environment generation, and complex open-world simulations.\n\nMinor comments:\n- There is a typo on line 1027 \u201cThen, the agent that the agent, \u2026\u201d \n- This paper seems like relevant work: Grbic, Djordje, et al. \"Evocraft: A new challenge for open-endedness.\" Applications of Evolutionary Computation: 24th International Conference, EvoApplications 2021."

However, all the generated environments can be represented using ASCII, meaning they are 2D environments. What is shown is a 3D representation of a 2D environment.\n- In table 1, it is difficult to evaluate exactly if a framework is active or not after some time. There is no guarantee that this framework will still be active after a few months.
