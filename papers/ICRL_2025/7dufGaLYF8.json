    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students' future knowledge levels based on their historical interaction sequences. Most KT methods rely on interaction data between students and questions to assess knowledge states and these approaches typically assume that the interaction data is reliable. In fact, on the one hand, factors such as guessing or slipping could inevitably bring in noise in sequences. On the other hand, students' interaction sequences are often sparse, which could amplify the impact of noise, further affecting the accurate assessment of knowledge states. Although data augmentation which is always adopted in KT could alleviate data sparsity, it also brings noise again during the process. Therefore, denoising strategy is urgent and it should be employed not only on the original sequences but also on the augmented sequences. To achieve this goal, we adopt a plug and play denoising framework in our method. The denoising technique is adopted not only on the  original and the enhanced sequences separately during the data augmentation process, but also we explore the hard noise through the comparison between the two streams. During the denoising process, we employ a novel strategy for selecting data samples to balance the hard and soft noise leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This approach optimizes the ratio of explicit to implicit denoising and combines them to improve feature representation. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only enhances accuracy but also maintains model interpretability.",

For instance, HD-KT [1], a relevant method that also addresses denoising for guessing and slipping issues, is not discussed or compared, which limits the contextual understanding of the model's contributions. Additionally, more works in sequence denoising, as mentioned in the Related Work section, should be considered as baselines to better validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n- The main technical contribution of the paper is the use of SVD decomposition to analyze informative signals. However, this approach is relatively simple and has been applied in other fields. Additionally, the paper lacks a thorough discussion on computational overhead, particularly the time-intensive nature of SVD calculations, which could impact real-time feasibility in large-scale applications.\n\n- There are minor writing issues: Missing punctuation at the end of the formula; inconsistent of reference format and so on.\n\n[1] HD-KT: Advancing Robust Knowledge Tracing via Anomalous Learning Interaction Detection.

Since the singular vectors of the matrices before and after denoising differ, directly comparing the singular values seems questionable and may not provide a meaningful measure of the noise.\n\n2. The algorithm's performance is not convincing. Although the denoising-enhanced version of the algorithm shows some improvement in AUC and RMSE metrics compared to baselines, the gains are relatively modest. Additionally, the algorithm includes both explicit and implicit denoising mechanisms. However, as seen in Table 1, the performance of the SDAKT algorithm does not significantly differ from using only one of these denoising strategies. This suggests that the combination of both denoising approaches does not substantially enhance the overall performance. One of the key innovations of this paper is the fusion of explicit and implicit denoising strategies, yet the results indicate that this fusion does not demonstrate clear advantages in practice.\n\n3. Many writing and presentation problems: The paper suffers from inconsistencies in formatting and imprecise language. For example, in Equations (6) and (7), embedding vectors are inappropriately subjected to singular value decomposition, when matrix forms should have been used. Additionally, the citation format in line 196 is incorrect, and the reference formatting is inconsistent throughout the paper. Finally, there is a discrepancy between the description and Equation (4) in the text: while the description refers to the original sequences, the equations present denoised sequences instead."
