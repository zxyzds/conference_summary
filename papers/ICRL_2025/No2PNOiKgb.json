    "title": "Improved Convex Decomposition with Ensembling and Boolean Primitives",
    "abstract": "Describing a scene in terms of primitives -- geometrically simple shapes that offer a parsimonious but accurate abstraction of structure -- is an established and difficult fitting problem. Different scenes require different numbers of primitives, and these primitives interact strongly; however, any proposed solution can be evaluated at inference time. The state of the art method involves a learned regression procedure to predict a start point consisting of a fixed number of primitives, followed by a descent method to refine the geometry and remove redundant primitives. Methods are evaluated by accuracy in depth and normal prediction and in scene segmentation. This paper shows that very significant improvements in accuracy can be obtained by (a) incorporating a small number of \\emph{negative} primitives and (b) ensembling over a number of different regression procedures. Ensembling is by refining each predicted start point, then choosing the best by fitting loss. Extensive experiments on the standard NYUv2 dataset confirm that negative primitives are useful, and that our refine-then-choose strategy outperforms choose-then-refine, confirming that the fitting problem is very difficult. Our ensembling with boolean primitives approach strongly outperforms existing methods; additionally we present several improvements to the underlying primitive generation process enabling us to obtain better decompositions with fewer primitives. Code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.",

                "value": "This paper presents an approach for decomposing indoor scenes into convex primitives from a single RGBD image. It introduces two key strategies for convex decomposition: the ensembling process and the use of boolean primitives. The ensembling strategy involves employing multiple networks, each predicting a different number or type of primitives, and selecting the optimal primitive set based on refinement loss. The boolean primitives strategy utilizes constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations, allowing up to two negative primitives for subtraction, which enhances geometric accuracy by trimming unnecessary parts of positive primitives. Additionally, the paper proposes skills to improve fitting accuracy, such as biasing sample loss, annealing loss weights, and data augmentation. Experiments on the NYUv2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed strategies enhance geometric representation accuracy and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in depth estimation, normal prediction, and scene segmentation accuracy. While the method proposed in the paper enhances task performance, some design aspects remain somewhat puzzling and could be further improved."

The authors show examples demonstrating that boolean primitives are parameter-efficient for fitting certain geometric shapes. Additionally, the ensembling strategy is straightforward and easy to follow.\n3.The paper includes extensive ablation experiments to validate the contribution and performance improvement of each proposed module."

                "value": "1.The main contributions of this paper are ensembling predictions from multiple networks and introducing negative primitives. However, these strategies do not appear to yield consistent performance gains. In Table 1, the naive method '24/32/40' outperforms both 'Pos - S\u2192R' and 'Pos + Neg S\u2192R', suggesting that ensembling and negative primitives are not accurate enough to help candidate selection before refinement. Although 'Pos - R\u2192S' and 'Pos+Neg - R\u2192S' achieve better performance, this is likely due to the availability of more final results for selection, indicating that the \"refinement then selection\"  is still necessary and impactful. In Table 2, it is also somewhat puzzling that, in some cases, introducing negative primitives reduces fitting accuracy.\n2.The ensembling strategy is simple but underdeveloped. While it provides more candidate sets of convexes, it also increases computation time significantly. Besides, the number of primitives is preset, meaning the approach is only effective if sufficient networks are available to generate adequate candidates across diverse scenarios. A more effective approach might be to fuse all convexes from multiple networks and then learn to select the best results.\n3.Boolean primitives convincingly provide a more accurate and efficient scene representation. However, it is confusing that the maximum number of negative primitives is limited to only 2, and in some cases, the negatives actually reduce performance, as shown in Table 2. Additionally, the paper notes that the primary performance gains from the negative operation occur when a negative primitive occupies empty floor space, whereas it seems more reasonable that negative primitives should have greater potential to remove excess space occupied by positive primitives.\n4.In the experiments, the paper mainly compares its results to \"Convex decomposition of indoor scenes,\" but lacks a comparison to \"Robust Shape Fitting for 3D Scene Abstraction, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2024.\"  Besides, while shape abstraction is a lighter-weight representation, it would be appreciated to include application examples of convex decomposition for completeness."

The method is evaluated on the NYU v2 dataset, using reconstruction accuracy metrics for depth and normal, and segmentation accuracy, following the experimental setups of previous works. Notably, the proposed method significantly outperforms the most relevant SOTA method in depth accuracy."

Interestingly, using negative primitives alone shows limited performance gain, and the paper empirically demonstrates that a refine-then-choose strategy is more effective than the reverse.\n- The proposed method outperforms previous works across all metrics, with a notable improvement in depth accuracy over the current SOTA.\n- The bias loss term is well-motivated for negative primitives."

Evaluation on these larger datasets would strengthen the paper significantly.\n- Although well-motivated, the impact of the bias loss term does not seem significant or consistently effective in improving accuracy, as shown in Figure 8.\n- An ablation study on learning rate annealing is missing.\n- The paper lacks a theoretical explanation on why using negative primitives alone provides limited benefits and combining them with the ensemble method yields better performance."

However, the negative boolean primitive discussed in this work is relevant to the traditional CSG decompostion of 3D geometry. Moreover, can the proposed method be applied to more general CSG grammar?\n- The experiment setting of the evaluation section is not clearly illustrated. Specifically the major metric is the reconstruction metric, which might not convey enough message since the main goal of doing decomposition is to facilitate understanding. Moreover the experiment setting of the proposed method and prior works can be pretty different, since prior works do not predict negative primitives.\n- Bringing negative primitives to the prediciton result, although improving reconstruction accuracy, yet can bring other issues. For example, the segmentation and understanding can become more tricky when there are negative primitives.\n\n[Du et al. 2018] InverseCSG: automatic conversion of 3D models to CSG trees."
