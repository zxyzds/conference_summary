    "title": "ROMA: Regularization for Out-of-distribution Detection with Masked Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods without outlier exposure learn effective in-distribution (ID) representations distinguishable for OOD samples, which have shown promising performance on many OOD detection tasks. However, we find a performance degradation in some challenging OOD detection, where pre-trained networks tend to perform worse during the fine-tuning process, exhibiting the over-fitting of ID representations. Motivated by this observation, we propose a critical task of hidden OOD detection, wherein ID representations provide limited or even counterproductive assistance in identifying hidden OOD data. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Regularization framework for OOD detection with Masked Autoencoders (ROMA), which utilizes the masked image modeling task to regularize the network. With distribution-agnostic auxiliary data exposure, ROMA notably surpasses previous OOD detection methods in hidden OOD detection. Moreover, the robustness of ROMA is further evidenced by its state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for other challenging OOD detection tasks.",

Additionally, the analysis of the advantages of the proposed method over previous approaches in the context of the new task appears to be somewhat ambiguous. \n2. Regarding the research on the proposed hidden OOD detection task, there is a lack of detailed theoretical discussion on the concept and characteristics of hidden OOD in the task definition."

Further, related OOD literature has already noted the concept of reconstruction-based pretext tasks. Could the authors further clarify the distinctions between their work and previous studies, such as MOOD and MOODv2?\n2. What is the distinction between the proposed task (hidden OOD detection) and the challenge of mining difficult OOD samples at the edges of the ID manifold?"

Existing OOD methods often struggle with such hidden samples due to overfitting on ID representations, which can make certain OOD samples appear indistinguishable from ID data. ROMA tackles this by combining supervised classification on ID data with self-supervised masked image modeling on unlabeled auxiliary data, fostering more generalized feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate ROMA's superiority in both standard and hidden OOD benchmarks, showcasing state-of-the-art performance and robustness against ID overfitting. The authors highlight ROMA's practical applicability by avoiding reliance on explicit outlier datasets, making it well-suited for real-world OOD detection tasks."

Notably, ASH\u2019s application of sparsity makes it particularly relevant for comparison, given ROMA\u2019s use of masked autoencoders.\n\n2) Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is challenging to follow in certain sections. For example, line 220 introduces terms A and B without defining them, which makes the explanation harder to understand. Similarly, more detail is needed to clarify comparisons involving metrics like FPR for different representations.\n\n3) Complexity of Method Description: The dual-branch structure of ROMA, with supervised and self-supervised learning branches, could benefit from a clearer, step-by-step breakdown. The current description may overwhelm readers unfamiliar with masked autoencoder architectures or complex OOD detection setups.\n\n4) Scalability in Resource-Constrained Settings: ROMA relies on auxiliary image sets and masked autoencoder operations, which could demand significant computational resources. Additional analysis of ROMA's efficiency in resource-constrained environments, or a comparison with lighter approaches, would provide more practical insights for broader applicability.\n\n[1] Djurisic, Andrija, et al. \"Extremely simple activation shaping for out-of-distribution detection.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.09858 (2022).\n[2] Behpour, Sima, et al. \"GradOrth: a simple yet efficient out-of-distribution detection with orthogonal projection of gradients.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).\n[3] Huang, Rui, Andrew Geng, and Yixuan Li. \"On the importance of gradients for detecting distributional shifts in the wild.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 677-689."
