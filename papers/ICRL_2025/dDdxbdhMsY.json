    "title": "Deep Temporal Deaggregation: Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Access to spatio-temporal trajectory data is essential for improving infrastructure, preventing the spread of disease and for building autonomous vehicles. However, it remains underutilized due to limited availability, as it cannot be shared publicly due privacy concerns or other sensitive attributes. Generative time-series models have shown promise in generating non-sensitive data, but show poor performance for large-scale and complex environments. In this paper we propose a spatio-temporal generative model for trajectories, TDDPM, which outperforms and scales substantially better than state-of-the-art. The focus is primarily on trajectories of peoples' movement in cities. We propose a conditional distribution approach which unlock out-of-distribution generalization, such as to city-areas not trained on, from a spatial aggregate prior. We also show that data can be generated in a privacy-preserving manner using $k$-anonymity. Further, we propose a new comprehensive benchmark across several standard datasets, and evaluation measures, considering key distribution properties.",

To enable this generalization capability, the paper proposes using a heatmap as a conditioning constraint in a generative denoising diffusion model. Experiments on both unconditional trajectory generation and generation for new environments and hypothetical scenarios are conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. Additionally, the generation performance is analyzed under private heatmap scenarios."

The proposed method splits regions for training, but it is unclear whether the model can correctly generate cross-region trajectories under these conditions.\n3. In Table 2, the reasons why the model trained on 25% outperforms the model trained on 100% in most cases should be explained more clearly.\n4. As an ablation study, it would be helpful to include results when the model does not use the conditioning component for the unconditional trajectory generation task.\n5. Providing information on hyperparameters and including a complexity analysis would improve the paper.\n6. Typo:  \"ell(...\" should be \"l(...\" on Page 5."

TDDPM leverages a denoising diffusion approach to deaggregate spatial data into individual trajectories, allowing realistic time-series generation that generalizes to unseen areas. By conditioning on spatial aggregates, it achieves strong out-of-distribution performance. The model also uses k-anonymity for privacy and introduces a new benchmark for evaluating synthetic trajectory data, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and autonomous driving applications."

Experiments should be added to verify the effectiveness of proposed two steps mentioned in Section 4.\n4. The experiment setting is confusing. The authors claim that TDDPM could achieve out-of-distribution generalization in Abstract. More analysis should be added to demonstrate the diffirence between the synthetic dataset and Geolife/Porto.\n5. Line 308 to line 325 seems making no sense."
