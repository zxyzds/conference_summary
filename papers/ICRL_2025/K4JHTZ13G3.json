    "title": "Screener: Learning Conditional Distribution of Dense Self-supervised Representations for Unsupervised Pathology Segmentation in 3D Medical Images",
    "abstract": "In this paper we present a fully self-supervised framework for visual anomaly segmentation and apply it to pathology segmentation in 3D medical CT images. The core idea behind our framework is to learn conditional distribution of local image patterns given their global context. Thus, image patterns that have low conditional probability are assigned high anomaly scores.\nTo this end, we propose Screener comprised of descriptor,  condition, and density models.\nThe descriptor model encodes local image patterns into dense self-supervised representations. We enforce these descriptors to discriminate different image positions and remain invariant w.r.t. image augmentations that preserve local content.\nThe condition model produces auxiliary dense image representations, which we call conditions. We ensure that conditions encode the global contexts of individual image positions, by enforcing them to be invariant w.r.t. image masking.\nAt last, the density model learns the conditional density of descriptors for each given condition and produces anomaly segmentation scores.\nWe use this framework to train a fully self-supervised model for pathology segmentation on more than 30,000 3D CT images. Empirical study shows that Screener outperforms the existing unsupervised anomaly segmentation methods on four large-scale test CT datasets containing a total of 1820 3D images with four chest and abdominal pathologies.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Unclear Illustration of the Proposed Method:** The method section lacks clarity on what parts are novel contributions versus prior work. For example, Section 2.3 largely describes existing techniques, such as SimCLR and VICReg, but it\u2019s unclear how much these influence the new SCREENER model. The paper would benefit from clearly marking new contributions at the start of each subsection and relegating baseline methods to the experimental settings section. A figure illustrating the architecture would greatly improve comprehensibility.\n\n- **Inappropriate Metric Selection:** The paper focuses on anomaly segmentation, yet uses anomaly detection metrics (AUROC) rather than segmentation-specific metrics, such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Intersection over Union (IoU), Hausdorff Distance (HD), or Normalized Surface Distance (NSD). Without these, it\u2019s difficult to assess the model's effectiveness in precise segmentation of anomalies."

                "value": "1. Clarify Novelty in SCREENER: The proposed SCREENER method claims to modify the density-based UVAS framework but lacks clarity on what modifications were made and their specific advantages. Clear differentiation of new versus existing components would help readers understand the proposed method\u2019s originality.\n\n2. Dense Features Learned by SimCLR: The paper states that SimCLR learns \u201cdense features\u201d (lines 81-82), but this is misleading as SimCLR typically captures global features to distinguish one image from another. Defining what is meant by \"dense features\" here and how SimCLR is adapted for this purpose would improve accuracy.\n\n3. Define Key Terms: Essential terms like \"conditional distribution,\" \"local image patterns,\" and \"global image content\" are insufficiently explained, making the method challenging to follow. Definitions and possibly examples would clarify the underlying assumptions and techniques used.\n\n4. Figure 1 Anomaly Map Clarity: In Figure 1, the second column shows an image flagged as diseased (as indicated by attention maps), yet lacks a mask. A mask in this column or clearer labeling would clarify the model's detection process.\n\n5. AUROC Use for Segmentation Tasks: AUROC is not ideal for segmentation tasks, which typically require spatial accuracy. Metrics like HD or NSD would provide more nuanced insights into segmentation quality, particularly for edge or boundary delineation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Limited Comparative Evaluation: While SCREENER shows good performance on mixed CT datasets, it is challenging to assess its true impact due to the limited number of similar baseline methods for comparison. Including a maximum Dice score comparison to supervised SOTA or additional metrics from benchmarks like MOOD would allow for a clearer evaluation.\n\nLack of Standard Dataset Benchmarks: Although the authors focus on CT images, adding results on a standard brain dataset would help position SCREENER relative to established anomaly detection methods and increase its comparative strength even if this is not the primary goal of the work.\n\nDomain Gap Influence: The effect of domain gaps between different CT datasets is not discussed. SCREENER is tested on a single combined dataset, but further analysis of domain variance (standard deviations, confidence intervals) would better inform its generalizability. Clarifying how domain gaps might impact performance is also relevant, as it remains unclear how well SCREENER would generalize to datasets with different characteristics.\n\nArchitecture and Sampling Details: The choice of downsampling size (h, w, s), upsampling, and overall architecture needs further discussion to make the design decisions transparent and reproducible.\n\nRelated Work and Citations: The paper could improve its citation of related work, including references to early synthetic anomaly detection methods (e.g., FPI) and CRADL, which has a similar structure involving a SIMCLR pretrained encoder and Gaussian/flow-based density models. Additionally, work on applied studies on anomaly scoring could enhance the background section.\n\nClarity and Detail in Writing: The paper is somewhat unclear, with missing details that could make its contributions and methodology more convincing. For example, some claims (such as those about density models or scale of CT data) are not fully supported, and the paper\u2019s writing could more clearly convey the innovations and unique aspects of SCREENER.\n\nOverlapping Test and Training Data: Some test sets, like LiTS and KiTS, are partially represented in the training dataset AbdomenAtlas, which could raise concerns about test set contamination. While this overlap may not significantly affect results, a clear discussion of this issue is necessary to address any potential impacts."
