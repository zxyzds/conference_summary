    "title": "MLOT: Extending the Bipartite Structure towards Multi-Layered Structure for Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "Despite its remarkable success and widespread adoption in various domains, optimal transport (OT) has a rather simple structure, relying on bipartite graphs with only two layers of nodes for transportation. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered OT approach that extends the original two-layer structure to handle transportation problems across multiple hierarchical levels. Within this framework, the source distribution flows through intermediate layers, before reaching the target distribution. Unlike previous variants of OT that involve multiple distributions, our multi-layered OT typically involves uncertain intermediate distributions, which need to be computed based on the relationships between the preceding and succeeding distributions. Under entropic regularization, MLOT-Sinkhorn algorithm is further proposed for multi-layered OT, which can be accelerated using GPUs and significantly outperforms general solvers such as Gurobi. The theoretical results of our entropic MLOT are also given in this paper. In the experiments, we validate its speed advantage and convergence performance. We further validate its feasibility through Text-Image retrieval and intermediate image computing task, which demonstrates reformulating the problems as MLOT can achieve better results. Source code will be made available.",

Convergence was provided and experiments showed performance gains in solving the text-image retrieval problem."

In the second paragraph (line 039), they referenced transportation as the \"real-world\" example of the benefit of MLOT, by optimizing the freight transportation to reduce the cost and environmental impact, as suggested by their reference Bektas et al. 2019. However, throughout the paper, they didn't answer the question. Can MLOT help find the optimal routes and minimize the total cost? \n\nIn real-world problems, the intermediate distributions have certain constraints like the routes (cost matrix) and max capacity of the stops (intermediate distributions) in freight transportation example. The paper doesn't mention such constraints either in methodology or experiments. \n\nIn 4.2, MLOT was compared against softmax so it's not clear whether the gains were from OT or from the multi-layer formulation or both. \n\nFigure 7 in 4.3 also demonstrated that intermediate distributions may not be physically meaningful and smooth and thus not applicable to solving \"real-world problems\"."

                "value": "Line 323: Therefore, out MLOT can offer new perspectives and approximate computations for Dynamic OT and the Schrodinger bridge. What are the new perspectives? That MLOT can \"approximate computations for Dynamic OT and the Schrodinger bridge\" is a serious claim. I'd like the authors to provide evidence for that or tune down the sentence to something like whether we can approximate dynamic OT via MLOT is a future direction. And it's not clear in what aspect do we approximate. Is it the total cost or the transportation map or something else.\n\nComparing MLOT with barycenters should be expanded. In line 182, \"when $S=2$ in Eq.6 and $K=3$ in Eq.5, the optimization of our MLOT is equivalent to solving the Wasserstein barycenter.\" It's not, because for that to be true you have to assume $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{2}$, don't you? As we change $\\lambda$ in barycenters, we could also form a path of intermediate distributions between the target and the source. How is that process compared to MLOT?"

The related works section doesn't mention any previous works on multiple distributions in optimal transport although in the abstract, the authors state that \"Unlike previous variants of OT that involve multiple distributions,...\" (L19)\n3. Although the experimental results demonstrate significant improvements with MLOT over other optimization methods for multiple distributions, a comparison with other optimal transport (OT) methods of similar scope is missing. Specifically, the authors evaluated MLOT-Sinkhorn against non-OT methods, yet did not compare it with other OT-based approaches for finding optimal transport distances between multiple distributions.\n4. The overall writing is vague and the flow of the paper is difficult to follow. The related works are non-relevant to the methods proposed. For example, in Section 2, the authors mention Optimal Transport on a Graph and state that \"However, the above works rely on the shortest distances on the graph and do not directly compute the transport couplings in the graph. In this paper, we attempt to directly compute the transportation between nodes in a multi-layer structure.\". However, the paper lacks further comparisons or references to this aspect in later sections.\n5. Typo: In line 259, \"As shown in Fig. ,\", the figure is not specified."

My biggest question lies in the motivation for finding the OT distance between multiple distributions, which involves uncertain intermediate distributions, and only the source and the target distribution are known. As far as I understand, the motivation of the paper is from real-world problems, where finding the OT distance between two distributions is not enough, the case in which we assume that the source and the target distribution are known.\n2. How to compute the intermediate distributions as mentioned in the paper?\n3. Can you provide more baselines or related works of optimal transports in literature and explain clearly what is the difference between your methods and these methods?\n4. As far as I understand, the authors of (1) propose Sobolev Transport, which aims to find the optimal transport distance between 2 distributions, in which supports of these two distributions are nodes of the graph, which is different from the main purpose of this paper to find optimal transport map between multiple distributions. What does it mean by \"we attempt to directly compute the transportation between nodes in a multi-layer structure.\" (L135-136) since in (1), the nodes of one graph are support of two distributions?\n\n**Remark**: I gave a score of 5, but I am open to raising it once the above concerns are addressed and I have a clearer understanding of the paper. I will also reconsider my score following the rebuttal to ensure my evaluation is fully justified.\n\n(1) Tam Le, Truyen Nguyen, Dinh Phung, and Viet Anh Nguyen.
