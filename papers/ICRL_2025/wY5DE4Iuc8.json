    "abstract": "Single-cell spatial transcriptomics(scST) technology captures the coordinated of cells to unveil the intricate 3D cellular landscape of tissues. However, the accuracy of 3D tissue atlas is often compromised by experimental data gaps and distortions. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), known for their ability to continuously encode signals, have shown promise in medical imaging domains such as CT scan reconstruction. We introduce INRscrecon, a novel framework that utilizes the continuity of INRs to precisely predict and correct missing and distorted data sections, thereby enhancing the clarity and accuracy of tissue 3D reconstructions. This approach effectively addresses misalignments and data inconsistencies inherent in traditional experimental setups, markedly refining the fidelity of 3D spatial transcriptomic reconstructions.",

                "value": "This paper presents a method using INRs to continuously encode signals from single-cell spatial transcriptomics (scST). Specifically, they focus on the problem of 3D tissue reconstruction. Achieving accurate profiles of scST in 3D tissue is rendered challenging due to high likelihood of data contamination. Consequently, existing methods are forced to rely on low-resolution discrete representations to model the continuous representations of the data. The authors present a 3D reconstruction algorithm using INRs to impute missing gene expression data. They demonstrate results on 3 datasets and compare with 2 benchmark algorithms."

The authors clearly outline issues with the current practice of obtaining said data, and limitations in using a discrete representation.

While they use standard loss functions and a standard framework for reconstruction, they demonstrate significantly improved performance on three tasks compared with 2 baseline methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the paper addresses an important problem in 3D scST, this paper lacks methodological novelty and rigorous evaluation. \n\n### Method\nThe method is comprised of many standard blocks in 3D geometry. The alignment problem is simply a modification of the ICP algorithm. The INR model uses standard building blocks such as positional encodings and standard reconstruction losses. However, the authors do propose a representation consistency loss, which aims to map the input features to a latent space. The block maps the real and predicted features to the same space to ensure consistency. This loss appears to have a significant effect on performance as demonstrated by the ablation. However, this is not a novel proposed loss.\n\nLacking methodological novelty is fine provided the paper were accompanied by extensive experimentation on real, challenging data. However, the experiments are also limited, and are done on synthetic tasks.\n\n### Experiments\nThere are many questions and points of uncertainty in the experimental setup. As described, the authors use 3 datasets and quantify the ability of their method to continuously reconstruct 3D scST profiling. From these datasets, the authors randomly removed sections or points as data to reconstruct. However, there are many questions about this procedure and its reproducibility. First, why is removing sections or points a realistic experimental evaluation scenario? How was the random selection done? The authors should have used and described a reproducible criteria for this. \n\nFrom the baselines, it is unclear why these baselines are proper models to compare against. Why is a GCN model used for signal reconstruction? Why also use a simple VAE model rather than a more sophisticated one? Most importantly, why was training session limited to a duration of 30 minutes? This likely handicapped the baselines. Also, how was the data split? Was there a train and validation set? How were these used for the baselines? \n\nFinally, I have a hard time interpreting the results, particularly in the figures. The figure coordinate scales are not consistent nor described. In Fig. 7, why are there such large differences in the plotted color values? I also find the other figures difficult to interpret and are missing text describing the main takeaways. \n\n### Clarity of presentation\n- There are typos throughout the paper\n- Many figures are not descriptive and are missing proper legends. For example, Figure 1 has too much information with minimal accompanying text. The colormaps across figures are not consistent. For example the scale on Figure 3 is twice as large for the real data than the predicted."

                "value": "**Technical soundness**: Many studies have demonstrated that the continuous prior inherent in the INR network (also known as spectral bias [4]) serves as a powerful and general regularization for various inverse problems, including novel view synthesis [1][2], medical reconstruction [3], and more. However, most INR-based methods follow a standard framework: 1) using the INR network to represent the signals to be reconstructed; 2) using a differentiable forward model to simulate the physical acquisition process; 3) optimizing the INR network by minimizing the prediction errors on measurement data. The success of these methods largely relies on these aspects (i.e., the INR prior and the physical model). However, the proposed INRscrecon model directly uses an MLP network to fit the gene expression data without effectively modeling the physical acquisition process. In my opinion, this approach may not perform significantly better than traditional interpolation methods, such as cubic interpolation.\n\n**Experimental results**: From Figure 5, the reconstructions by the INRscrecon model appear to deviate significantly from the GT. Please clarify this observation.   Additionally, since the proposed method resembles traditional interpolation methods in essence, please provide comparison results using interpolation methods.\n\n**Area of expertise**: For the ICLR audience, 3D spatial transcriptomics reconstruction may be an unfamiliar field. Providing additional background information would improve readability.

Moreover, it uses an interesting combination of INRs, which operate on the coordinate level and continuously model the information with fully connected MLPs, and a feature alignment model with CNNs that operate in the image domain. This combination is relatively unique, especially in this context, and presents an interesting idea.\n\nSignificance: Given the new and interesting application of INRs in the transcriptomic domain, I believe the presented method would be relevant to the biological modeling community and may also spark interest in other INR-based modeling approaches, given that the learning-based feature alignment may constitute a generalized concept applicable for (rigid) registration. \n\nQuality: Considering the flaws in presentation and lack of details/concerns in evaluation, it is difficult to mention particular strengths of the paper in terms of its quality.\n\nClarity: The authors describe their problem statement very clearly (in the introduction)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Concerns regarding fair and optimal evaluation:\n\nThe manuscript states that all training was \"limited to a duration of 30 minutes\", which if I understand it correctly, does not consider - at all - if the models for the baseline (nor the presented method) have converged. Given this statement, it is highly unlikely the hyperparameters were optimized for the baselines, and I would doubt if the model performance of the presented method has been optimized as well in terms of hyperparameters. Given that the authors fail to provide any further details, the evaluation is very concerning and lacks any chance of reproducibility. \n\nLack of clarity in writing:\n\nAbstract: Given the length and content, I believe the Abstract does not reflect the actual paper content. It does not precisely state the problem the paper aims to address and does not mention the experimental setup and results. It is, for example, not clear that the authors use CNN-based feature alignment (at all), nor is it clear for the task of rigid (!) alignment. \n\nIntroduction & Related Work:\n- While I believe none of the content is wrong, substantial parts of related work and introduction are not ultimately relevant to the presented method. \n- While INRs have become prominent in MRI and CT reconstruction applications, this paper presents a very different application. The authors may acknowledge the work in other domains, but they should focus on more similar work and set their work into this context. For instance, INRs have been applied to cells [1] and non-deformable registration [2] - works that are ultimately (more) relevant to this paper but absent from the related works section. Also, I believe it would be very important to differentiate between cohort-based and single-instance approaches (two common INR concepts) and technical advances in INRs (e.g., SIREN, Hashgrid Encoding, Meta-Learning, etc.). \n\nDiscussion: The discussion does not **discuss** any relevant parts of the experiments. It does not provide any intuition on why the presented method provides better performance or why baselines fail or perform considerably worse. Moreover, the authors do not discuss limitations, etc., but just introduce new papers that are not relevant to the discussion (i.e., NeRFs). This section really needs re-writing.\n\nExperimental design, hyperparameters, and training setup:\n\n- The code is not available. Thus, it is ultimately important to have a detailed overview and insight into the architectural parameters for the paper, which is absent (except 3.2.2. regarding the number of layers in the MLP).\n- The authors do not state any hyperparameters of the baselines and selected method. It is unclear if the evaluation is fair and if the selected method was well-tuned. \nThe authors do not mention how the training scenarios differ for the baselines given that (mostly) only INR takes a single-image approach - were they trained (at all?), and were they trained in a fair manner?\n- The authors use positional encoding as in [3] but fail to appropriately cite it. Moreover, the reconstruction results look very blurry - perhaps this points to an issue in selecting appropriate Fourier Features [3], which have to be tuned and tailored to the application. Perhaps Hash-grid encoding would have been a better encoding? [4]\n- Experiments do not feature standard variations for INRscrecon and baselines (even though the header indicates that the authors wanted to do so), offering limited insights into the robustness of the method.\n- The authors show the results of ablation experiments but do not state how the final model weighted the different loss functions.\n\nConclusion: \nIn its current form, I believe the paper has major issues - especially in related works, reproducibility, and baseline comparisons, that do not comply with the standards posed by ICLR. The authors should incorporate the feedback into a revised version of the manuscript. \n\nReferences:\n[1] Wiesner D, Suk J, Dummer S, Svoboda D, Wolterink JM.
