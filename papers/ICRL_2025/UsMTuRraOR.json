    "title": "Human-like Communication Strategies for Improved Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has seen significant progress in recent years, enabling multiple agents to coordinate and optimize their actions in complex environments. However, integrating effective communication protocols into MARL frameworks remains a challenge, as it introduces issues such as increased state space dimensionality, lack of stationarity, and the need for interpretability. Inspired by human communication, which relies on prior knowledge, contextual awareness, and efficient information exchange, we propose a novel framework for incorporating human-like communication strategies to enhance the learning process. Motivated by recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), multi-modal AI and object detection, we use text-to-mask models and human feedback to learn compact and informative communication strategies that facilitate coordination among agents to improve the overall performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on various multi-agent tasks and provide insights into emergent communication behaviors observed during training.",

                "value": "The paper presents a framework to integrate human-like communication strategies into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance performance in complex tasks. Inspired by human communication, the authors incorporate a \"text-to-mask\" model to focus on relevant features in observations and use imitation to human demonstrations as an auxiliary objective. The proposed approach, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) and rule-based strategies, is tested in environments with high partial observability. Results suggest that the hybrid approach achieves faster learning and improved interpretability in communication behaviors."

Elaborating upon human communication strategies such as prior knowledge, contextual understanding and efficient information exchange with specific examples of how they are useful in human context and how they could be useful in the context of multi-agent RL would help motivate the approach better. Section 4.1 does attempt to do the above, partially, however, improving its sentence formation and incorporating it in the Introduction would strengthen the introduction. \n\n* The approach is not compared against standard MARL baselines such as IPPO [1], MAPPO [2], QMix [3], \n\n* The experiments are performed on rather toyish and non-standard environments. Validating the results on standard environments (for eg. environment from OpenAI's Multi Particle Environment suite) and environments with higher dimensional observation spaces (such as Starcraft) would strengthen the paper significantly.\n\n* The authors do not provide any hyperparameter details. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Chao Yu, Akash Velu, Eugene Vinitsky, Yu Wang, Alexandre Bayen, and Yi Wu.

Yet, it faces challenges like non-stationarity and interpretability. This paper proposes a more human-like communication approach. More specifically, it uses text-to-mask models which map descriptions of an object to a mask. The communication protocol is learned via DIAL with human demonstrations. Such object-oriented and mask-based messaging makes it relatively straightforward to leverage human demonstrations, with higher interpretability. The method\u2019s effectiveness is demonstrated on two newly proposed multi-agent tasks."

As for line 162 that \"For example, switching the observations of two agents, so each one observes the other\u2019s position instead of its own (but controls its own movements),\" I have some different viewpoints. Is it still valid when the reward function is a invariant to observations or agents' observations are symmetric? In either case, we can still always find a relation between reward function and observations.\n3. About line 193-195 that \"In the general vector case, it is natural to view the observation as a collection of feature-sets, each one corresponding with a textual term that represent an object,\" why can this form of observation representation can enhance identification of the relevancy of an object?\n4. As for line 199-200 that \"For image observations, it is possible to use existing pretrained object detection models to extract the mask and additional features,\" even if the proposed text-to-mask is good representation, the inaccuracy brought up by the pretrained feature extractor can still lead to some unexpected errors. In turn, the embedding is still uninterpreted.\n5. As for line 208-210 that \"As many other works ... implements both agents,\" why do you choose the decoupled policies for selecting actions and communications, respectively? If there is no justifiable reasons, this setup would only result in more parameters.\n6. As for line 237-239 that \"For $\\pi^{comm}$ ... with the receiving agent,\" why is this reasonable? Is there any special considerations behind this design?\n7. As for line 243-244 that \"Then at inference ... messages only,\" is this a logical reason to explain why encoder network is disregarded? Could you give more clarification about this?\n8. As for line 289-292 that \"We propose ... demonstrations,\" how is the rule-based policy or human demonstrations be guaranteed to find for every task?
