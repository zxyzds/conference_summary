    "title": "TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the anonymous link https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RobustBenchHAR-5492/README.md and supplementary material.",

Although it is reasonable to assume that a smoother loss landscape benefits transfer attacks, exploring the reasons for poor transferability in S-HAR tasks and comparing the differences among surrogate models may reveal various factors. Therefore, directly concluding that smoothing the loss landscape is the sole solution may not be entirely logical.\n\n2. In this method, an MLP is primarily added after the original model. However, the consideration of first-order velocity and second-order acceleration to capture spatial-temporal information, as mentioned in this paper, has already been addressed by SMART (Wang et al., 2021), which limits the novelty of this approach.\n\n3. The Bayesian optimization approach used in this method is similar to BEAT (Wang et al., 2023), and the differences between the two approaches should be discussed further."

                "value": "Major: \n\n- One of the major issues of this paper is that some of the concepts presented in the paper are not properly and clearly explained. For example, in abstract section, what is \"white-box scenarios\". Also what does it mean by saying \"its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR\"?\n\n- Fig. 1 is not being introduced and explained clearly. For example, what is spatial attack, spatial-temporal attack, why frozen, trainable, being lightweight and demanding? What are appended models and dual bayesian? These concepts should be clearly explained to readers, either in texts or figure caption. Moreover, how to tell which one is better? \n\n- The introduction section is not very well-motivated. For example, in Line 83, referring to Table 1; however, the concepts to understand the table are not being explained. The authors are encouraged to reorganise the section, explain the concepts properly before going deep into the technical jargon. What is \"white-box\"? In contribution section, what is \"low adversarial transferability\"?\n\n- In related work section, the authors outline some closely related works; however, they do not highlight what are the major differences between existing works and the proposed method, what are the insights, how the proposed method has the potential to address the challenges etc.\n\n- Fig. 2, the font sizes are invisible to reviewer, what are the x and y axis represent for? What do \"random direction vectors\" mean? These concepts should be properly explained. \n\n- In Eq. (2), what are boldface $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$ mean?  In Line 158 and 183, it says \"a clean motion\" and \"the adversarial sample\", what do they mean and how they align with each other, what would be the relationship between them? These concepts and maths symbols are not properly explained. It is suggested to have a notation section detailing the maths symbols and operations used in the paper. Eq. (3) right hand side is a bit confusing, the reviewer cannot understand that, could you explain step by step?\n\n\nMinor:\n\n-  Remove the  full stop \".\" inside Sec. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 headings.\n\n- Table of font sizes should be consistent in the whole paper. In the main paper, table 1, 2, 3 and 5 font sizes are too small, and hard to read; however, table 6 in appendix section, the font sizes are too big. The authors should make those representations consistent and nicer.\n\n- While the maths presented in the paper seem to be accurate, its presentations, especially in the method section, needs extensive improvement. The reviewer gets lost many times, and some of the concepts are not very well introduced and explained. A good paper should explain these concepts clearly and in a more intuitive way. \n\n- An excellent paper should use efficient figures and plots to show the experimental results. In this paper, most experimental results are presented in the form of tables, it would be better if the authors could provide some plots and visualisations to make the evaluations, comparisons and analysis more interesting to wide communities."
