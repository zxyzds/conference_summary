    "title": "DEGS: Deformable Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting from RGB and Event Stream",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can provide super-fast visual change acquisition asynchronously while not containing color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. \nHowever, the data format of the two modalities is very different, and currently, no methods directly optimize dynamic 3DGS from events and RGB images. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies: motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.",

The authors integrate an event-based optical flow estimator as part of the pipeline to predict 2D optical flow from event data. Using an unsupervised LoRA-based framework, they fine-tune the event flow estimator to adapt to unseen scenes while preserving the original priors. Subsequently, by applying projection and motion decomposition, they associate 3D Gaussians with 2D optical flow estimates, allowing the event data to supervise the deformation field in 3D space.\n\n[1] Wu, G., Yi, T., Fang, J., Xie, L., Zhang, X., Wei, W., ... & Wang, X.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The base assumptions in this paper somewhat diverge from real-world conditions. Although event data, due to its high temporal resolution, can provide detailed inter-frame motion clues for large or rapid movements, the large motions (fast movements) would, in practice, result in motion blur in RGB frames captured by regular cameras. However, the experiments in the paper assume that sparse, clear RGB frames are available\u2014a point that warrants reconsideration. Using event data to deblur RGB frames could be a potential solution.\n\n2. Using 2D optical flow estimates obtained from events as supervision signals introduces substantial noise into the optimization process for 3DGS and deformation fields, as the optical flow estimates are not entirely accurate (and the authors did not analyze the intermediate results of the optical flow estimation in their experiments).\n\n3. I have concerns about the plausibility of the authors' proposed method for fine-tuning a pre-trained optical flow estimator using the event flow from a single scene. First, the paper does not provide details on the dataset used for fine-tuning, nor does it offer any quantitative evaluation of the fine-tuned estimator. The qualitative comparison in the two presented frames lacks Ground Truth, rendering it unconvincing. Moreover, the Contrast Maximization (CM) framework [3] used by the authors is only a model-based event flow estimation method, and its performance is often unstable and not accurate enough in various situations. Thus, the claim that fine-tuning EvFlowNet [1] using CM can improve performance is questionable.\n\n4. Further discussion reveals that LoRA [2] is typically used to fine-tune large models trained on massive datasets to adapt to specific domains or tasks. However, the rationale for applying LoRA [2] to fine-tune a small model focused on a specific task like optical flow estimation using event flow from a single scene is questionable. Additionally, the pre-trained EvFlowNet [1] model mentioned in the paper has not been trained on a broad dataset; it is generally trained in very limited scenarios, such as those encountered in autonomous driving or drone perspectives. Therefore, the performance of the fine-tuned optical flow estimator and its ability to generalize to different motion patterns are concerning.\n\n5. The authors' method of directly applying Structure from Motion (SfM) to multi-view inconsistent image sequences for obtaining point cloud initialization may not be well-defined and has certain limitations. While it is true that 3DGS does not require a completely accurate initialization, it is important to note that a high proportion of dynamic elements in the scene or low texture in static areas can hinder SfM from providing a reasonable initialization point cloud. Consequently, this method may fail in some scenarios.\n\n6. The selection of comparison pipelines in the authors' experimental section is not reasonable, thus lacking persuasiveness. Among the four baselines compared, only one is an event-based radiance field reconstruction method, while the others are based on RGB data. The authors should compare their method with more radiance field approaches that utilize both event and RGB modalities, such as EvDNeRF [4].\n\n7. The experimental setup for comparisons with RGB-based methods may be unfair, as the paper does not detail the number of RGB frames used by different pipelines during evaluation. Since RGB-based methods do not benefit from additional event data supervision, relying solely on sparsely sampled RGB frames makes it difficult to achieve good performance. This may also explain why the performance of the RGB-based methods in this paper is generally lower than that reported in the original papers. Therefore, using the same number of sparse RGB sequences for all pipelines while allowing the authors' pipeline to utilize additional event information constitutes an unfair comparison. The authors should establish a more equitable experimental setup that enables the RGB-based pipelines to perform at their normal levels. This situation reflects the authors' underlying assumption that ordinary cameras can still capture clear RGB images during large or rapid movements, which limits the practical value of their pipeline. Conversely, if ordinary cameras could obtain dense and clear RGB sequences, the necessity of incorporating event data would warrant reconsideration. Event cameras typically demonstrate their advantages over traditional cameras under high-speed motion and low-light conditions.\n\n[1] Zhu, A. Z., Yuan, L., Chaney, K., & Daniilidis, K. (2018).

The main goal of the proposed method is to accelerate the training speed of the previous event-based methods and reduce rendering costs. The most significant contribution to achieving this goal is to change the baseline (Deformable NeRF [R1]) of DE-NeRF to Deformable 3DGS, which appears to lack novelty.\n2. The proposed unsupervised finetuning of the event flow predictor is unreliable. In section 3.2, the authors use equation 8 to finetune EV-flownet. However, the text lacks further analysis or related work to support that maximizing the variance of predicted optical flow (which differs from CM loss [R2]) could facilitate achieving more accurate flow prediction. A comprehensive study with convincing validation is necessary.\n3. The details of the experiments lack clarity. The authors should explain how to create the train-test sets in the nine scenarios to ensure that the test set is captured in a novel view. It is worth noting that the three realistic scenarios from the HS-ERGB dataset were recorded using only one static camera, which implies that they cannot be utilized to evaluate the performance of novel view synthesis.\n4. The writing quality of this paper is poor. Several crucial parts of the exposition are unclear. For example, why is it necessary to build event-Gaussian association in section 3.3 (since you can directly use optical flow to optimize the warp field without the association)? The utilization of symbols in section 3.2 (e.g., t_{r}ef), section 3.4 (e.g., the Proj function whose timestamp corresponding to the camera transformation matrix is not specific), and section 3.5 (e.g., the timestamp t1 and t2) is also confusing.\n\n\n[R1] Park K, Sinha U, Barron J T, et al.

DEGS creatively proposes the LoCM module, a training module for event flow prediction that combines LoRA and contrast maximization, providing an event flow prior for deformation field optimization. The rendered depth map is used as a medium to establish a connection between 2D events and 3DGS units through inverse projection.
