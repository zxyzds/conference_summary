    "title": "Elucidating the Design Choice of Probability Paths in Flow Matching for Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling, and has been extended to probabilistic time series forecasting in latent spaces. However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.",

                "value": "This paper addresses spatio-temporal forecasting using latent flow matching. In spatio-temporal forecasting, the performance of flow matching is highly dependent on the choice of the probability path model. To address this, the authors propose a new probability path model that accounts for the inherent continuity and correlation in spatio-temporal data, aiming to shorten the interpolating path."

An ablation study demonstrating the benefits of modeling in the latent space would be valuable (Please correct me if I missed this)."
