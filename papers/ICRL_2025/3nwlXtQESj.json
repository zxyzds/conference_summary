    "abstract": "Geometric deep learning (GDL) has demonstrated enormous power in molecular data analysis. However, GDL faces challenges in achieving high efficiency and expressivity in molecular representations when high-order terms of the atomic force fields are not sufficiently learned. In this work, we introduce message passing on path complexes, called the Path Complex Message Passing, for molecular prediction. Path complexes represent the geometry of paths and can model the chemical and non-chemical interactions of atoms in a molecule across various dimensions. Our model defines messages on path complexes and employs neural message passing to learn simplex features, enabling feature communication within and between different dimensions. Since messages on high-order and low-order path complexes reflect different aspects of molecular energy, they are updated sequentially according to their order. The higher the order of the path complex, the richer the information it contains, and the higher its priority during inference. It can thus characterize various types of molecular interactions specified in molecular dynamics (MD) force fields. Our model has been extensively validated on benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.\nThe code is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Path-Complex-Neural-Network-32D6}",

                "value": "- Incorporate geometric features like bond, angles, dihedrals and improper angles in the modeling is not novel, as seen in Fig.2 of [1] and Fig.2 of [2]. There are also many works already involved these many-body systems.\n- Although the paper introduces the concept of a \u201cpath complex,\u201d the actual features used, which are bond distances and angles (Table 5), are standard. Similar methods already exist, such as hierarchical message passing for updating geometric embeddings in [2]. Also, models like NequIP, Allegro, and MACE employ **many-body expansions** in message passing, leveraging **tensor products** to incorporate higher-order geometric tensors (a path fusing process [3]), which are beyond the basic features mentioned in this paper. PCMP maybe a subset of the tensor products. A more comprehensive literature review is needed for the authors [4, 5].\n- The primary weakness is that the authors claim that they are inspired by MD force fields, but **no results on any standard MD benchmark, such as MD17, rMD17, MD22 are provided**. Not to mention the conduction of MD simulations further driven by this MLFF. Since the paper focuses on molecular 3D structures, **it\u2019s a necessity to proof invariance or equivariance**, which are missing here. In contrast, this paper provides a list of the graph path theories, appears more relevant to topological graphs and is insufficient to address geometric graphs. Furthermore, despite claiming that the method \u201cenables systematic exploration of connectivity and interaction for analyzing complex systems and networks,\u201d **there are no experiments on these tasks supporting this claim**.\n- The GEM paper is relatively old and actually we do not need to generate 3D structures using RDKit from smiles for the 2D molecule datasets. Beside the datasets mentioned in the above question, **numerous 3D molecular datasets for DFT-level property prediction, such as QM9 (with 12 targets), OC20, OE62, and PCQM4Mv2, are available**. I strongly recommend evaluating PCMP on these benchmarks for a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n[1] Wang, Yusong, et al. \"Enhancing geometric representations for molecules with equivariant vector-scalar interactive message passing.\" Nature Communications 15.1 (2024): 313.\n\n[2] Pei, Hongbin, et al. \"Hago-net: Hierarchical geometric massage passing for molecular representation learning.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Without benchmarking against MM force fields, the claim appears unsupported, and this oversight detracts from the paper's validity in this area.\n  \n2. **Computational Complexity**: The inclusion of path complexes, especially higher-order ones, is likely computationally demanding. However, the authors do not provide insights into potential trade-offs, such as runtime or scalability on larger datasets.\n\n3. **Lack of Equivariance in Model Design**: Given the model\u2019s target application in molecular property prediction, its architecture does not incorporate rotational or translational equivariance, which would enhance its ability to handle spatial molecular data more robustly. Adding equivariant layers could make the model better suited to capturing geometry-sensitive properties.\n\n4. **Interpretability**: The model\u2019s complex hierarchical structure might hinder interpretability, as it\u2019s not clear which paths contribute most significantly to predictions or whether high-order interactions have consistent relevance across datasets.

Is it possible to implement this? \n4.  For Figure 4, does the path complex graph alleviate the over-squashing? If so, can the author provide an empirical study on this, for example, compare the effective resistance.\n5.

There's inadequate discussion of computational overhead and scalability. The path complex representation likely introduces significant computational costs, but this isn't analyzed.
