    "title": "Measurement information multiple-reuse allows deeper quantum transformer",
    "abstract": "The current era has witnessed the success of the transformer in the field of classical deep neural networks (DNNs) and the potential of quantum computing. One naturally expects that quantum computing can offer significant speedup for the transformer. Recent developments of quantum transformer models are faced with challenges including the expensive cost of non-linear operations and the information loss problem caused by measurements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scheme called measurement information multiple-reuse (MIMR). MIMR enables the repeated utilization of intermediate measurement data from former layers, thus enhancing information-transferring efficiency. This scheme facilitates our quantum vision transformer (QViT) capable of achieving exponential speedup compared to classical counterparts, with the support of many parameters and large depth. Our QViT model is further examined with an instance of 86 million parameters, which halves the requirements for tomography error compared to the one without MIMR. This demonstrates the superior performance of MIMR over existing schemes. Our findings underscore the importance of exploiting the value of information from each measurement, offering a key strategy towards scalable quantum deep neural networks.",

Lack of Novelty: The approach of replacing mathematical operations with quantum gates is not novel, as this concept has been widely explored and documented, notably in the qBLAS library.

Limited In-depth Consideration: While the authors propose using residual connections within quantum circuits\u2014an idea inspired by classical neural network architectures\u2014this adaptation requires more critical evaluation. In classical settings, residual connections support the training of deeper models; however, applying this concept to quantum circuits entails significant challenges. Specifically, implementing residual connections in quantum circuits would necessitate re-preparing the quantum states following mid-circuit measurements, which imposes a substantial computational burden. This could potentially negate the speed advantages typically offered by quantum computing. The primary challenge, as acknowledged in quantum computing literature, for training deep quantum circuits relates to the fact that deeper quantum circuits can approximate more easily Haar random quantum states.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of residual connections within quantum circuits has already been explored, as evidenced in [1]. The paper would benefit from a clearer discussion of how its approach differs from or builds upon prior work in this area.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15871"

                "value": "1. The query complexity presented in Theorem 3.1 can be better discussed and investigated. As written in the main text, the quantum query complexity goes as $O(ld^2\\mathrm{polylog}(n)/\\epsilon\\delta^2)$ whereas classical goes as $O(lnd(n+d)\\mathrm{log}(1/\\epsilon))$. The text is quick to point out the quantum advantage in $n$, but does not fully discuss the quantum disadvantage at small values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. In practice, in remains unclear whether a QViT will be operating in the limit of large $n$, or small $\\delta$ or $\\epsilon$. These points are not discussed sufficiently nor investigated numerically. Consequently, the motivation for QViTs seems speculative at this stage.\n2. The title, which states that MIMR allows for deeper quantum transformers, seems unjustified. Experiments are done with respect to different degrees of tomography errors, and do not vary depth.\n3.  Experiments seem to only be conducted for a single random seed. It would be better to provide several runs of each experiment and present means and standard deviations or similar.\n4. The benefit of MIMR is seemingly at very specific range of range of values: at $\\delta=0$, single-reuse and multiple reuse are presented as identical. At $\\delta=0.004$, multiple reuse performance also breaks down. It seems that the specific values at which MIMR might provide a benefit are $\\delta \\in \\\\{0.002, 0.003\\\\}$. Results for $\\delta=0.001$ are not presented. This seems a particularly narrow range compared to the [work that establishes $l_\\infty$ tomography](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_Hygab1rKDS.html), which considers values of $\\delta$ up to $0.1$.\n5. The motivation of the work remains unclear. Since it relies on a host of quantum technologies not currently convincingly implemented (QRAM, amplitude encoding, $l_\\infty$ tomography). Convincing error mitigation is currently not even demonstrated despite having been the subject of intense research. The techniques required seem even more involved: it seems quite plausible that transformers might not be of research interest by the time (if ever) this architecture is practically implementable on a real device."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Suggestions:\n1. Run experiments over multiple random seeds and report aggregated performance metrics.\n2. An investigation over a wider range of $\\delta$ would be beneficial to demonstrate the efficacy of MIMR. For example, [Kerenidis 2020](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_Hygab1rKDS.html) considers values of $\\delta=0.01$ and $\\delta=0.1$. The range of values in this work seem small in comparison, and thus seem to be operating closer to a regime where the quantum advantage over classical in query complexity is diminished.\n3. Provide a fuller discussion on where quantum might have an advantage over classical for QViTs, explaining clearly the tradeoffs between $\\epsilon$, $\\delta$ and $n$.\n4. The long-term view of such quantum models should be made clear to ICLR readership, who are likely not quantum computing specialists. It is unclear when (or even if) tools like QRAM, tomography and amplitude encoding might be available on a practical device.\n5. The idea of MIMR seems applicable to multiple architectures. Choosing to demonstrate it on a lightweight architecture and a simpler task seems to me to provide better opportunity to fully investigate its efficacy. By the time quantum computers can implement QViTs as presented, I think it's likely that the ML research community might have moved past transformers anyway. I appreciate this is a major change which is likely not implementable during the review period, but I do believe it would lead to a stronger and more general piece of work, in that it would allow MIMR to be presented as a general strategy as opposed to one pertaining to QViTs.\n6. If stating that MIMR allows for deeper transformers, then there should be some numerical results with various transformer depths demonstrating the positive impact of MIMR vs single reuse."
