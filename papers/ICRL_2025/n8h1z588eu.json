    "title": "Relax and Merge: A Simple Yet Effective Framework for Solving Fair $k$-Means and $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter Problems",
    "abstract": "The fairness of clustering algorithms has gained widespread attention across various areas, including machine learning, In this paper, we study fair $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space. \n  Given a dataset comprising several groups, the fairness constraint requires that each cluster should contain a proportion of points from each group within specified lower and upper bounds. \n  Due to these fairness constraints, determining the optimal locations of $k$ centers is a quite challenging task. \n  We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge'' framework that returns a $(1+4\\rho + O(\\epsilon))$-approximate solution,  where $\\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm and $O(\\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. If equipped with a PTAS of $k$-means, our solution can achieve an approximation ratio of $(5+O(\\epsilon))$  with only a slight violation of the fairness constraints, which improves the current state-of-the-art approximation guarantee. Furthermore, using our framework, we can also obtain a $(1+4\\rho +O(\\epsilon))$-approximate solution for the $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem, which is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of optimal transport, and a $(2+6\\rho)$-approximate solution for the strictly fair $k$-means clustering with no violation, both of which are better than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of clustering  cost.",

                "value": "$ (\\alpha, \\beta) $ -fair k-means clustering is a group-based notion of fairness where the number of points belonging to each protected 'group' (race, gender etc.) inside each cluster is bounded. The paper provides algorithms for $ (\\alpha, \\beta) $ -fair k-means clustering and strictly $ (\\alpha, \\beta) $ -fair k-means clustering that have better approximation ratios than existing works. This is achieved by considering the group-based fairness constraints before choosing the location of the centers rather than first choosing centers and then trying to assign points to centers according to fairness constraints.  The paper also gives approximation guarantees for $k$- Sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem that tries to find an 'average' distribution with a support size of $k$, for given discrete $m$ distributions, by treating the problem as a special case of fair clustering.  The theoretical results are supported by empirical evaluations."

While the fair $k$-means clustering problem has been extensively studied in recent years, the existing approximation algorithms often incur at least a constant factor loss on the clustering quality guarantee in order to find good clustering centers for fair clustering instances that do not satisfy the \u201cVoronoi properties\u201d. To reduce the approximation loss, this paper introduces the notion of $\\epsilon$-approximation centroid set, which can well approximate the locations for the optimal clustering centers under fairness constraints. Building on notion of the $\\epsilon$-approximation centroid set, this paper proposes a Relax-and-Merge framework. The Relax-and-Merge framework first decomposes the given clustering instance into smaller partitions satisfying the fairness constraints (with more than $k$ partitions obtained) to construct a weighted instance. Then, by executing a weighted standard $k$-means algorithm on the weighted instance constructed, a solution satisfying the fairness constraints can be obtained  using linear programming rounding method, with better approximation guarantee on the clustering quality. Additionally, this paper shows that the proposed framework can also be extended to solve the $k$-sparse Wasserstein barycenter problem and strictly fair $k$-means problem. The experiments show that the proposed Relax-and-Merge framework achieves better clustering cost compared with other fair clustering algorithms, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

The task is to find $k$ clustering centers and partition $G$ into $k$ clusters so that for every $i\\in [k],j\\in [m]$ cluster $P_i$ must contain at least $\\alpha_j|P_i|$  points and at most $\\beta_j|P_i|$ points from group $G_j$.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is two improved approximation algorithms for fair $k$-means. The first algorithm shows one can compute a $1+4\\rho+\\epsilon$ approximation with constant violation in fairness constraints by running upon an existing $\\rho$-approximation algorithm for vanilla Euclidean $k$-means. This algorithm also relies on a centroid of size $O(n\\epsilon^{-d}\\log \\epsilon^{-1})$ thus the running time is exponential on $d$. The second algorithm is designed for the strictly fair $k$-means, namely $\\forall i, \\alpha_i=\\beta_i=\\frac{1}{m}$. A $ 2+6\\rho$ approximation without violation is obtained. Both algorithms have better approximation ratios than previous results. The authors also observe that the first algorithm can be extended to a related problem called $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter.\n\nTechnically, authors observe that one can first compute an optimal assignment from the data set to a centroid set and then reduce the problem to the vanilla $k$-means by assigning each data point to its center in the centroid set. The idea is simple but effective. Experiments also show improvement over previous results.\n\nOverall, I think this paper reaches the acceptance bar."

The paper gives (1+4c+O(\\eps))-approximation algorithm with running time that has an exponential dependence on the dimension d and polynomial dependence on other parameters. The suggested algorithm first finds an \\eps-centroid set T using Matousek's algorithm. This is followed by assigning points to centers in the set T by solving an LP that guarantees fairness. The size of T is exponential in dimension d. Since k centers need to be produced, the algorithm finds k centers by running a c-approximation algorithm for the vanilla k-means algorithm over points that are \"moved\" to their respective centers in T. Finally, integer assignments are found using ideas of Bera et al. (LP rounding), which causes minor violations in fairness conditions. This two-step process (clustering points using T followed by clustering T) is called Relax-and-Merge. Similar ideas have been used in the past (see, e.g., [A]), and the approximation analysis of the two-step process is similar to previous results (see Theorem 4 in [A]).\n\n[A] https://theory.stanford.edu/~nmishra/Papers/clusteringDataStreamsTheoryPractice.pdf\n\nAdditional comment: I have reviewed an earlier version of the paper, and much of the review is from my earlier review. The current version improves the number of violations in the special case of mutually disjoint groups. This is shown by setting up an appropriate minimum-cost circulation problem."
