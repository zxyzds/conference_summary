    "title": "Coupling Category Alignment for Graph Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Graph domain adaptation (GDA), which transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target graph domain, attracts considerable attention in numerous fields. \nEmerging methods commonly employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations by aligning the entire domain distribution. However, these methods overlook the category-level distribution alignment across different domains, potentially leading to confusion of categories. \nTo address the problem, we propose an effective framework named \\textbf{Co}upling \\textbf{C}ateg{o}ry \\textbf{A}lignment (\\method{}) for GDA, which effectively addresses the category alignment issue with theoretical guarantees.\n\\method{} incorporates a graph convolutional network branch and a graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. To mitigate category-level domain shifts, we leverage knowledge from both branches, iteratively filtering highly reliable samples from the target domain using one branch and fine-tuning the other accordingly. Furthermore, with these reliable target domain samples, we incorporate the coupled branches into a holistic contrastive learning framework. This framework includes multi-view contrastive learning to ensure consistent representations across the dual branches, as well as cross-domain contrastive learning to achieve category-level domain consistency.\nTheoretically, we establish a sharper generalization bound, which ensures the effectiveness of category alignment.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \\method{} compared with baselines.",

Specifically, the proposed graph convolutional network branch and graph kernel network branch are very similar to the two branches presented in [1]. Additionally, the proposed multi-view contrastive learning and cross-domain contrastive learning approaches are closely aligned with the cross-branch contrastive learning and cross-domain contrastive learning proposed in [1].\n\nThis paper lacks self-containment. Many mathematical symbols are used without definition; for example, in line 139, it is unclear what Z, h, and \\hat{h} represent.\n\nSome theorem definitions lack rigor. For instance, \"Theorem 2\" is not a true theorem but rather a corollary inferred from Theorem 1, as also stated in [2]. Similarly, \"Theorem 4\" should not be classified as a theorem, as it is also a corollary based on an existing theorem.\n\nTheorem 2 seems to be built on a binary classification task. Does Theorem 4, which builds on Theorem 2, apply to the multi-class tasks in this paper? Further explanation is needed here, given that the paper addresses category-level domain shifts.\n\nExperiments are conducted on very small datasets. The proposed method should be validated on other widely used graph domain adaptation datasets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and Pileup datasets.\n\n[1] CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Classification. \n\n[2] Graph Domain Adaptation via Theory-Grounded Spectral Regularization."

As in CoCo[1] and DEAL[2], the experiments on real-world benchmark datasets (e.g., DD, COX2, COX2_MD, BZR, and BZR_MD) will be much more informative. Authors could prove the effectiveness of their strategies by constructing experiments on various real-world datasets as the previous work CoCo and DEAL. Besides, the new processed dataset is also not publically available, from the paper I can't get a sufficient understanding of this specific setting.\n2.Although the results in Table 1 and Table 2 are impressive, it is unclear if the comparison is completely fair. Specifically, this paper compares their results with other works on the conventional graph network backbone. The authors exploit a new GMT graph network as the MPbranch while many methods in Table 1 and 2 do not use a new graph network. Comparing previous methods with the proposed attention-based method on conventional graph network is not fair.\n\n3. The method seems like an application on the GDA network with respect to the graph kernel method. In the introduction, the first contribution is not specific to this paper. The discussion for solving the discrepancy in the distribution of graph categories between the source and target domains was already in DEAL[2]."

To fully validate the superiority of the proposed CoCA model, more SOTA UDA methods should be included in comparison experiments.\n2. More insightful analyses should be provided. For example, the visualization of the feature refined by the SP branch should be shown.\n3. The current experiments are conducted on specially set datasets, which is not sufficient. It is recommended to conduct on real-world datasets as previous works CoCo[1] and DEAL[2]."

The paper makes ambitious claims about CoCA\u2019s effectiveness across multiple datasets; however, the lack of a rigorous ablation study to dissect each component\u2019s contribution weakens the evidence of its effectiveness. Without such analysis, it\u2019s unclear if the improvements stem from the method itself or merely the combination of existing techniques.\n2. The theoretical guarantees provided seem somewhat underdeveloped for the complexity of the task. While the paper introduces bounds, the assumptions and conditions for these bounds are not well-explained, which limits their practical relevance and could make it difficult for others to validate or build upon this work\n3. The paper's presentation could be more accessible; currently, it assumes a high level of familiarity with domain-specific jargon and concepts. A broader contextualization of the problem in simpler terms would make the work more approachable for a wider audience.\n4. The introduction and contributions are not clearly delineated. The authors should explicitly outline the main research gaps addressed by CoCA and clarify how each component contributes to solving these gaps.\n5. The Related Work section could be expanded, particularly to discuss univariate and multivariate graph-based domain adaptation approaches. This would help situate CoCA more clearly within the broader field.\n6. There is a lack of analysis on the algorithmic complexity of CoCA, especially regarding the iterative optimization and contrastive learning modules. This could be a concern for scalability in large datasets and should be addressed."
