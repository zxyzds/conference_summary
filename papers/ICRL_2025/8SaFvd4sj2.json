    "title": "FCVL: Fourier Cross-View Learning for Generalizable 3D Object Detection in Bird\u2019s Eye View",
    "abstract": "Improving the generalization of Birds' Eye View (BEV) detection models is essential for safe driving in real world. In this paper, we consider a realistic yet more challenging scenario, which aims to improve the generalization with single source data for training, as collecting multiple source data is time-consuming and labor intensive in autonomous driving. To achieve this, we rethink the task from a frequency perspective and exploit the cross-view consistency between adjacent perspectives. We propose the Fourier Cross-View Learning (FCVL) framework including Fourier Hierarchical Augmentation (FHiAug), an augmentation strategy in frequency domain to boost domain diversity and Fourier Cross-View Semantic Consistency Loss to facilitate the model to learn more domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees via augmentation graph theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore generalizable 3D Object Detection in BEV with single source data, and extensive experiments on various testing domains have demonstrated that our approach achieves the best performance on various test domains with single source data.",

I cannot think out a scenario that only a single domain of data can be used in practical applications.\n2. The presentation needs significant improvement. For example, the story flow of Intro is not fluent.\n3. The technique contributions, data augmentations in the frequency domain, are not very interesting. This is a somewhat straightforward idea. there are many attempts that design operations in the frequency domain, although maybe not in 3D object detection. However, these frequency-domain based methods are not really widely adopted after many years of research, and this work does not present a significant difference from them.\n4. The theoretical analysis seems not to add valuable information to this paper. Do not use mathematical formulations just because want to add mathematical formulations.
