    "title": "Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has proved to be a challenging task due to the in-\nherent variability of anomalous events and the scarcity of data available. Under the\ncommon Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only a video-level label\nis available during training, while the predictions are carried out at the frame-level.\nDespite decent progress on simple anomalous events (such as explosions), more\ncomplex real-world anomalies (such as shoplifting) remain challenging. There\nare two main reasons for this: (I) current state-of-the-art models do not address\nthe diversity between anomalies during training and process diverse categories\nof anomalies with a shared model, thereby ignoring the category-specific key at-\ntributes; and (II) the lack of precise temporal information (i.e., weak-supervision)\nlimits the ability to learn how to capture complex abnormal attributes that can\nblend with normal events, effectively allowing to use only the most abnormal snip-\npets of an anomaly. We hypothesize that these issues can be addressed by sharing\nthe task between multiple expert models that would increase the possibility of cor-\nrectly encoding the singular characteristics of different anomalies. Furthermore,\nmultiple Gaussian kernels can guide the experts towards a more comprehensive\nand complete representation of anomalous events, ensuring that each expert pre-\ncisely distinguishes between normal and abnormal events at the frame-level. To\nthis end, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE),\na novel approach that leverages a set of experts trained with a temporal Gaussian\nsplatting loss on specific classes of anomalous events and integrates their predic-\ntions via a mixture of expert models to capture complex relationships between\ndifferent anomalous patterns. The introduction of temporal Gaussian splatting\nloss allows the model to leverage temporal consistency in weakly-labeled data,\nenabling more robust identification of subtle anomalies over time. The novel loss\nfunction, designed to enhance weak supervision, further improves model perfor-\nmance by guiding expert networks to focus on segments of data with a higher like-\nlihood of containing anomalies. Experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-\nViolence datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves SOTA performance,\nscoring 91.58% AUC on UCF-Crime.",

However, in real-world \napplications, anomalies might not always fit neatly into predefined classes or could be ambiguous. \nThis assumption may restrict generalization to unseen or blended anomaly types, particularly in \nmore dynamic or less structured environments.\n3. The model relies heavily on the quality of extracted features from pre-trained I3D models. \nIf the feature extraction model underperforms or isn\u2019t well-suited to certain video types, the \noverall anomaly detection may suffer. The reliance on a fixed feature extractor may limit \nadaptability across datasets with different visual characteristics. \n4. The combination of Gaussian splatting with a mixture of experts might make it difficult to \ninterpret the model\u2019s decision-making process.

Since the peak detection process can significantly impact the quality of the rendered anomaly score, the final performance can be greatly affected by the initialization process, including the choice of task encoder and the hyperparameters used for peak detection. Conducting more ablation studies on these factors could demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.\n3. The author mentions that the MOE architecture learns class-specific representations. However, it is known that the differentiation between experts in MOE [2] of LLM is achieved through an additional loss function. I am curious about how different experts within the proposed framework learn to focus on different anomalies using only video-level labels.\n4. The ablation experiments for some important hyperparameters, such as $\\sigma_i$ in Equation (3) and the number of experts $N$, were missing from the paper.\n5. There are noun consistency issues in the paper, such as the use of \"TGS\" in Algorithm 1 and \"TSG\" in other parts of the paper.\n\n[1] Zhang H, Wang X, Xu X, et al.
