    "title": "Ger: Generation, Evaluation and Reflection Enhanced LLM for Knowledge Graph Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) involves answering natural language questions based on information provided by knowledge graphs. Large language models (LLMs), utilizing their exceptional natural language understanding capabilities and factual knowledge from knowledge graphs, have made some progress in KGQA reasoning. However, existing methods overlook the amplification of hallucinations in large language models caused by irrelevant information within vast knowledge graphs. This oversight leads to answers containing seemingly correct but unrelated responses, decreasing reliability. In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{\\textit{Generation-Evaluation-Reflection}} $ (Ger), an LLM-enhanced reflective reasoning framework for KGQA. The Ger mechanism introduces evaluation and reflection steps during the reasoning process, allowing LLMs to leverage the factual information in KGs better and utilize their logical reasoning strengths. This process reduces errors and hallucinations while improving reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ger enhances reasoning performance, providing more reliable and interpretable results, and achieves new state-of-the-art.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a GER (Generation-Evaluation-Reflection) framework for knowledge graph question answering. The authors\u2019 main argument is that the complex entities and relationships in KGs introduce irrelevant information, which further exacerbates the hallucination problem of LLMs. The paper\u2019s solution is to leverage three modules including generation, evaluation, and reflection. The evaluation module provides feedback to the answers and reasoning paths from the generation module, which are further referred by the reflection module to regenerate answers."

Importantly, it is widely recognized that scaling inference computes improves the models\u2019 performance in different ways. For example, https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314 concludes that sampling more answers for self-verifying is a straightforward way to scale up. Thus, comparing to related methods under similar computational burden may be necessary to support the advantage of the proposed model.\n\n(2) Generalization capability: the paper observes that fine-tuning on the WebQSP and CWQ training set yields improvement. I wonder if this result generalizes to other datasets. If the evaluation and reflection module achieve the general ability to judge the path correctness and provide feedback, there may be improvements on other few-shot datasets without a training set.\n\n(3) The presentation could be improved: in Section 4, training and inference details are missing for necessary reproduction for the proposed method."
