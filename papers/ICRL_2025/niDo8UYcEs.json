    "title": "XiEff Representation for Near-Field Optics",
    "abstract": "Near-field optics, or near-field electrodynamics, is a field that studies the interaction between materials and light at spatial scales smaller than the wavelength. At these extremely small scales, below the diffraction limit, the interaction between materials and electromagnetic fields can exhibit unique behaviors and properties not observed in conventional optics. This area of research is crucial for understanding the optical characteristics of nanotechnical systems and nanoscale biological objects. One of the primary tools used in near-field optics research is scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), which allows researchers to measure near-field optical images (NFI). However, these images often lack visual clarity and interpretability, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the properties of the probed particles.\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce a novel approach that addresses these challenges. Inspired by the prominent progress in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from computer vision and ideas from physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose an unsupervised method that introduces the XiEff representation \u2013 a neural field-based reparameterization of the effective susceptibility tensor. By integrating XiEff into the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation framework for near-field optics we develop an optimization strategy to reconstruct the effective susceptibility distribution directly from NFI data.\n\nThe optimized XiEff representation provides an interpretable and explainable model of the particle's shape. Extensive evaluations on a synthetically generated NFI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving high intersection-over-union scores between XiEff and ground truth shapes, even for complex geometries. Furthermore, the approach exhibits desirable robustness to measurement noise, a crucial property for practical applications. The XiEff representation, combined with the proposed optimization framework, potentially introduces a valuable tool for enabling explainable near-field optics imaging and enhancing the understanding of particle characteristics through interpretable representations",

Note, ICLR typically emphasizes novelty on the algorithmic side. Simply adopting an existing (and well-known) approach to a highly domain-specific problem (like the near-field imaging) would not be recommended for ICLR publication. \nI would suggest the authors further refine their paper, focus on the experiments (the experiments conducted in this paper are too toy to be attractive), and submit it to an optics/photonics journal for next-round evaluation. \nParticularly, a 3-D experimental setup with non-diagonal effective susceptibility would be interesting to be explored, in contrast to the 2D, diagnonal cases tested in the paper."

While the motivation is clear, the contribution is poor, with significant literature missing regarding the application of PINNs for inverse problems in nano-optics, as well as specific applications to SNOM data.\n\n**Clarity**  \n- The work would benefit from a dedicated Related Work section, which should discuss prior research on PINNs and their application in nano-optics optimization, as well as relevant papers on near-field optics.\n\n**Significance and Originality**  \n(-) The originality of this paper is limited, especially as it omits relevant literature on its proposed contribution. Notably, the foundational paper by Chen et al. (2020), \u201cPhysics-informed neural networks for inverse problems in nano-optics and metamaterials,\u201d is not discussed. Additionally, the paper specifically addressing this problem by Chen et al. (2022), \u201cPhysics-informed neural networks for imaging and parameter retrieval of photonic nanostructures from near-field data,\u201d is missing from the discussion. The 2020 paper has 500 citations, while the 2022 paper has 40 citations, making these omissions a critical oversight.\n\n**Results**  \n(-) By 2024, it is insufficient to present PINN-related work at a top conference using only 2D toy results, especially considering the breadth of related research. The authors should either address the failure modes of previous methods or propose a novel methodology with robust validation.\n\n**References:**  \n- Chen, Yuyao, et al. \"Physics-informed neural networks for inverse problems in nano-optics and metamaterials.\" *Optics Express*, 28.8 (2020): 11618-11633.  \n- Chen, Yuyao, and Luca Dal Negro. \"Physics-informed neural networks for imaging and parameter retrieval of photonic nanostructures from near-field data.\" *APL Photonics*, 7.1 (2022)."
