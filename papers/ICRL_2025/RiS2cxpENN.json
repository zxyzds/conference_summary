    "abstract": "We investigate what kind of images lie in the high-density regions of diffusion models. We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-probability sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.",

                "value": "1. *To use the assumption that the data is gaussian [...] results in incorrect results*\n\nWe would like to clarify further that we derive the mode-tracking ODE without assuming a Gaussian distribution (see Theorem 5). However, as discussed in lines 319-320, evaluating this ODE directly is computationally too costly in practice, so we opt to use an approximation. Specifically, while the simplified ODE (Equation 18) does not guarantee finding the mode, it allows us to evaluate the results empirically, as demonstrated in Section 4.3.\n\nThe purpose of Remark 1 is to illustrate that, under the assumption of a Gaussian data distribution, the simplified ODE (18) aligns with the optimal solution by naturally eliminating the troublesome higher-order terms. Although our data is not Gaussian, this simplification is appealing, so we apply the simplified ODE even in the non-Gaussian case to explore its empirical performance.\n\nWe believe that this reasoning is similar in spirit to the \"single-point\" distribution assumption (Appendix B.2 in [1]). In that work, the authors use the \"ideal derivative trick\" to derive parameters for the procedure under the assumption that the data distribution consists of a single point. They then empirically verify that this procedure performs well on real-world distributions, which consist of tens of thousands of points.\n\nSimilarly, we observe that when the data distribution is Gaussian, the troublesome higher-order terms vanish. Empirically, we find that even for non-Gaussian data, this approximation produces high-likelihood points, though not necessarily the exact modes, as would be guaranteed in the Gaussian case.\n\nWe would be happy to elaborate on this in the paper.\n\n5. *It is not true that diffusion models sample away from the high-likelihood regions.*\n\nWe take this opportunity to emphasize further that **in high dimensional distributions, samples are low-density by nature** and one always needs a special approach to obtain high-density points (which are not samples anymore). \nIn our paper, we demonstrate this in the context of diffusion, but the general phenomenon of \"typical\" samples not covering the highest likelihood regions is more widespread [2, 3].\n\n**The challenge was to design a procedure, which will find high likelihood samples and the qualitative analysis of these samples revealed surprising insights.**\nHowever, **the existence of samples with likelihoods higher than those of typical samples was to be expected and can be illustrated with an example below.**\n\nConsider the example of a Gaussian mixture.\nIt is informative because 1) it can approximate any distribution (given enough modes), and 2) we know exactly where the mode is (mean of the component with the highest weight).\nWe will consider a $D$-dimensional mixture with $K$ components of equal variance with the first component having the highest weight.\n\nConcretely: $p=\\sum_i^K w_i \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i, I_D)$, where $w_1=\\frac{2}{K+1}$ and $w_i=\\frac{1}{K + 1}$ for $i\\geq 2$;\nand $\\mu_i$ the $i$-th row of $I_D$, i.e. the $j$-th element of $\\mu_i$ is $\\delta_i^j$.\n\nWe now sample $N=8192$ points from that mixture, evaluate their loglikelihoods, and compare them with the loglikelihood of the mode ($\\mu_1$).\nFor $D=50$ and $K=8$, we find that the \"typical\" values of loglikelihoods are in the range $[-96.03, -55.07]$, whereas the loglikelihood of the mode is $-45.25$, which is clearly larger than the largest \"typical\" value.\n\nThe discrepancy grows as we increase the dimension $D$.\nFor example for $D=3 * 32 * 32$ (dimensionality corresponding to CIFAR10 images) and for a larger number of components $K=512$, the typical range of loglikelihood is $[-4490.378, -4237.26]$ and the loglikelihood of the mode is $-2822.286$.\nIn this case the difference between the loglikelihood of the mode and the highest typical value is over $5$ times larger than the difference between the highest and lowest typical values.\n\nWe hope that this additional example showed that it is not uncommon in high dimensional distributions that there exist high-likelihood points that are never sampled.\n**This also shows that there are no contradictions in our findings.** The cartoon-like or blurry images do have high likelihoods, but they are not \"typical\" and therefore do not appear in regular sampling.\n\nThank you for your feedback that has helped us clarify these aspects.\n\n---\n\n[1] Dockhorn et al. \"GENIE: Higher-Order Denoising Diffusion Solvers\" (NeurIPS 2022)\n\n[2] Nalisnick et al. \"Do deep generative models know what they don\u2019t know?\" (ICLR 2019)\n\n[3] Nalisnick et al. \"Detecting out-of-distribution inputs to deep generative models using typicality\" (arXiv:1906.02994)"

                "value": "We thank the Reviewer for their scrutiny of our work. We address the raised concerns below.\n\n1. *To use the assumption that the data is gaussian in order to use remark 1 results in incorrect results.*\n\nIn Remark 1 we show that HP-ODE generates the mode in the case of Gaussian data. For non-gaussian data we are no longer guaranteed to find the mode using HP-ODE, but in section 4.3 we empirically show that it generates points with higher likelihoods than regular samples.\n\n**We do not use the Gaussian assumption for real-world data experiments and we explicitly emphasize it in lines 349-351: \"Even though equation (18) finds the mode of $p(x_0|x_t)$ only in the Gaussian case [...], we will empirically show that even for non-Gaussian data it finds points with much higher likelihoods than regular samples.\"**\n\n2. *Specifically this ODE doesn't sample from the correct target distribution, and therefore we observe those cartoon like images.*\n\nIndeed, HP-ODE does not generate samples from the target distribution, which is evident is Figures 7 and 9. This was precisely the point of \"High probability\" seeking ODE: To find samples with larger likelihoods than those of regular samples.\n\nThis was the question we were exploring (see e.g. lines 028 or 290-291): What happens if we explicitly bias the sampler towards higher likelihood regions? Deviation from the data distribution was expected.\n\n3. *Additionally when comparing the likelihood of images sampled normally or from the HP-ODE the likelihoods were measured using different methods. In section 4.3 it is explained how they compute the likelihood of. Empirically they show that it results in higher likelihood than , however since these likelihoods are being evaluated in different ways this comparison doesn't make sense.*\n\nIndeed, we explain in section 4.3 that $p(y_0|x_t)$ is evaluated differently from $p(x_0|x_t)$. The sole reason for this is computational. We mention this briefly in a footnote (line 377), but are happy to elaborate on it.\n\nThe goal is to generate many samples $x_0 \\sim p(x_0|x_t)$ and for each $x_0$ compare $\\log p(x_0|x_t)$ with $\\log p(y_0|x_t)$. To generate diverse samples $x_0$ conditioned on the same $x_t$, the sampling needs to be done stochastically (deterministic PF-ODE sampling would always generate the same sample). As we show in Equation (20), the main computational challenge is estimating  $\\log p_0(x_0) - \\log p_t(x_t)$. Since $\\log p_0(x_0) - \\log p_t(x_t)=-\\int_0^t d \\log p_s(x_s)$, we can estimate it \"for free\" using Theorem 1.\n \n4. *If done correctly the sample would be evaluated using the same way as, so we would evaluate the likelihood of the same distribution and results would not be as reported.*\n\nThat said, we can estimate both $\\log p(y_0|x_t)$ and $\\log p(x_0|x_t)$ using the augmented probability flow ODE as is standard practice (albeit more expensive than our proposed approach).\n\n**Motivated by your concerns we now repeated the experiment** in Section 4.3 (Figure 7), but estimated both $\\log p(x_0|x_t)$ and $\\log p(y_0|x_t)$ using the same standard method, i.e. PF-ODE (equation 3). Specifically, we use PF-ODE to esimate $\\log p_0(x_0)$, $\\log p_0(y_0)$ and $\\log p_t(x_t)$ and use equation (20) to estimate $\\log p(y_0|x_t)$ and $\\log p(x_0|x_t)$.\n\n**The results are almost identical to the ones that we reported in the paper. The correlation between two different methods of estimation is at 0.998.** We again find that for all samples $x_0 \\sim p(x_0|x_t)$ we have $\\log p(x_0|x_t) < \\log p(y_0|x_t)$. This is to be expected, because (as we have shown in section 3.2) the difference between $\\log p$ estimation using our novel method (Theorem 1) and the standard approach (Equation 3) is very small. However, we chose to use our novel method, because it does not incur any additional cost unlike the standard approach.\n\n5. *Unfortunately the final conclusion of the paper is just incorrect. It is not true that diffusion models sample away from the high likelihood regions.*\n\nWe hope that the above explanations convinced you that our analysis in the paper does in fact demonstrate that regular diffusion model samples have lower likelihoods than 1) samples generated by HP-ODE (Figures 7 and 9); and blurry images (Figure 10).\n\n---\n\nMany thanks for the opportunity to clarify some key aspects of HP-ODE. We hope we have resolved all your concerns and would be grateful if this could be reflected in an improved score. If you have any further questions or concerns or suggestions, we are more than happy to address them."
