    "title": "Evaluating the Unseen: A Novel Framework for Assessing Unsupervised Concept Bottleneck Models",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained significant traction, with concept bottleneck models (CBMs) emerging as a promising approach to enhance the interpretability of machine learning systems. However, CBMs often rely on expert-annotated concepts, which can be costly and time-consuming to acquire. To address this limitation, unsupervised and label-free CBMs have been proposed, but these come with their own challenges, particularly in assessing the reliability and accuracy of the generated concepts without ground-truth labels. This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess the quality of explanations produced by unsupervised CBMs. Our framework comprises a set of novel metrics that evaluate various aspects of the concept outputs, including their relevance, consistency, and informativeness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics through a series of experiments, showing certain positive correlations between our scores and both LLM evaluations and human judgments. Our work not only fills a critical gap in the evaluation of unsupervised CBMs but also provides a solid foundation for further research into more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.",

                "value": "This paper suffers from a conceptual fallacy:\n\nit states to analyze the usefulness of extracted concepts for a prediction task (see below the abstract states) which relies on a concatenation of two mappings, g and f (lines 150-154), but the proposed evaluation methods do not use in any way the mapping f which performs the prediction task. \n\nIt makes the assumption that LLMs and humans would use the extracted/predicted concepts c in the same way as f does (or that longclip acts similar to g). That is the fallacy.\n\nIf f performs a low level vision task, like extracting parts with unusual optical flow, or parts with adversarial statistics, then it will not use the same high level semantics as longclip, gpt or humans. \nOther examples can be made, also with divergent high level semantics, for example when creating synthetised reasoning tasks, or more concretely a movie where a bird is symbolizing upcoming demise and thus is labeled correctly as \"yellow doombringer\".\n\nIn a high level summary, the paper measures aspects of alignment between the extracted concepts and longclip/ LLMs / humans, but a low score does not indicate any lack of usefulness or importance of any sort for the mapping f(g(x)). \n\nthe abstract states:\n\n\"This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework\ndesigned to assess the quality of explanations produced by unsupervised CBMs.\"\n\n\"Our framework comprises a set of novel metrics that evaluate various aspects of\nthe concept outputs, including their relevance, consistency, and informativeness.\"\n\nThe quality is not measured with respect to the mapping for which they are used.\nThe relevance and informativeness is not measured with respect to the mapping for which they are used. \n\n\ncontribution 1 in line 073/074 states:  \"We propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for unsupervised CBMs, incorporating a range of metrics tailored to assess concept quality from multiple angles.\"\n \nThe evaluation does not measure concept quality with respect to the task at hand and the trained mapping at hand.\n\nThe paper cannot be accepted without completely removing such misleading claims.\nAs such the paper is a clear reject.\n\nThe above big issue is the reason for a very low score in soundness.\n\n\nThe NLP evaluation makes somewhat sense, however similarities on word level between predicted and ground truth concepts are not very novel and straightforward if one has ground truth concepts available. \n\nminor points:\n\nConcretely, eq. 1 relies on a similarity between the image and the concepts as measured by longclip. That might work out for some tasks with similar semantics like fine grained classification, but there is no step taken to align eq1 to the mapping g. No measurement is done whether g acts in any way similar to Longclip.\n\neq. 2 has a flaw as well:\neq. 2 uses a harmonic mean between two similarities. One of them is computed from a similarity between embedded predicted and ground truth concepts. The harmonic mean is dominated by lower scores. That means, that if the predicted textual concept is close to the ground truth concept, but the similarity to the image is low, one will get a low score, while one should get a high score instead."

While the paper clearly position itself for non-supervised methods, the related work and the experiments review and employ i) supervised methods that either the train concept layer together with the rest of the network (CBM, CEM) or after (Post-hoc CBM), ii) LLM-based CBMs utilizing VLMs to provide concept annotations. No actual unsupervised methods are reported such as [1,2,3,4]. Thus, I only see two possibilities: either the authors reframe the proposed framework to evaluate supervised or LLM-based concept bottleneck models, or they integrate actual unsupervised CBM models in the evaluation and in the related work.\n- **Related work**: while providing novel interesting metrics for studying and evaluating CBMs, the authors should also tell thy these metrics are required and why existing metrics are not sufficient to represent the same information. Among other papers, the authors could take a look at [5] which provides several metrics to evaluate concept representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. \n- **Result presentation**: The result presentation is very confusing and below the standard of the conference. Prompt1 is never defined. Several results are report within the text without specifying for which model they have been computed. No standard deviation is provided.\n\n[1] Dai, Enyan, and Suhang Wang. \"Towards self-explainable graph neural network.\" Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management. 2021.\n\n[2] Wang, Bowen, et al. \"Learning bottleneck concepts in image classification.\" Proceedings of the ieee/cvf conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2023.\n\n[3] Chen, Chaofan, et al. \"This looks like that: deep learning for interpretable image recognition.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n\n[4] Rajagopal, Dheeraj, et al. \"SELFEXPLAIN: A Self-Explaining Architecture for Neural Text Classifiers.\" Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. 2021.\n\n[5] Zarlenga, Mateo Espinosa, et al. \"Towards robust metrics for concept representation evaluation.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

It is not very clear: as it gives more weight to lower values, a single low ConceptScore should dominate the overall evaluation, right?\n- Ref-Concept score: it is not clear the notation used to define the concept ground truth in Equation 2-3. In general the way in which the concepts are encoded in a prompt is unclear, an example would have improved the understanding. It is also unclear while there are 2 equations.\n- It is not clear in section 3.4 how the author consider concept predictions and labels in the NLP contexts.\n- Section 3.5 is very badly written: the human score is not defined at all, there is no indication of the actual rating provided by humans nor how they should assign it.\n- No standard deviation reported for any metric in the experiments."
