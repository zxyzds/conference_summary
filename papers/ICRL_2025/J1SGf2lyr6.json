    "title": "A Feature-Aware Federated Learning Framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in 5G Networks",
    "abstract": "The expansion of 5G networks has led to remarkable data volume and complexity, introducing significant security challenges that require the implementation of robust and scalable anomaly detection mechanisms. Traditional centralized approaches pose privacy risks and scalability challenges due to the distributed nature of 5G infrastructures. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution but often overlooks the importance of feature relevance and privacy preservation during model aggregation. This paper introduces a novel Feature-Aware Federated framework that integrates feature importance into the aggregation process while ensuring differential privacy. We employ integrated gradients to compute feature importance for each client, aggregate them globally with differential privacy noise, and use these insights to weight model parameters during aggregation. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Feature Importance Adaptation (DFIA) to update feature importance occasionally, enhancing the model's adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional federated approaches like FedAvg and FedProx in unsupervised anomaly detection tasks within 5G networks, achieving higher accuracy and robustness while preserving data privacy.",

                "value": "- The writing style of this paper suggests it may have been generated by an LLM, as it includes many informal expressions that are uncommon in academic manuscripts. It is recommended that the authors thoroughly review the language and expressions used throughout the text.\n\n- The novelty of this paper needs further strengthening. Currently, the approach mainly combines existing techniques\u2014feature-aware aggregation and differential privacy\u2014without a clear distinction from previous works. The authors should further elaborate on the differences and connections between their proposed method and related work to emphasize its unique contributions.\n\n- The paper should include more advanced baselines. In the experimental results, the authors compare only with FedProx and omit comparisons with existing advanced FL-based anomaly detection baselines, which limits the ability to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.\n\n- The accuracy of the experimental results needs further explanation. Introducing DP mechanisms typically results in a decrease in model accuracy, yet the results in this paper do not reflect this and even exceed FedAvg. Additionally, the paper should provide a detailed description of experimental settings, including learning rate, dataset size, training rounds, and other hyperparameters. Ablation experiments should be conducted to clarify the contribution of each individual component, which will aid readers in understanding the impact of each on the method's performance.\n\n- Finally, the experimental results lack persuasiveness in terms of baselines, dataset size, dataset configurations, and parameter sensitivity analysis. The authors should consider conducting additional experiments to enhance the credibility of the experimental findings."

There is already a substantial body of work focused on heterogeneous data and features in FL, but the authors only mention the classic approaches, FedAvg and FedProx.\n\n2. The experiments are lacking. The authors only use the two aforementioned methods as baselines and conduct a limited number of experiments. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to details about model architecture.\n\n3. The paper lacks motivation. Why do we need a feature weighting method instead of letting the model learn it? It would be better if the necessity of this method in certain scenarios could be clarified.\n\n4. In the introduction, it\u2019s stated: \"this (FedAvg\u2019s) assumption overlooks the heterogeneity inherent in client data,\" which suggests that the 5G scenario involves non-i.i.d data. However, the authors' method directly averages the 'feature importance vectors' from different clients (Eq.5). The rationale behind this step doesn\u2019t seem intuitive.\n\n5. Eq.10 seems incorrect. Since \\theta_k is a vector representing the model parameters, this implies that w_k should also be a vector. Meanwhile, \\Sigma a_i doesn\u2019t appear to make sense. The unclear nature of this formula makes it difficult to fully understand the proposed method."
