    "title": "Calibrating Video Watch-time Predictions with Credible Prototype Alignment",
    "abstract": "Accurately predicting user watch-time is crucial for enhancing user stickiness and retention in video recommendation systems. Existing watch-time prediction approaches typically involve transformations of watch-time labels for prediction and subsequent reversal, ignoring both the natural distribution properties of label and the \\textit{instance representation confusion} that results in inaccurate predictions. \nIn this paper, we propose ProWTP, a two-stage method combining prototype learning and optimal transport for watch-time regression prediction, suitable for any deep recommendation model. The core idea of ProWTP is to align label distribution with instance representation distribution to calibrate the instance space, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Specifically, we observe that the watch-ratio (the ratio of watch-time to video duration) within the same duration bucket exhibits a multimodal distribution. To facilitate incorporation into models, we use a hierarchical vector quantised variational autoencoder (HVQ-VAE) to convert the continuous label distribution into a high-dimensional discrete distribution, serving as credible prototypes for calibrations. Based on this, ProWTP views the alignment between prototypes and instance representations as a Semi-relaxed Unbalanced Optimal Transport (SUOT) problem, where the marginal constraints of prototypes are relaxed. And the corresponding optimization problem is reformulated as a weighted Lasso problem for solution. Moreover, ProWTP introduces the assignment and compactness losses to encourage instances to cluster closely around their respective prototypes, thereby enhancing the prototype-level distinguishability. Finally, we conducted extensive offline experiments on two industrial datasets, demonstrating our consistent superiority in real-world application.",

                "value": "I think the paper has the following major limitations that could be addressed to further improve its quality:\n1. The proposed approach is novel and unique, having never been used for watch time prediction. However, the paper lacks a clear motivation for why such an approach is necessary. For example, in existing work like D2Q, the authors highlight the duration bias problem, which motivates their approach. In contrast, this paper states, 'However, those methods struggle to consistently maintain high predictive accuracy across different models,' but the proposed approach seems to address a different problem (duration bias versus distribution alignment). The authors are suggested to improve the motivation for their approach.\n2. he paper lacks a comprehensive review of existing research on watch time prediction and misses some important citations below. Specifically, the authors claim, 'We investigate the multimodal distribution properties of watch-ratio across different video duration buckets for the first time,' but the bimodal distribution nature of KuaiRand was studied in Zhao et al., 2023. \n    + Zhao et al., 2023, Uncovering User Interest from Biased and Noised Watch Time in Video Recommendation\n    + Zheng et al., 2022. DVR: Micro-Video Recommendation Optimizing Watch-Time-Gain under Duration Bias\n    + Zhao et al., 2024, Counteracting Duration Bias in Video Recommendation via Counterfactual Watch Time\n3. It is not clear why aligning the feature space and the obtained prototype vectors via optimal transport helps with watch time prediction. Are there any simpler methods that could achieve similar results? The authors are suggested to clarify why optimal transport is chosen and how it specifically benefits the prediction task.\n3. The proposed method includes three separate loss functions in Equations 9, 11, and 12. However, it is not clear how these losses are combined for final training. Additionally, it is unclear why the final task loss uses prototype vectors as predictions instead of instance representations h. The authors are suggested to provide more clarity on these aspects."

The following sentence repeats twice in the related work. \"D2Q alleviates the duration bias by conducting backdoor adjustments and models watch time with direct watch-time quantile regression. \"\n2. The authors highlight, \"However, those methods struggle to consistently maintain high predictive accuracy across different models.\" Could you provide more detailed explanations for why existing methods cannot maintain high predictive accuracy across different models?\n3. Regarding the sampling in the pre-processing step, the process of transforming original one-dimensional multimodal distributions into D \u2217 L one-dimensional near-Gaussian distributions w of length needs further clarfirication. Please provide a clear description of how the data is sampled and transformed.\n4. The computation for optimal transport is expensive. Although the authors reduce the computational cost by randomly sampling 20% of the instances in a batch, could you please provide the trade-off numbers between effectiveness and efficiency? Specifically, how much does this reduction in computational cost impact the model's performance?"

                "value": "This paper introduces ProWTP, a two-stage framework for watch-time prediction. In the first stage, ProWTP employs HVQ-VAE to capture clustering structures among instances based on watch ratios. In the second stage, ProWTP uses SUOT to refine instance representations to align with the learned clusters.\nProWTP is validated in the offline evaluation. ProWTP shows improvement over baseline methods on two benchmark datasets. The ablation study also shows the effectiveness of various design choices within the framework.\n\nThe reviewer primarily has the following concerns regarding the presentation and experiments of this work.\n1. For Figure 1a, to the reviewer, it is unclear whether the watch-ratio distribution for videos of short and medium durations is truly multimodal, as the density of the first peak (around 1.5 for medium-duration videos) does not appear significant.\n2. As presented in Section 4.2, ProWTP samples a one-dimensional distribution $w$ from the multimodal distribution and claims this distribution should be near-Gaussian. However, to the reviewer, with random sampling alone, $w$ may not exhibit a near-Gaussian form. The authors are encouraged to elaborate further on any specific sampling strategies employed to achieve this distribution.\n3. The prototype generation process remains unclear. Specifically, does the encoder use individual watch ratios or the entire distribution as input? If it uses the distribution, does this imply that the HVA-VAE is trained on a single sample, as the reviewer assumes there is one distribution for the entire dataset?\n4. The instance representation confusion issue is not intuitive and well-defined.\n5. In Section 4.3, further elaboration is needed on why both the instance representation distribution and the prototype representation distribution follow a uniform distribution.\n6. To the reviewer, the improvement over baselines on the two datasets appears marginal, suggesting the need to test the significance of these improvements. Additionally, while the authors adopt the parameter settings from the original papers for baselines, these models may not be optimized for the MLP architecture used here, potentially making the settings sub-optimal. The authors are thus encouraged to search for optimal baseline parameters to ensure a fair comparison.\n7. The authors are encouraged to include an online evaluation to better validate ProWTP\u2019s effectiveness with real users.\n8. No empirical results demonstrate whether the representation confusion issue has been addressed.\n9. The trend in Table 3 raises concerns for the reviewer. If there is a clustering structure in the data that benefits watch-time prediction, as suggested in the other tables, why does k-means underperform random?\n10. The literature review overlooks a recent work for watch-time prediction [1], which is closely related to this work.\n\n[1] SWaT: Statistical Modeling of Video Watch Time through User Behavior Analysis"
