    "title": "Fantastic Copyrighted Beasts and How (Not) to Generate Them",
    "abstract": "Recent studies show that image and video generation models can be prompted to reproduce copyrighted content from their training data, raising serious legal concerns about copyright infringement. Copyrighted characters (e.g., Mario, Batman) present a significant challenge: at least one lawsuit has already awarded damages based on the generation of such characters. Consequently, commercial services like DALL\u00b7E have started deploying interventions.\nHowever, little research has systematically examined these problems: (1) Can users easily prompt models to generate copyrighted characters, even if it is unintentional?; (2) How effective are the existing mitigation strategies?\nTo address these questions, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with metrics that assess both the generated image\u2019s similarity to copyrighted characters and its consistency with user intent, grounded in a set of popular copyrighted characters from diverse studios and regions.\nWe show that state-of-the-art image and video generation models can still generate characters even if characters' names are not explicitly mentioned, sometimes with only two generic keywords (e.g., prompting with ``videogame, plumber'' consistently generates Nintendo's Mario character). \nWe also introduce semi-automatic techniques to identify such keywords or descriptions that trigger character generation. Within this framework, we study the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, including both existing methods and new strategies we propose. Our findings reveal that commonly used strategies, such as prompt rewriting in DALL\u00b7E, are insufficient as standalone guardrails. These strategies need to be supplemented with other approaches, such as negative prompting, to effectively reduce the unintended generation of copyrighted characters. Our work provides empirical grounding for discussions on copyright mitigation strategies and offers actionable insights for model deployers implementing these safeguards.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the issue of copyright violation in image or video generation from text. More specifically, it explores empirically which Prompting techniques can be used to avoid regenerating visual content that was part of these systems' training base (e.g. for Diffusion Systems). It investigates the risk of accidental copyrighted content generation from user Prompts in order to develop mitigating strategies.\nExperimenting with four image generation (Playground v2.5, Stable Diffusion XL, PixArt-\u03b1, DeepFloyd IF) and one video generation (VideoFusion) systems, the authors evaluate the following mitigation strategies: 1) using prompt rewriting only, 2) using negative prompts only, and 3) combining negative prompts and prompt rewriting. The authors develop two specific metrics (DETECT and CONS) measuring copyrighted character generation and consistency with user intent, to assess intervention performance and lack of side-effects. Based on this metrics they report positive results for their approach, in some cases reducing copyright infringement from 30% to 5%."

The research questions (Q1/Q2) are clearly formulated, and the empirical metrics developed are well-aligned to these questions. Consistency via the VQAS score is an important addition to the method. \nDespite its empirical stance, the paper is rather rigorous on the technical aspects, which includes an extensive choice of image generation systems, an examination of training corpora, including captions from image-captioning datasets. \nThe presentation of results in Table I and Table II is detailed and convincing, with potentially a 7-fold decrease in copyrighted character detection. \nThere is a comprehensive section on supplementary material giving additional technical details (although sometimes difficult to distinguish in nature from the paper itself). Moreover, including a self-contained, yet technically relevant, legal perspective will no doubt be a great use to the readers."

Despite aligning to terminologies consistent with our area of research, I imagine that the manuscript's writing style and depth would allow many types of stakeholders beyond ICLR's more technical community (e.g., software engineers with limited machine learning experience) to engage with it. \n\n## 2. Evaluation Depth and Methodological Rigor\nThe paper's presented relies on methodological rigor to conduct a through examination of the phenomenon of copyright character generation. I found the authors' choice of methods, metrics, and datasets to be appropriate. One might argue that the methods described and employed in portions of their Appendix are prominent enough to be their own contributions.\n\n## 3. Practical Motivation and Commit to Reproducibility\nThe paper's motivation is thematically oriented toward model use in practice and consumer reproducibiltiy, which makes aspects of the paper (e.g the Discussion) have a rather unique feel."

                "value": "My concerns with the paper are primarily related to its positioning and contribution with respect to prior work in related areas. Below, I highlight three key concerns:\n\n## 1. Weak Connection to Jailbreaking and Red Teaming\nThe paper is motivated by two key questions that related to the generation of copyrighted characters and mitigation strategies against attempts at such generation. I find this conceptually identically to the challenge of jailbreaking, yet the authors appear to have explicitly chosen to differentiate the two (e.g., See: L871 for the sole reference to jailbreaking). There is a wide array of preexisting work related to jailbreaking LLMs and a growing body of literature on jailbreaking MLLMs (e.g., Ma et al.). I'm perplexed with the connection with this area of research is weak.\n\nMa et al. \u201cVisual-RolePlay: Universal Jailbreak Attack on MultiModal Large Language Models via Role-playing Image Characte.\u201d ArXiv abs/2405.20773 (2024): n. pag.\n\n## 2. Narrow Scope of Semi-Automatic Techniques: Prompt Rewriting\nI found the scope of semi-automatic techniques (i.e. on prompt rewriting) to be quite thin in its novelty. As the authors note, prompt rewriting is a well-established technique both within text-to-image models and beyond it. There are a large number of techniques (i.e., from studies related to jailbreaking and red teaming) that go beyond prompt rewriting (e.g. Yang et al's token perturbation approach). \n\nYang et al. \u201cSneakyPrompt: Jailbreaking Text-to-image Generative Models.\u201d 2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP) (2023): 897-912.\n\n## 3. Relevance to \"Debiasing\" Generative Models\nThe phenomenon of copyrighted characters being generated on the basis of indirect anchoring can be viewed and understood as a form of generative bias. There are prior works (e.g. He et al.) that have studied techniques for debiasing text-to-image models in similar ways. \n\nHe et al. In Proceedings of the 1st ACM Multimedia Workshop on Multi-modal Misinformation Governance in the Era of Foundation Models (MIS '24). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 29\u201336. https://doi.org/10.1145/3689090.3689387\n\n## 4. Significance and Contribution\nAmid the other weaknesses, I find myself asking if the authors' motivating statement remains true. There exists a need to revisit the significance and contribution of the work and provide an explicit statement regarding the novelty and significance of the conducted work."

                "value": "I see two key problems with this paper which, for me, warrant it not to be accepted.\n\nFirst, the authors use GPT-4V as the evaluator of their images. According to the appendix, the accuracy is only 82.5%, and the Kappa agreement with humans is merely 0.65. There are also problems with the methodology used in the human evaluation, but even dis-considering this problem, this characterizes as a quite flawed metric: it incorrectly evaluates 1 in 5 of images. This is never mentioned in the main paper, I had to dig through the appendixes to find it, and makes all the results questionable. Many of the differences depicted in figure 3 are indistinguishable if we consider an interval of plus/minus 20% of confidence in the metric. Similarly, all results in tables 1 and 2 are virtually identical if we consider that the metric has, at minimum, 20% of error. In other words, almost all of the results presented in the paper are not valid when we consider the problems with the metric.\n\nSecond, the presentation of the results of the study is improperly done. The baseline result of the paper, when character names are used, is described as \"not too surprisingly, we have verified that when using character names, ~60% of tested characters can be generated.\" How does this break down among engines? A table describing the results would be nice (I tried to find in the appendix, but could not, if it is there please point specifically). Similarly, what the results are for 60-word and other indirect methods.\n\nThe latter problem can be fixed by better writing, but the former cannot without redesigning and redoing the study. That is the reason I recommend rejection of this paper."

The alternative question \"Is the generated characters so similar as to be recognized as an existing copyrighted character?\" seems sufficient in a vacuum, however, does not account for peoples' satellite knowledge and potential misconceptions regarding the characters. Beyond just a binary rating on whether a character resembles another in the human evaluation, the confidence of the human evaluator in that evaluation also seems important.\n\nThe character pool also seems somewhat small and arbitrarily chosen. While they are definitely popular and trademarked characters (I myself recognize most of them), it would be nice if the authors could provide some concrete metric to ensure these are not just characters well known to those in the CS-field."

Could this be considered a form of data leakage, and if so, what was the extent?\n\n2.) How were the 50 diverse copyrighted characters chosen?\n\n3.) Is there an available source for the claim that DALL.E leverages prompt rewriting? (Completely understand if this is not published but a citation here would be ideal)\n\n4.) I'm a bit confused about negative prompts. My understanding is that this is just an instruction to avoid generating images that fit the description of the negative prompt, is this correct? \n\n5.)
