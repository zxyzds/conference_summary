    "title": "FGW-CLIP: Enhancing Enzyme Screening via Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Enzymes are crucial catalysts for biochemical reactions, underpinning numerous biological processes. The efficient identification of specific enzymes from extensive protein libraries is essential for understanding and harnessing these biological reactions. While traditional computational methods for enzyme screening are time-consuming and resource-intensive, recent contrastive learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods often overlook the inherent hierarchical classifications within enzymes and reactions, as well as the significance of molecular structure in catalysis. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This approach incorporates multiple alignments, including representation alignment between reactions and enzymes, and internal alignment within enzyme and reaction representations. By introducing a regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, enhancing information exchange within these domains. FGW-CLIP demonstrates superior performance on the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods in enzyme virtual screening tasks. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both BEDROC and EF metrics, indicating its efficacy in identifying relevant enzymes for given reactions. These results highlight the potential of our method to advance virtual enzyme screening, offering a powerful tool for enzyme discovery and characterization.",

                "value": "The paper presents an enhanced contrastive learning framework for enzyme screening, distinguishing itself from prior work [1] through two significant advancements: 1. The author adopted the pre-trained, transformer-based Uni-Mol framework to generate the representations of the 3D molecules. 2. The author proposed a fused loss function L_{FGW} that integrates multiple alignments, including reaction-enzyme alignment (Eq. 1), internal alignments for both enzyme and reaction (Eq.2), as well as regularization terms for minimizing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between embedding spaces. \n\nIn the experimental results, Table 3 highlights the method '{R-E},' which shows a marginal improvement in the Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination of ROC scores when employing the 3D-based Uni-Mol framework as opposed to the 2D-based directed message-passing neural network (DMPNN) for reaction encoding. Table 1 demonstrates the overall improvement in performance in adopting the FGW-CLIP framework."

                "value": "The novelty of this paper appears limited. It conducts minor modifications on pre-existing frameworks [1]. Regardless of the novelty, one significant drawback/question of this paper is: in [1], table 1: \u2018Enzyme virtual screening performance compared to using EC prediction alone and together with CLIPZyme\u2019 reports that the BEDROC85 score can increase from 44.69 to 57.03, and the BEDROC20 increase from 62.98 to 78.50, even with basic information EC level information, which I believe is the major contribution of the previous framework. This paper, however, fails to discuss and conduct experiments on this part. In addition, in section 3.3.2, equation 4 incorporates multi-level classification loss, L_{EC}, as one of the fused loss L_{FGW} contributions. This indicates that the ground truth of EC level is known. I am wondering whether the author can further clarify this part.\n\nThe authors state that the experimental settings were aligned with those reported in [1]. However, the number of protein sequences used in the Enzyme Screening set appears to differ from those reported in [1]. Could the authors clarify if this difference is due to a typographical error or if adjustments were made to the dataset? In addition, it is better to include the training details in optimizing L_{FGW}. E.g., which optimizer is used, how it is set up, and how the regularization term \\lambda is chosen.\n\nIt is better to provide a detailed description of Figure 2. E.g., include a legend of the figure.\n\n---\n\n[1] Mikhael, Peter G., Itamar Chinn, and Regina Barzilay. \"CLIPZyme: Reaction-Conditioned Virtual Screening of Enzymes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.06748 (2024)."

This has a positive effect on the measured metrics. \n2. The authors note that adding an auxiliary EC loss improves performance -- this makes sense and indeed it does.\n3. The authors apply a novel FGW loss that aims to minimize the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the enzyme and reaction spaces -- this is a novel method that has not before been applied to these problems (to the best of my knowledge).\n4.

                "value": "There are a number of weaknesses in the paper:\n1. The evaluation setup compares FGW-CLIP to CLIPZyme, yet since the publication of CLIPZyme two new benchmarking papers have been released that provide a comprehensive evaluation setup on this task: Yang et al (CARE: a Benchmark Suite for the Classification and\nRetrieval of Enzymes) and Hua et al (ReactZyme: A Benchmark for Enzyme-Reaction Prediction). CREEP (in Yang et al) also includes auxiliary tasks as a part of the model and shows improvement. Please provide results comparing your model to more recent models on this task.\n2. The paper excludes additional benchmarks provided in the original CLIPZyme paper, such as performance on sequence and structure similarity splits of the screening set, unannotated EnzymeMap and Terpene Synthases. \n3. Ablation study -- it is difficult to interpret the ablation study since components of the loss do not seem to be additive to the performance. For example why is BEDROC-85 R_E + R_R better than all other methods except for FGW-CLIP? This seems strange. Additionally, how much of the performance gain is attributed to using different encoders compared to a different loss? How does the CLIPZyme architecture perform with the FGW loss? \n4. Please provide additional analysis to explain the performance difference and its significance. The BEDROC values represent an experimental screening setup of 10,000 proteins which is not a realistic budget -- how does FGW-CLIP do on 1,000 proteins? \n5. Please provide tsne plots that show groups that the model was not trained on -- it is not completely surprising that the representations of FGW-CLIP cluster by EC since it was trained to do that while CLIPZyme was not. What do the representations look like if we cluster by sequence similarity, structure similarity or reaction similarity? What can we learn from these plots?"

Perhaps provide qualitative results for a number of different reactions (across different EC classes for example) showing what screening budget would be needed with FGW-CLIP vs CLIPZyme\n2. What impact does changing the encoders have as compared to the losses? Compare your losses with different architectures to show that the loss is what is driving the performance.\n3. Why do you think that the 3D unimol representations are better than alternative representations? Since presumably the 3D conformers are random (since they do not exist in EnzymeMap) -- the 3D information is largely irrelevant? Could it be that there is leakage between the training molecules and the molecules that UniMol is trained on?"
