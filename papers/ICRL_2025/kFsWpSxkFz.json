    "title": "MetaUrban: An Embodied AI Simulation Platform for Urban Micromobility",
    "abstract": "Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. **Micromobility** enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present **MetaUrban**, a *compositional* simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an *infinite* number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents\u2019 appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities. The code and dataset will be publicly available.",

                "value": "The paper introduces MetaUrban, a simulation platform designed to support AI research for urban micromobility, focusing on autonomous systems navigating shared public spaces like streets and plazas. Unlike other platforms tailored for indoor or vehicle-based simulations, MetaUrban enables the development and testing of AI in complex urban environments. It includes diverse urban scenes, populated with obstacles, dynamic agents (like pedestrians and cyclists), and varied terrain. It has a compositional structure that allows for unbounded variations built upon its compositional elements.\n\nThe paper goes through various elements of MetaUrban:\n- Hierarchical Layout Generation: This feature supports scalable scene generation, allowing the creation of realistic urban environments with complex layouts, functional zones on sidewalks, and varied terrains.\n- Scalable Obstacle Retrieval: The platform uses real-world data to model the distribution of obstacles commonly found in urban settings and retrieves relevant 3D assets through vision-language models. This ensures that the simulation incorporates diverse, realistic objects to improve the generalizability of trained agents.\n- Cohabitant Populating: MetaUrban models dynamic interactions by simulating various agents, including pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, with a range of movements and trajectories. This feature supports complex interaction scenarios, enhancing the safety testing of mobile AI agents.\n- MetaUrban-12k, -unseen, and -finetune for training, testing, and finetuning - elements are action sequences in environments\n\nThe paper then reports the results of baseline experiments on MetaUrban. There are two primary tasks: Point Navigation (navigating to a target in static environments) and Social Navigation (reaching a destination while avoiding collisions with moving agents). Success was evaluated using metrics like Success Rate (SR), Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), Cumulative Cost (CC), and Social Navigation Score (SNS). Seven baseline models, including variations of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning, demonstrated that tasks were complex, with maximum success rates of 66% for PointNav and 36% for SocialNav. Generalizability tests showed that models trained on MetaUrban-12K adapted to unseen environments with moderate success rates (41% for PointNav and 26% for SocialNav). Evaluations of different mobile machines highlighted that mechanical structures, such as speed and steering, significantly impacted performance; conservative designs improved safety but could hinder mobility. Ablation studies confirmed that increasing training data enhanced agent performance and that higher densities of static and dynamic obstacles posed greater challenges for successful navigation."

Unlike existing simulators, MetaUrban simulates agents in urban environments while navigating along paths, sidewalks, etc. This is different from existing simulators that either focus on indoor navigation or urban driving.\n\nEnvironments are procedurally generated. The procedure begins by first generating a ground plan that specifies where roads will be, sidewalks, crosswalks, etc. Then terrain and objects are added. To determine what objects to add to a given scene, the authors propose to use real-world urban object distributions and design a pipeline towards this end.\n\nFinally, other dynamic agents are added to the scene, such as humans, vehicle, and other robots. Trajectories are created for these agents using the ORCA social forces model and the push and rotate algorithm to resolve deadlocks.\n\nThe authors then evaluate RL, IL, and Offline RL methods on two tasks, PointNav and SocialNav."

RGB rendering is, at best, 65 FPS, which is orders of magnitude lower than would be ideal and at least an order of magnitude lower than would be \"good\".\n\nI encourage the authors to see if there are features that can be turned off for the sake of performance if researches want to make that trade-off. For instance, can visual fidelity be reduced (by disabling things like shadows), or can animations be disabled to increase performance?\n\nI see the value of including these features for sake of full-fledged evaluation, but these may not be necessary for training and are likely not needed for initial experiments."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main goal of such a large-scale simulator is to eventually transfer learned models to the real world. However, there is limited experimentation with real robots, and details on how well models trained in the simulator generalize to real-world sensor data are unclear. More real-world testing is necessary to demonstrate effective transferability.\n\n2. The paper does not specify if robots, pedestrians, and other mobility devices can be controlled via standard interfaces like ROS. Without ROS integration, robotics users may need to modify their software pipelines, limiting the platform's usability. This lack of integration would also hinder the deployment of trained models onto real robots, making the simulator less practical for real-world robotics applications.\n\n3. It is unclear how the simulator synchronizes with model updates during benchmarking. If the simulator runs ahead of model updates, this could lead to model decisions being applied to future time steps, potentially reducing the accuracy of training and evaluation. A more detailed explanation of time synchronization between the simulator and model updates is necessary to ensure the integrity of the training process.\n\n4. While pedestrian behavior is simulated, there is little exploration of how AI models handle complex, unpredictable social interactions. Expanding evaluations in this area would improve the relevance of the social navigation task.\n\n5. The paper does not fully explore the performance impact of different sensor configurations (e.g., lidar, cameras). A detailed comparison of sensor types would provide practical guidance for applying models to real-world scenarios.\n\n6. The paper does not mention if the simulator can run in distributed systems or scale across multiple machines. Also can the simulator run in headless mode so that it can be scalably deployed on a cluster. Can the simulator run faster than real time to make model training and evaluation quicker.\n\n7. The paper does not discuss how environmental factors like weather or lighting conditions (day/night) are handled.\n\n8. The platform includes dynamic agents but does not explore multi-agent coordination, competition, or collaboration. More emphasis on multi-agent learning and interactions could make the simulator useful for tasks involving coordination among multiple robots or agents."
