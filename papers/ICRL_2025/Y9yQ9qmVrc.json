    "title": "scKGOT: Intercellular Signaling Inference with Knowledge Graph Optimal Transport for Single-cell Transcriptomics",
    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics provides detailed genetic insights into cellular heterogeneity within intact organs and the intercellular signaling that underpins tissue homeostasis, development, and disease. To improve the inference of intercellular signaling and pathway activity, we introduce scKGOT, a novel method that employs the Knowledge Graph Optimal Transport (KGOT) algorithm to model and quantify ligand-receptor-signaling networks between sender and receiver cells. scKGOT defines sender and receiver spaces using pairwise distance matrices from gene expression profiles and leverages prior knowledge from the Ligand-Receptor-Pathway Knowledge Graph (LRP-KG) as initial guidance for transport optimization, allowing for dynamic adaptation based on gene expression data. Through comprehensive benchmarking on public single-cell transcriptomic datasets, scKGOT consistently outperforms existing inference methods in terms of precision and interpretability. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability across multiple case studies, uncovering complex pathway interactions and revealing insights into cellular heterogeneity in diverse biological contexts. By incorporating scKGOT, we provide a robust and generalizable approach for pathway inference in single-cell analyses, advancing the understanding of intercellular communication mechanisms and offering valuable insights into biological processes at the cellular level.",

                "value": "In this manuscript, the authors present scKGOT, a novel computational method that leverages Knowledge Graph Optimal Transport algorithms to infer cell-cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data. The method combines prior biological knowledge from a Ligand-Receptor-Pathway Knowledge Graph with dynamic adaptation to gene expression data, demonstrating superior precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches across multiple biological case studies. Specifically, scKGOT operates in three key steps: (1) it utilizes a knowledge graph (LRP-KG) containing known gene-gene interactions and pathway information, (2) it employs a novel algorithm incorporating gene importance metrics and pathway Knowledge Discrepancy to identify activated signaling pathways and confident ligand-receptor pairs, and (3) it reconstructs intercellular signaling networks by combining its predictions with established biological knowledge."

                "value": "The paper demonstrates strong originality through several key aspects. At its core, it presents a novel problem formulation that reframes cell-cell communication as an optimal transport problem integrated with knowledge graphs. This approach moves beyond simple binary predictions to introduce comprehensive pathway-level analysis, supported by an innovative scoring framework that combines gene importance with pathway knowledge discrepancy. It is impressive how the authors merge three distinct approaches, optimal transport theory, knowledge graph embeddings, and single-cell transcriptomics analysis while successfully integrating prior biological knowledge with data-driven insights. The paper brings new perspective to biological pathway analysis through its novel application of optimal transport, effectively bridging machine learning and systems biology while introducing a new framework for analyzing complex cellular interactions.\nThe quality of the work is particularly strong. The paper builds on a solid mathematical foundation, employs a comprehensive evaluation framework, and includes thorough ablation studies that demonstrate robust performance across multiple datasets. \nIn terms of clarity, the paper succeeds in presenting complex ideas in an accessible manner. The organization follows a logical flow of ideas, with a well-structured methodology section and clear presentation of results. The visualizations are particularly effective, employing comprehensive tools and clear performance comparisons.\nIts scientific impact is evident in how it advances our understanding of cell-cell communication, provides new tools for biological pathway analysis, and could potentially impact disease understanding and drug development. The methodological contribution is equally important, creating a new framework for analyzing complex biological systems while demonstrating successful integration of domain knowledge with machine learning. \nThe visualization of pathways using Sankey diagrams is particularly impressive, effectively illustrating the complex predicted interactions across pathways, ligands, and receptors. These diagrams not only help in understanding the flow of signals but also in identifying key interaction hubs and dominant pathways, making complex biological information more accessible and interpretable."

The current presentation leaves several critical implementation questions unanswered. Specifically, the paper should elaborate on the preprocessing pipeline for single-cell transcriptomics data, including how it handles common technical challenges like dropout effects, batch variations, and cell type annotation reliability.\nA crucial aspect that requires more clarity is the construction and quality control of the knowledge graph from multiple pathway databases. While the authors utilize both KEGG and Reactome databases (with over 2 million interaction records), the methodology for resolving redundancies and potentially conflicting information between these databases remains unclear. The integration strategy for different database formats, confidence scores, and annotation systems would be valuable information for readers looking to implement or build upon this approach and can be added as supplementary information.\nMinor Comments:\nWriting: There is redundant information in the introduction section (paragraphs 3 and 4 are repetitive)\nImplementation: Additional details about computational requirements and scalability would be valuable\nMethod availability: Information about code availability and documentation would benefit the community"

The authors may need to refer to some previous works such as Spatalk [1], EXPORT [2], VEGA[3] that utilize knowledge graphs to enhance model interpretability when analyzing omics data. \n\n2- Mathematical description of paper needs to be significantly improved: Some mathematical notations are not described at all when describing the proposed model. For example, what are s1 and s2 in equation (2)? or a and b in equation (3)?  also what's the intuition behind inequalities in (3)? Major revision is needed in mathematical description of the model to help readers better understand the model\n\n3- The results need to be better described: \n\n--For example whats the difference between left and right figures in Figure 1 (top row)? What does different colors mean? Also what does (CTDB) version of benchmarking tools mean in Figure 1 (bottom row) mean? Can authors provide more descriptive caption for figure 1?\n\n--In Figure 2C, why authors have focused on \"Eph-Ephrin Signaling\" or \"Signaling By Notch4\" pathways? Do they have any specific characteristics that authors have picked them for visualization? What does each subfigure indicate?\n\n-- In Figure 2D, can authors focus on one specific LRP pair that is previously well studied and describe the model results on that specific LRP pair? Its hard to see what result is novel from scKGOT in Figure 2D.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Shao, X., Li, C., Yang, H. et al.

                "value": "It is very difficult to understand the rationale and evaluation methods used in this paper. On the one hand, the authors make a good point that pathways in sender and receiver cells are related via causal links (i.e. the pathway in the sender cell creates a ligand that get secreted and physically interacts with a receptor on a receiver cell, which causes a pathway to activate within the receiver cell). On the other hand, the main problem I have is that there is no ground truth for this type of relationship presented, just a general comparison of learned networks and prior networks. Further much of the presented biology makes very little sense. For example, in figure 2d, there is a relationship where \"pathways in cancer\" generates a large number of ligands, which bind to a large number of receptors in another \"pathways in cancer\" pathway. This really makes not sense biologically and I cannot understand how it makes sense to predict it as relevant.\n\nAnother example \"By focusing on the largest connected components, we aimed to gain insights into how different cell types communicate within various biological contexts, contributing to a deeper under- standing of processes such as immune modulation, cell signaling, and tissue remodeling.\" - why is the largest connected component interesting here? The networks in Figure 3 almost look like a random assortment of pathways and don't provide any cell context information, which seriously undermines their use as a tool to interpret the results of scKGOT.\n\nMultiple statements in the paper demonstrate poor understanding of the biological application area e.g. \"2,223,641 and 1,651,421 records of ligand-receptor interaction facts respectively, including binding, dephosphorylation and activation, etc.\" - these are mostly not direct ligand-receptor relationships, but rather are relationships within pathways."
