    "title": "Hierarchical Protein Backbone Generation with Latent and Structure Diffusion",
    "abstract": "We propose a hierarchical protein backbone generative model that separates coarse and fine-grained details. Our approach called LSD consists of two stages: sampling latents which are decoded into a contact map then sampling atomic coordinates conditioned on the contact map. LSD allows new ways to control protein generation towards desirable properties while scaling to large datasets. In particular, the AlphaFold DataBase (AFDB) is appealing due as its diverse structure topologies but suffers from poor designability. We train LSD on AFDB and show latent diffusion guidance towards AlphaFold2 Predicted Alignment Error and long range contacts can explicitly balance designability, diversity, and noveltys in the generated samples. Our results are competitive with structure diffusion models and outperforms prior latent diffusion models.",

                "value": "This paper proposed a hierarchical framework for protein backbone design containing two stages. The first stage is built upon a latent diffusion model: a structure-to-contact autoencoder based on ProteinMPNN encoder and contact predicter was pretrained to encode the protein structure to $L \\times K$ representations. Then a modified Diffusion Transformer was trained in the latent space to generate synthetic representations. In the second stage, a modified version of FrameFlow was trained to design the atomic coordinates from the contact map. Additionally, two further guidance factors\u2014long-range contact and predicted alignment error\u2014were introduced to jointly enhance designability and diversity."

For instance, FoldingDiff uses internal coordinates, and FrameFlow\u2019s main architecture is SE(3)-equivariant. Intuitively, I don\u2019t see a significant advantage to applying diffusion models on contact maps.\n2) I'm unclear on certain aspects of the model design, such as why only node-wise features from ProteinMPNN are used for the latent representation, and why FrameFlow was chosen for recovering atomic coordinates, given that there are other models for structure prediction based on contact maps.\n3) It would be better to apply evaluation metrics to natural samples in order to reveal any biases in the evaluation pipeline. Additional analysis on how the models perform across proteins of varying sizes, classes, or folds would also be beneficial. Besides secondary structures, other biological analysis such as torsional angles, clashes and Ramachandran plots are needed.\n4) Some typos need correction, such as the citation of Chroma in Section 4."

                "value": "1) Why did you choose contact map rather than distance matrix while the latter is also SE(3)-invariant and more informative? There are also constraints on the contact map, such as neighboring residues in a sequence being in contact and certain patterns reflecting the corresponding secondary structure. Did you apply any methods to enforce these constraints?\n2) While FrameFlow was developed based on continuous normalizing flows (CNF) models, why didn't you also apply CNF for the first stage?\n3) Could you please explain what is the designable pairwise TM-score for and why it is the smaller the better here?"

The authors propose a new hierarchical method, called LSD, to generate protein backbones from coarse-grained to fine-grained. The first stage of LSD is to generate protein contact map (coarse-grained), and the second stage is to generate protein backbone conditioned on the contact map. An autoencoder (map between protein backbone, latent representation, and contact map) and two diffusion models are trained in this method. The model can generate diverse, designable, and novel protein backbones, and is comparable to current SOTA."

About the model design and corresponding ablation study: The current ablation study is more about hyperparameter search, missing support for the method design, for example, why do we need the contact map. One ablation is a pure latent diffusion model without contact map (similar to GeoLDM).\n2. About the task: this paper only focuses on backbone generation, can it be extended to all-atom generation? \n3. About baseline methods: AlphaFold3 also has a diffusion step. How to compare this method with AlphaFold3? \n4. About the training: This method includes several training stages and is not trained end-to-end, which may limit the final performance. Can it be trained end-to-end? If so, what are the results? \n5. In addition to the efficiency, what is the advantage over existing SDM (such as GENIE2)? We see that GENIE2 achieves good results. In addition, I am wondering why this method is more efficient than other methods. I think the diffusion step should be quite slow, and this method has two diffusion parts. In addition, from section 5.2, we know that k=4. And the input feature is 3*3=9. Therefore, the latent doesn\u2019t compress the input a lot.\n\nOther points:\n1. For LDM, how does DiT deal with different input sizes? Do we need any other design?\n2. Line 285: missing reference\n3. Add reference to the contact map definition used here (line 158)"

The paper proposes to sample the atomic coordinates. However, it is not clear how to guarantee that the sampled coordinates can form a possible structure on a higher level in practice. The constraint between the two levels is missing in the training process. Other important property such as SE3 is not discussed and addressed in the method.\n\n3. Important theoretical proof is missing. It looks like the paper intuitively leverages the reverse process of the diffusion model on the sequence. The original diffusion models such as DDPM or DDIM conduct the forward and the reverse process on the same level, which makes solving the Markov process tracable. However, it is not proven it still works when applied to two different representations.\n\n4. Quality of experiment. The paper only introduces **only one dataset** in the experiment.
