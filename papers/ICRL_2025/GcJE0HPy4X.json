    "title": "Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC): Sample Collection, Data Curation, and Beyond",
    "abstract": "Large-scale data collection is essential for developing personalized training data, mitigating the shortage of training data, and fine-tuning specialized models. However, creating high-quality datasets quickly and accurately remains a challenge due to annotation errors, the substantial time and costs associated with human labor. To address these issues, we propose Automatic Dataset Construction (ADC), an innovative methodology that automates dataset creation with negligible cost and high efficiency. Taking the image classification task as a starting point, ADC leverages LLMs for the detailed class design and code generation to collect relevant samples via search engines, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation and speeding up the data generation process. Despite these advantages, ADC also encounters real-world challenges such as label errors (label noise) and imbalanced data distributions (label bias). We provide open-source software that incorporates existing methods for label error detection, robust learning under noisy and biased data, ensuring a higher-quality training data and more robust model training procedure. Furthermore, we design three benchmark datasets focused on label noise detection, label noise learning, and class-imbalanced learning. These datasets are vital because there are few existing datasets specifically for label noise detection, despite its importance. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing popular methods on these datasets, thereby facilitating further research in the field.",

                "value": "The paper tackles the problem of automatic dataset creation. It proposes the ADC pipeline for the same which requires minimal human overhead. The proposal is to first decide the attributes (using a LLM) and then crawl data using attribute as filters (using Google and BING APIs). This is in contrast to existing approaches that label instances given a list of classes. Finally the instances are cleaned to filter noisy labeled samples. \n\nThe paper proposes Clothing-ADC dataset with 1M+ samples. Moreover, the paper also discusses the challenges associated with dataset construction including label errors, noisy labels and class imbalance. It then presents a solution (based on existing approaches for noise detection) to tackle these challenges to clean or improve reliability of the constructed dataset."

The paper tackles an important problem of dataset creation - the proposed approach (ADC) can do it in cost effective manner. Table 7 provides a comparison against existing label noise datasets including Cifar 10 N / H and Cifar to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADC.\n3. The paper presents the Clothing-ADC dataset with 1M+ samples with 12K classes. \n4. The paper also presents a subset of Clothing-ADC CLT which is suitable for class imbalance learning. Various baselines (Drops, Bal-softmax, Logit-Adjust) are also reported for this dataset. A subset of 20K samples is also proposed for label noise detection.\n5. It is important to discuss the biases (tail or infrequent classes) and noise (wrongly labeled samples) introduced due to the web data - the paper does so clearly.\n6. The code and hyper-parameter details are clearly specified."

It may not apply to the cases where data is available in some form such as unlabelled corpus."

How will it translate - some components (cleaning) are straightforward, others not so much (web scraping or labeling)? Please clarify if it doesn't apply. \n2. It will be helpful to have a more elaborate discussion on synthetic datasets. The paper already includes benefits of ADC over TDC. ADC should be clearly contrasted against synthetic data. Can some of the issues introduced by hallucination be recitified in cleaning stage?\n3. Please include statistics for class distribution - this will provide a better idea of imbalance as well.\n4. The following sentence is a bit unclear \"For applications where some label noise can be tolerated, existing data curation software capable of identifying and filtering out irrelevant images, such as Docta, CleanLab , and Snorkel 1, etc.\""

The paper presents many algorithms to identify label noise but is lacking detailed analysis of the impact of each algorithm on the resulting dataset and downstream model performance\n3. Related to the point above, the paper does not provide quality metrics to evaluate the quality of the dataset after before/after using the ADC pipeline to clean the data, this makes it hard to assess the effectiveness of the automated curation process and ADC\u2019s ability to produce high quality data"
