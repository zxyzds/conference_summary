    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches are widely used for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with instructional preferences. However, traditional RLHF methods often rely on binary labels, which fail to capture the pairwise differences in human perception, leading to potential performance degradation.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce $\\textbf{Gap-Aware Preference Optimization}$ (GaPO), a novel approach that integrates the degree of semantic gaps into preference optimization. By modifying the margin term in the loss function and replacing it with an estimated gap computed using general metrics, GaPO provides a new supervisory signal that explicitly highlights the nuances between preference pairs. This new signal helps the model allocate gradients more rationally during optimization, facilitating more effective learning from the preference data.\nExperiments conducted with a strong base model, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, demonstrate that GaPO surpasses state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks. Our best-performing model, GaPO-ROUGE\\_L, achieves a win rate of 52.8\\% on AlpacaEval 2.0, exceeding the baseline methods by 5.3 points.",

Specifically, the LC of SFT is 26.0% and GaPO without norm is 28.8%. When GaPO is combined with the scale norm, a hyperparameter \u03b3 is introduced, which is considered the contribution from SimPO, making it difficult to evaluate the independent validity of EF. The authors are advised to conduct more experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of EF, such as comparing GaPO with and without EF.\n2. Missing gradient analysis for the EF term. The authors do not provide an analysis of the role of the EF term when applying gradient updates, for example, how the likelihood of preferred samples increases and that of dispreferred samples decreases. Including such an analysis would strengthen the paper, similar to the approach taken in Section 4 in DPO.\n3. The concept of the \"semantic gap\" is not sufficiently clarified in the abstract. The readers may struggle to understand its meaning. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a clear definition or an illustrative example to aid comprehension.\n4. Missing Reference for KTO. In Section 4.1, the authors do not provide an appropriate reference for KTO."

                "value": "My major concern is that the motivation is to identify perception margin, which doesn't quite match the actual implementation of Estimated Margin. The three machine translation (L247) metrics, Jaccard score, ROUGE, and BERT score, are all defiend to operate at token/multi-token level, without actually capturing the overal semantic meaning. \n\nThe empirical study shows that GaPO outperforms baselines on AlpacaEval 2.0 but not for Arena-Hard or MT-Bench. Since AlpacaEval 2.0 has a specific emphasis on the length of responses, I would speculate that all the token-level EF metrics are effective only on a narrower range of scenarios. Specifically, only when the plausible responses are largely similar at token-level can the proposed metrics be seen as proxy semantic measures. For challenging queries that expect complex responses with certain reasoning capability, token-level comparison doesn't fully capture human pairwise preference anymore.\n\nThe data-dependent margin and beyond-binary motivation is a good direction for preference optimization, however what the paper present doesn't fully exploit the potential. For example, there can be a whole much wider spectrum of margins that more faithfully match the motivation:\n- Simpler variants include the length difference between $y_w$ and $y_l$;\n- Semantic-level variants may consider something like response-level LM embedding distance between $y_w$ and $y_l$. \n\nA more comprehensive study over these options may bring in further contribution in this direction, and also potentially address the non-improvement for Arena-Hard and MT-Bench."

Although the win rate of GaPO on AlpacaEval 2.0 is better, the response of GaPO is lengthy. Consider that LLM judges often favor longer responses (even with LC), I do not believe the results can prove its superiority against SimPO based solely on AlpacaEval 2.0. Similarly, in Fig. 1 (right) and Tab. 2, although GaPO achieves a higher LC win rate in some cases, the overall response length is longer than that of SimPO.\n\n- The author(s) claim that the uniform treatment of preference pairs (regardless of the differences between responses) expands the search space during training, potentially resulting in a decrease in log probabilities. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (right), GaPO-rougeL achieves the best performance among different methods, while also causing a decrease in log probability, which contrasts with the idea of limiting the search space by accounting for the senmatic gaps between preference pairs. Insead, the results show that across different EF metrics, the win rate decreases with higher log probability."
