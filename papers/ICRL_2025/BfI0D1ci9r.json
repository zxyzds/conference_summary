    "title": "Physics-informed GNN for non-linear constrained optimization: PINCO, a solver for the AC-optimal power flow",
    "abstract": "The energy transition is driving the integration of large shares of intermittent power sources in the electric power grid. Therefore, addressing the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential.\nThe AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must be solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of power systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its linearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the interior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem. However, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not guarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural network, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides accurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the established non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes effectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We show that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality constraints. Furthermore, it can function both as a solver and as a hybrid universal function approximator. Moreover, the approach can be easily adapted to different power systems with minimal adjustments to the hyperparameters, including systems with multiple generators at each bus. Overall, this work demonstrates an advancement in the field of power system optimization to tackle the challenges of the energy transition.

There are several works already using PINNs, in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. There exists a substantial body of work under end-to-end learning that relates to this area, for example: [1]-[2].\n\n\u2014 The issue mentioned above seems to stem from an incomplete literature review. For example, [1] presents a survey on end-to-end learning methods for constrained optimization, the general class of optimization problems to which ACOPF belongs. Many works listed there use PINNs in either supervised or unsupervised fashions. Additionally, several key references such as [2]-[4] are not discussed in the paper. Furthermore, the use of GNNs for the ACOPF problem is also not a unique contribution, as noted by the authors themselves. Authors should clearly discuss the limitations of these works and highlight how their work differs from them and provide advantages. \n\n\u2014 Experimental studies: The results presented are limited in terms of the number of experiments and comparative analysis. No comparisons are made to existing ML methods.   Authors must compare the results with various ML methods. For example, the cost difference with the proposed method is significantly higher than that achieved by various ML methods for ACOPF.\n\n\n\n[1] Kotary, James, Ferdinando Fioretto, Pascal van Hentenryck, and Bryan Wilder. \"End-to-End Constrained Optimization Learning: A Survey.\" In 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI 2021, pp. 4475-4482.

For e.g., did the authors explore architectural modifications to the GNN tailored to the characteristics of power transmission networks, or a customized optimization technique designed for AC-OPF? This could significantly enhance the paper\u2019s originality within the ML domain.\n\n- *Scope*: The current approach also presents practical concerns in real-world applications. In practice, power system operators frequently adjust network topology due to maintenance, unplanned outages, and other operational needs, leading to variations in the grid adjacency matrix for a *given* power system test case. Based on the paper\u2019s description, the proposed model would need re-training from scratch for each such new grid adjacency matrix, which presents a notable limitation. Did the authors explore methods to make their model more adaptable to changing topologies for a given test case (even if the cost of the OPF solution is relatively high)? Developing a more flexible framework that can accommodate such variations within a single model would make the approach far more practical than showcasing the performance results across multiple IEEE benchmark systems."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Could the authors elaborate on the ML-specific challenges encountered when modeling more than one generator per electrical bus? Is there a fundamental challenge that has prevented past approaches from addressing such cases, or is this simply a modeling choice that the authors address by introducing artificial nodes?\n\n- When solving the IEEE 118-bus problem, any node can be designated as the reference node by including the reference bus angle as an equality constraint in the OPF optimization problem. Could the authors clarify why phase angle comparisons are not included in their evaluation?\n\n- The comparisons in Figure 3 could benefit from additional context. While the differences between the MIPS solver and the proposed solution are shown, it\u2019s not immediately clear how these absolute differences inform the effectiveness of the model, given that the OPF objective is primarily centered on minimizing generator operating costs. Could the authors clarify the purpose of Figure 3 and what specific insights they intended to convey through these comparisons?\n\n- To enhance interpretability, it might be useful to include visualizations that track the evolution of equality loss and relative cost differences throughout training. This could provide more relevant insights into how well the model aligns with the OPF objective over time.\n\n- As noted in the weaknesses, the current formulation focuses on a *single* fixed network topology for each power system case. However, in real-world applications, system operators often encounter dynamic topologies due to changes in operational conditions. Formulating the OPF learning problem to accommodate time-varying grid topologies is more relevant and such a formulation would also give rise to ML modeling challenges that could inspire innovative techniques tailored to real-world needs, potentially making a stronger contribution to both the ML and power systems communities."

(5) is incorrect, specifically the term $\\mu_{k} g_{j}(w_{u}^{k})^2$.\n  Assuming inequality constraints are of the form $g(w) \\leq 0$, this quadratic term effectively drives all inequality constraints towards being binding (i.e. $g(w) = 0$), which is not theoretically sound.\n\n* The paper argues that the use of a graph neural network supports changes in the grid topology, but does not present experiments that corroborate this claim\n\n* The paper claims that the proposed model can achieve \"zero violation of inequality constraints.\" This is not a substantial achievement, given that said inequality constraints are either simple variable bounds (which can be enforced via a bounded activation function) or simple l2 norm constraint (which can also be enforced by a simple scheme). The complexity of AC-OPF is in satisfying _both_ equality and inequality constraints. It is straightforward to enforced either set of constraints separately (i.e. only equality or only inequality constraints).\n\n* Numerical experiments consider AC-OPF instances on systems with up to 118 buses. This is 100x smaller than real-life instances, which comprise (at least) in the order of 10,000 buses. \n\n  It should be noted that several works have trained ML models to predict AC-OPF with systems of that scale:\n  * _Spatial Network Decomposition for Fast and Scalable AC-OPF Learning_ (https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3124726)\n  * _Compact optimization learning for AC Optimal Power Flow_ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08840): up to 30,000 buses\n  * _CANOS: A Fast and Scalable Neural AC-OPF Solver Robust To N-1 Perturbations_ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17660): up to 10,000 buses, and also uses graph neural network architectures\n\n* Training times appear to be very large (10 to 24 hours as reported in Section 5). Given that the paper only considers very small artificial systems, it is not clear that the proposed scheme would scale to real-life systems. A reasonable target would be at most 6-8hrs of training time on a systems with about 10,000 buses.\n\n* Numerical experiments do not compare against any existing ML methodology for AC-OPF problems.\n\nIssues about the paper:\n* Not all notations are properly defined. For instance, the formalism of equality and inequality constraints is not defined before the Augmented Lagrangian presented in Eq. (5). Similarly, this equation uses a parameter $w^{k}_{u}$ that is not defined.\n* the paper does not present the data distribution used to train the model. It should be noted that generating data by perturbing individual loads independently is not realistic, as it leads to a very narrow variability in total demand.\n\n  Note that there are open-source datasets and data generators for AC-OPF problems, e.g.:\n  * OPFData (https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07234v1) is an open-source dataset of AC-OPF instances and their solutions\n  * OPFGenerator (https://github.com/AI4OPT/OPFGenerator) is an open-source instance generator for various OPF formulations\n\n* In addition to the comments, above, the paper sometimes makes misleading claims. For instance, at lines 88-89, it is stated that \"INCO allows for solving the AC-OPF **without violations**.\" This claim is not substantiated by the results reported in Section 4 (Tables 1 and 2)."
