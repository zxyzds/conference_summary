    "abstract": "Conformal prediction provides machine learning models with prediction sets that offer theoretical guarantees, but the underlying assumption of exchangeability limits its applicability to time series data. Furthermore, existing approaches struggle to handle multi-step ahead prediction tasks, where uncertainty estimates across multiple future time points are crucial.  We propose JANET (Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series), a novel framework for constructing conformal prediction regions that are valid for both univariate and multivariate time series. JANET generalises the inductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions with controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to specific application needs.  Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's superior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series datasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification in sequential data.",

                "value": "The paper presents a promising framework, JANET, for joint prediction regions in time-series analysis, but it falls short in critical areas that limit its contribution to the field. The theoretical results are somewhat incremental and do not substantively advance beyond current methodologies, reducing the novelty of the work. Additionally, the lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches in multi-dimensional conformal time-series analysis weakens the empirical evaluation, particularly as one-step-ahead prediction\u2014a crucial baseline\u2014has been omitted. Finally, the literature review is incomplete, missing key recent works that provide valuable context and benchmarks for conformal prediction in time-series settings. These limitations suggest that the paper does not yet reach the level of rigor and comprehensiveness required for acceptance."

JANET offers guarantees by leveraging an inductive conformal prediction (ICP) approach, which only requires a single model fit. Key contributions include adapting non-conformity scores for multi-dimensional residuals, controlling K-familywise error rates (allowing specified error tolerance in predictions), and incorporating historical context to improve prediction accuracy.\n\nThe novelty lies in the generalization of CP to multi-dimensional time-series data with controlled K-familywise error rates. JANET extends prior work on CP by allowing joint prediction regions across multiple time steps and accounting for temporal dependencies through adaptive non-conformity scores. This advancement addresses the limitations of standard CP for multi-step predictions and offers approximate validity under certain ergodicity assumptions, making it applicable to single and independent time-series data. The experimental evaluation covers both single and multiple time-series settings, with JANET demonstrating competitive performance against several baseline methods and there are simulations on synthetic and real datasets (e.g., GDP data and COVID-19 case counts)."

I believe the method should at least be compared with respect to one-step ahead prediction, since it is a special case of multi-step prediction. There is no fundamental difference in constructing multi-step ahead prediction from single step ahead, if you treat the prediction for y_{t+s}, s > 1, as the response variable instead of y_{t+1}. \n\n-There are many conformal prediction for time series paper as of now in the literature, and I feel the literature survey is incomplete and missing several key references, such as \n\nAngelopoulos, Anastasios, Emmanuel Candes, and Ryan J.

A more thorough discussion differentiating this work from [1] would strengthen the paper\u2019s contribution.\n- Although the authors emphasize the applicability of their method to multivariate time series, all experiments appear to be conducted solely on univariate data.\n- More detailed discussion is needed on whether the method provides significant performance gains compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, while the results suggest slight under-coverage in many cases, it is unclear if the width reduction compensates adequately for this under-coverage.\n- The authors place significant emphasis on computational efficiency; however, this advantage seems to stem from the use of split conformal rather than the proposed algorithm itself. Moreover, despite this emphasis, the analysis of computational complexity is limited to a brief mention in Section 6.1.2.\n\nTypos:\n- Line 222: $l \\to L_{cal}$\n\n[3] Barber, Rina Foygel, et al. \"Conformal prediction beyond exchangeability.\" *The Annals of Statistics* 51.2 (2023): 816-845."

What does $\\mathcal{A}$ it output, if it only takes two datasets as input and does not take in the test sample? Overall 4.3 was not clear to me. Isn't eq 3 and 4 the same equation with an reused $\\epsilon$? Theorem 1 can benefit from some explanation as well (i.e. what does the error depend on, how it behaves with different data properties etc.)\n\n- the notations are a bit messy throughout the paper. For example, what is the arrow x in line 299? (this sequence notation is not used anywhere else, you use bold $\\mathbb{X}$ instead). in Eq 5 and 6 the $\\hat{\\sigma}_i$ can be either a function or a scalar.  In line 306, is $X$ the input at this time step or relevant history?  Cleaning up these notations will make the paper easier to follow.\n\n- Line 315: What does \"inverting the conformity scores\" mean?\n\n##  Writing / Presentation\n \n- deviation-scaled conformal intervals are only \"adaptive\" in a very narrow sense (of X*'s deviation from other training data) and doesn't always present better efficiency. In times series CP literature, adaptivity usually means adaptive to changes in nonconformity score distribution (along the lines of ACI or CAHFT). \n\n- From my understanding, the paper's methodology contains two parts: permutation for calibration, and scaling. Both of them are existing CP algorithms adapted by the authors to the time series setting, but it is unclear what are the authors' modifications. Can you add a few sentences to each of the two sections on what are your original contributions? \n\n- A similar concern as above, I fear that the setting of the method is not well explained. The author repeatedly emphasized that the algorithm's guarantees hold \"under mild assumptions\", but in reality the data has to be strongly mixing and have ergodicity. I would recommend the authors to further explain in the paper the assumptions being made, and have examples of the kind of data the algorithm is suitable for.\n\n\n## to summarize\n\nI believe the paper addresses an well-motivated problem and presents a sound method, but needs significant restructuring and clarification to be at the standard of a conference like ICLR. If these concerns are addressed, I'm happy to increase my score."

Is this correct? If not, could the authors provide detailed proofs to clarify this?\n\n**Question 2**: How do the horizon size H and the  error tolerance K effects the K-FWER control for single time series.

I think this is because the current experiments only report the \"frequency of coverage\" on the test set, which is not an unbiased estimator of K-FWER. I would like to see experiments verifying the finite sample K-FWER control of JANET for multiple independent time series by sufficient replications.\n\n**Question 4**: The references are not properly cited.
