    "title": "TabWak: A Watermark for Tabular Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Synthetic data offers alternatives for data augmentation and sharing. Till date, it remains unknown how to use watermarking techniques to trace and audit synthetic tables generated by tabular diffusion models to mitigate potential misuses. In this paper, we design TabWak, the first watermarking method to embed invisible signatures that control the sampling of Gaussian latent codes used to synthesize table rows via the diffusion backbone. TabWak has two key features. Different from existing image watermarking techniques, TabWak uses self-cloning and shuffling to embed the secret key in positional information of random seeds that control the Gaussian latents, allowing to use different seeds at each row for high inter-row diversity and enabling row-wise detectability. To further boost the robustness of watermark detection against post-editing attacks, TabWak uses a valid-bit mechanism that focuses on the tail of the latent code distribution for superior noise resilience. We provide theoretical guarantees on the row diversity and effectiveness of detectability. We evaluate TabWak on five datasets against baselines to show that the quality of watermarked tables remains nearly indistinguishable from non-watermarked tables while achieving high detectability in the presence of strong post-editing attacks, with a 100% true positive rate at a 0.1% false positive rate on synthetic tables with fewer than 300 rows. Our code is available at the following anonymized repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TabWak-4E65/.",

Again, since I'm not an expert on tabular data generation, and this method relies on the dimensionality of latent space. What is the key capacity for this method? More specifically, what does m equal in your experiments? I assume this is a data and model-dependent hyperparameter that is fixed in your experiment since no retraining is needed, and it heavily affects the practicability of your method since it will affect the upper bound of your key capacity. A brief explanatory note on this could be beneficial."

Expanding on these aspects would enhance the distinctiveness of the contribution.\n\n* In designing the \"valid bit mechanism,\" the authors focus on extrema values at the ends of the distribution, which is logical but may underutilize the central parts of the distribution. To validate this choice, theoretical proof or empirical evidence is needed to show that this approach outperforms one that also uses centered values for repeated information, as repetition might improve robustness.\n\n* The experimental results are not fully satisfactory. For instance, in Table 2, **the robustness of the proposed method falls short of [1] across four out of five datasets.** The explanations for this gap are limited and may not fully justify the proposed method's advantages. Additional experimental data should be provided to demonstrate the method\u2019s superiority, or the authors should offer a more comprehensive analysis of the results, clarifying how the proposed method remains advantageous despite the observed performance gap.\n   \n[1].
