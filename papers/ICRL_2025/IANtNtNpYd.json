    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive black-box functions while retaining sample ef\ufb01ciency. However, scaling BO to high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes performing standard BO in several local trust regions (TuRBO) for heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration. Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling ef\ufb01ciency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling ef\ufb01ciency while preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct several local quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results that our method enhances the ef\ufb01cacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world applications.",

TuRBO uses local GP within each trust region to deal with large number of observations, whereas TuRBO-D does local quadratic approximation to a glocal GP instead of local GPs\n2. TuRBO choose samples across trust regions through Thompson sampling, whereas TuRBO-D traverse through all trust regions recursively, each time choosing a sample from a trust region.\n\nThere are many real world applications in the TuRBO paper (Eriksson et al., 2019).

                "value": "1. From my understanding and as the authors also describe in their paper, a main strength and motivation of TuRBO is to allow for the heterogeneous modeling of the objective function which is especially important in high dimension. This is done by local GP fits. On the other hand, the authors' approach globally fits the GP which seems to basically forgo this important strength of TuRBO. In other words, if the global GP fit is bad, then the extracted derivatives are also badly informed, and thus the method would work poorly in high dimension. The authors claim that their approach gains sampling efficiency, but how important is this compared to the heterogeneity in modeling the objective? It seems that heterogeneity is more important, as the GP fit typically depends negligibly on points that are far away but a poor modeling of the objective function is more impactful (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n3. The main theoretical result (Theorem 4) is weak in the following sense: It says, with high probability, the inf of gradient over the solution sequence is close to 0. However, this inf only means that there exists a subsequence whose gradients are close to 0. If we stop the algorithm at some large iteration step, there is no guarantee that the gradient is small since that step may not be in that subsequence. That is, even putting aside the lack of convergence rate etc. (which I understand can be difficult to obtain in general for BO algorithms) and viewing at a basic level, the theoretical result does not seem meaningful. \n\nThe above are my main concerns. Additionally,\n\n1. The authors propose to use a subset of dimensions instead of full dimension to form the quadratic approximation, but the theoretical analyses do not take this into account.\n\n2. A possible strength of TuRBO is that the local fit uses less computation due to the smaller matrix inversion. However, by global fitting, the authors' approach faces a computation load as high as standard BO (as least for this posterior update step). This might need some discussions.\n\n3. The implementation of the main benchmark TuRBO has no details, and it's unclear if the comparison is fair. E.g., how do you set the hyperparameters for TuRBO and TuRBO-D?"

If it's your discovery, then please clarify. Moreover, it would be good to clarify whether the approach of using a subset of dimensions is known in addressing this issue or is your invention.\n\nLine 400: The epsilon is not used in the conclusion of the theorem."

I believe that these assumptions are not valid under the assumption $f \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(0, k)$ (suggested in Assumption 1), even if we adopt commonly-used SE or Mat\u00e9rn family kernels. Some assumptions seem to be valid for these commonly-used kernels by relying on more careful probabilistic arguments; however, others are unknown to me. I summarize my current understanding below:\n    - Assumption 3: When the kernel is SE or Mat\u00e9rn, the boundedness of the sample path is valid with high probability if the input domain is compact (e.g., Ghosal & Roy (2006), Kandasamy et al. (2019)); however, the same result does not hold for $\\mathbb{R}^D$ (as the authors assumed).\n    - Assumption 1: When the kernel is four times continuously differentiable and stationary, the Lipschitz assumption holds with high probability for the compact input domain (e.g., Srinivas et al. (2009)).\n    - Assumptions 2 and 4: When the kernel is four times continuously differentiable and stationary, the gradient norm is bounded from above with high probability in a compact input domain (e.g., Srinivas et al. (2009)); however, I do not know of any existing results that suggest the true and approximate Hessian matrices are bounded from above.\n\nGhosal, Subhashis, and Anindya Roy. \"Posterior consistency of Gaussian process prior for nonparametric binary regression.\" (2006): 2413-2429.  \nSrinivas, Niranjan, et al. \"Gaussian process optimization in the bandit setting: No regret and experimental design.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:0912.3995 (2009).  \nKandasamy, Kirthevasan, et al. \"Multi-fidelity Gaussian process bandit optimization.\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 66 (2019): 151-196.\n\n- There seem to be some gaps between the theoretically and practically verified algorithms without discussion. Discussions about the following gaps are desired:\n    - The explanations in Section 3 and the empirical evaluations in Section 6 seem to allow noisy function evaluations; however, the theory and algorithm construction rely on noise-less function evaluation (e.g., Line 8 in Algorithm 1, construction of $m_k$ in Eq.(2)).\n    - The treatment of the trust regions is different between practical (Lines 190, 191) and theoretical (Algorithm 2) usages.\n    - The random subset-selection of the dimensions (Lines 213-226) seems not to be considered in the theorems.\n- The description of the experimental section is inadequate to reproduce the results for the reader. For example, clarification of the following settings is desired:\n    - The choice of the kernel.\n    - The treatment of the hyperparameters of the kernel.\n    - The parameter settings of the local optimization routine.\n\n(Minor)\n- Last year's NeurIPS paper (Wu et al. (2023)) is closely related to this paper in the sense that the convergence of the local Bayesian optimization routine is analyzed.\n\nWu, Kaiwen, et al. \"The behavior and convergence of local Bayesian optimization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2023)."
