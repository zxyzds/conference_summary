    "abstract": "The Optimal Transport (OT) problem investigates a transport map that connects two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. Finding such a transport map has diverse applications in machine learning, such as generative modeling and image-to-image translation. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and simulation-free approach for solving the Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport (EUOT) problem. We derive the dynamical form of this EUOT problem, which is a generalization of the Schr\u00f6dinger bridges (SB) problem. Based on this, we derive dual formulation and optimality conditions of the EUOT problem from the stochastic optimal control interpretation. By leveraging these properties, we propose a simulation-free algorithm to solve EUOT, called Simulation-free EUOT (SF-EUOT). While existing SB models require expensive simulation costs during training and evaluation, our model achieves simulation-free training and one-step generation by utilizing the reciprocal property. Our model demonstrates significantly improved scalability in generative modeling and image-to-image translation tasks compared to previous SB methods.",

Furthermore, based on these new connections, the authors derive the dual formulation of the EUOT problem and its optimality conditions. In turn, this novel dual formulation allowed authors to propose a novel maximin simulation-free solver for the EUOT problem. The authors evaluate the proposed solver on 2D toy experiments, experiments with Gaussians, image generation (CIFAR-10), and unpaired image translation (Celeba Male to Female and Wild to Cat datasets)."

                "value": "1) In lines 308-309, the authors propose considering the dual formulation of Eq. 23 given by Eq. 25. However, Eq. 23 depends only on $V_1$, i.e., only the values of $V$ in the terminal time $t=1$, while Eq. 25 depends on the all-time moments of $V_t$. Hence, the optimization result given by Eq. 25 should depend only on the values of $V$ at the terminal times, which seems strange. Could you comment on this?\n\n2) Does Eq. 25 require $V$ to be optimal, i.e., satisfy the HJB equation, or can it be used for any time-dependent function $V$? It is interesting because you propose to use the regularizer for the HJB condition in Eq. 26. In practice, at the arbitrary step of the algorithm, the HJB condition will unlikely hold so that it would influence the optimization of $\\rho$.\n\n3) In the algorithm (lines 229-230), you propose simultaneously performing optimization updates for both generator $T_{\\theta}$ and value network $V$. However, the motivation for this choice is not clear to me. In Section 4.1, you say that you need to solve an additional optimization problem (Eq. 25) for $\\rho$, which makes me think that this problem (Eq. 25) should be solved before updating the value function $V$."

Additionally, an explanation for the high FID in Table 2 compared to DSBM\u2019s performance would clarify any discrepancies in resolution or model effectiveness.\n3.

For instance, in Section 4.1, a lot of equations are presented, which are obtained by performing only some rewriting (e.g. equation (21) to (22) and then (22) to (24)). While this is very clear, I would suggest to just report the last equation (24) with some description of what has been done, and report the detailed derivations in Appendix. Also, the legend of Figure 3 are too small. A lot of abreviations are not given or are given after their introduction (NFE, IPF, IMF, HJB...). The notations often change between $u_t(x)$ and $u(t,x)$.\n\nThe full procedure is not very clear. It would be better to add an Algorithm.\n\nI believe some relevant baselines are missing from the Generative modeling experiment. I am thinking e.g. of [1] who solve the UOT problem and reported a FID of 2.97 on CIFAR10.\n\nWhile this method computes an unbalanced OT problem, the robustness to outliers is not discussed nor tested.\n\n[1] Choi, Jaemoo, Jaewoong Choi, and Myungjoo Kang. \"Generative modeling through the semi-dual formulation of unbalanced optimal transport.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024)."

I would be more accurate to describe it as a (conditional) probability or probability kernel.\n\nSince the first marginal of the problem is fixed, it would be clearer to state the problem as semi-unbalanced. Is it more difficult to derive Theorem 3.2 and Proposition 3.4 with both marginals relaxed?\n\nThe method relaxes a lot of constraints into the loss. I wonder how hard it is to make sure every term go to 0. Also, is this method costly compared e.g. to the semi-dual approach of [1]? And is it stable to train?\n\nLine 512, it is stated that \"there is no closed-form for the EUOT problem\". But I believe there are in [2], and [2] is also the right reference for closed forms of the EOT problem between Gaussian. Therefore, I would suggest to also perform the experiments in Section 5.2 with unbalanced Gaussian.\n\nSome references on generative modeling with unbalanced OT problem could be added, e.g. [3, 4].\n\nTypos:\n- Line 175: \"Dynamcial\"\n- Line 513: \"Conducted same benchmark\"\n\n[1] Choi, Jaemoo, Jaewoong Choi, and Myungjoo Kang. \"Generative modeling through the semi-dual formulation of unbalanced optimal transport.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).\n\n[2] Janati, H., Muzellec, B., Peyr\u00e9, G., & Cuturi, M.

Authors train them on functionals, derived from the original SOC formulation and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Representation of the problem in terms of this coordinate descent results in the ability to parameterize distribution dynamics of EUOT as a stochastic one-step map instead of the stochastic process, thus allowing to achieve simulation-free (SF) procedure, which authors call SF-EUOT.

                "value": "My main concerns are related to the applicability of the method and limited comparison with the other existing models.\n\n* First, in Table 1 the authors compare their method with models based on EOT, Diffusion and Flow Matching. While I agree with the choice of the EOT solvers, most of the chosen diffusion models correspond to results from 2021-2022. They are now outperformed by a large margin by even one-step diffusion distillation methods (CTM [1] and GDD [2] with FID around 1.6-1.7), which should be indicated for a more fair comparison. Overall, while being more efficient than other EOT solvers, the proposed SF-EUOT is still inefficient compared to more practical methods for unconditional generation. Given this, I would consider this experiment more as a benchmark for EOT solvers rather than a broad comparison with competitive methods.\n\n* In Image-to-Image experiments and in Table 2, in particular, authors choose a limited set of methods for comparison. Two of them, DiscoGAN and CycleGAN, perform much worse than newer (but still 2-4 years old) one-step GAN-based methods such as CUT [3], StarGAN-v2 [4], and ITTR [5], which complicates fair comparison. In the Wild->Cat experiment authors choose to compare only with multi-step methods based on Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, while the results from DiscoGAN, CycleGAN and NOT, present in the Male->Female experiment, are missing. Besides, there are other SB-based methods proven competitive in practice, e.g. NSB [6], which is, being a few-step method, relevant for comparison. Overall, this section would greatly benefit from more consistent comparisons (e.g. with the same set of models for both experiments) and from adding higher-quality one-step (or few-step) baselines.\n\n* In the Image-to-Image experiments, only FID is measured as a metric of generation quality. However, as it was done by the authors in Figure 2, it is essential to also measure some similarity metric between the input and the output. It will allow comparison of faithfulness-realism tradeoff between the proposed method and the baselines and will exclude situations e.g. in which the method achieves better FID at the cost of poor transport cost.\n\n* Samples obtained by the SF-EUOT in the Wild->Cat translation problem (Figure 8), seem to significantly suffer from mode collapse.\n\n[1] Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion\n\n[2] Diffusion Models Are Innate One-Step Generators\n\n[3] Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation\n\n[4] StarGAN v2: Diverse Image Synthesis for Multiple Domains\n\n[5] ITTR: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Transformers\n\n[6] Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via Neural Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge"

While it is mentioned that the Laplace operator is approximated by the Hutchinson trace estimator, here it would require calculating a Hessian-vector product, which is much more computationally expensive than the Jacobian-vector product, used in likelihood calculations.\n\n* Did the authors test the method in the ODE scenario (with sigma = 0.0)? While it may be less interesting due to the higher feasibility of the non-entropic OT problem (e.g. solved by NOT), it should substantially decrease training time due to the lack of the Laplace operator in computations.\n\n* Could the authors check whether there is a bug in the line 366? Here, the partial derivative with respect to time is approximated by the discrete-time approximation of the full time-derivative, which seems confusing.\n\n* Despite training a stochastic map, in Figure 3 only one-to-one mappings are visualized.
