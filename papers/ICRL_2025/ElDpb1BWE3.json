    "abstract": "Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical fields, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies often rely on numerical solvers or machine learning-based surrogate models to solve or accelerate these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers\u2014each responsible for evolving a specific physical field\u2014into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges.  Furthermore, no universal algorithm exists for multi-component simulations, which adds to the complexity.\nHere we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component Simulation with Diffusion models (MulSimDiff) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, MulSimDiff learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical field/component conditioned on other fields/components. In inference, MulSimDiff generates coupled multiphysics solutions and multi-component structures by sampling from the joint probability distribution, achieved by composing the learned energy functions in a structured way. We test our method in three tasks. In the reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling problems, MulSimDiff successfully predicts the coupling solution using decoupled data, while the surrogate model fails in the more complex second problem. For the thermal and mechanical analysis of the prismatic fuel element, MulSimDiff trained for single component prediction accurately predicts a larger structure with 64 components, reducing the relative error by 40.3% compared to the surrogate model.",

The authors should better precise why the new datasets they propose is a contribution to the literature. \n- claim (3): More importantly, based on the results, it is difficult to determine whether the proposed method is advantageous for other multiphysics, multi-component systems, given the fact that it may not be competitive in terms of computational cost (see below question)\n\nMinor remarks. \n- l102. \"a process we have mathematically proven\", I don't think a \"process\" qualifies as being able to be \"mathematically proven\". You should precise what is \"mathematically proven\"\n- l107. \"This reverse diffusion process is also mathematically validated\", same remark\n- l137. \"there do not exist utilized machine learning methods for multi-component simulation\". I don't really understand the novelty since, technically, UNets [Ronneberger et al. 2015], FNO [Li et al. 2022], Transformer [Mccabe et al. 2023], diffusion [Kohl et al. 2024] models are already used on multi-component simulations.\n- l251. Paragraph 3.2 is confusing. In particular, there can be confusion between \"multiple fields\", \"multiphysics\" and \"multi-components\". After having read the paper carefully, it seems to me that the main difference between \"multiphysics\" and \"multi-components\" is in the way they are treated computationally. The multiple components being treated as interchangeable, in the sense that the same model is used for the conditioning of one on the others, while multiple \"physics\" do not assume such interchangeability. \n- l253.

Do you have a rough estimation of how it compares in terms of execution time and in terms of FLOPs? \n- In algorithms 1 and 2, could you clarify what the \"outer inputs\" are in comparison to the \"physical fields\"?"
