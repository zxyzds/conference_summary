    "title": "SegFit: Robust SMPL-X Fitting with Body Part Segmentation on Real-World Point Clouds",
    "abstract": "Fitting parametric human body models to 3D point cloud is crucial for applications such as virtual reality and human-robot interaction but remains challenging due to the lack of contextual guidance, often leading to imprecise results. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that incorporates body part segmentation into the fitting process, enhancing pose estimation and segmentation accuracy. \nOur method starts with an initial segmentation, assigning each point to a specific body part. This segmentation guides a two-step optimization in fitting an SMPL-X model: first, approximating the initial pose and orientation using body part centroids, and second, refining the model by considering the entire point cloud. After fitting, we reassign body parts to the point cloud through nearest-neighbor matching, resulting in more accurate segmentation. This enhanced segmentation serves as pseudo ground truth to fine-tune the segmentation network in a self-supervised manner, creating a feedback loop where improvements in pose fitting lead to better segmentation and vice versa. We evaluate our approach on four challenging datasets -- PosePrior, EgoBody, BEHAVE, and Hi4D -- demonstrating significant improvements over leading methods, including a tenfold increase in pose modeling accuracy and a 15\\% enhancement in segmentation accuracy after fine-tuning. Our contributions are twofold: (1) introducing a novel hybrid method that unifies pose fitting and body part segmentation on point clouds, enabling mutual enhancement through iterative refinement; and (2) developing a self-supervised technique for fine-tuning segmentation networks using pseudo ground truths derived from fitted models. This work advances the state of the art in human body fitting to point clouds, facilitating more accurate human representations in complex environments and benefiting applications that require precise human modeling. We will make the source code publicly available.",

This is how existing benchmarks built their ground truths, e.g., BEHAVE, EgoBody, InterCap, AGORA. This submission, on the other hand, is completely 3D-based; there is no 2D joint nor part detection involved at all, and yet the reported J2J errors are in a similar range with state-of-the-art 3D pose estimators."

Does 1.86s (BEHAVE) or 1.785s (EgoBody) mean the timing for the whole pipeline? That is, from segmentation, model initialisation, to self-supervised fine-tuning. If some parts are ignored for fair comparison, please state it clearly.\n4. How many iterations of fitting <-> fine-tuning are performed in the experiments? Is it a fixed hyperparameter, or is there some other stopping criteria?"

                "value": "I summarize my questions and concerns here:\n1. Why does the paper fixate so much on relying only on the point clouds for model fitting? All the datasets used in the paper contain RGBD data, so it would be natural to integrate the RGB information into the model. Also, as far as I know, the current SOTA of SMPL model fitting relies largely on multi-view RGB information.\n2. Line 279. How is VPoser used in the optimization? These details seem to be missing from the paper and should be added.\n3. Section 3.6: What is the reasoning behind using a direct assignment of the segmentation using the nearest point on the SMPL model? Would a probabilistic/voting scheme that considers more neighbors and the current assignment of the point not be more robust?\n4. Line 305: \"By training the network on these improved labels, we enable it to generalize better to new, unlabeled data and enhance its segmentation accuracy in diverse scenarios\" -> This is untrue. The paper proposes to use data of a specific dataset and fine-tune the segmentation model on this specific data. This does not naturally lead to better generalization performance, as the segmentation model will be adapted to perform well on this one specific dataset. I suggest changing this sentence to reflect this or adding an experiment that confirms that fine-tuning a model on a single dataset leads to better generalization. If this statement were true, we could finetune the model on the BEHAVE dataset and apply it on the EgoBody dataset to achieve better performance and vice versa. \n5. Table 1. Why does ArtEq perform better on the PosePrior dataset? On PosePrior, ArtEq also takes much longer to optimize than on the other datasets. Does this mean there exists an error on the other evaluations? In contrast, the proposed methods and PTF take always about the same time on all datasets. It seems suspicious that ArtEq does so much better on one dataset but not on the others. Please explain the difference.\n6. How would the proposed approach compare to Multi-view or even single-view methods that use RGB-D data instead of only point clouds?\n7. Table 3. The fact that Human3D does better in some instances than when we do reassignment based on simple nearest neighbor seems to indicate that a probabilistic approach that considers multiple factors would be better."

                "value": "1. The paper is greatly lacking in experimental detail which makes it difficult to evaluate. It's not clear even what data the models were trained on. See `Questions` for elaboration. It is imperative that the authors clarify whether the segmentation model and the baseline methods were trained on the same data. If not, the \"robustness\" claims appear somewhat dubious.\n2. The authors claim \"This enhanced segmentation serves as pseudo ground truth to fine-tune the segmentation network in a self-supervised manner, creating a feedback loop where improvements in pose fitting lead to better segmentation and *vice versa*.\" (emphasis added) but appear to only evaluate the effect of the finetuning on segmentation performance, leaving the pose-fitting portion of the claim seemingly unsubstantiated. Relatedly, the authors should consider changing the paper title as the focus of the work appears to be segmentation, with point-cloud registration appearing primarily as a means.\n3. In the conclusion, the authors write \"This self-supervised cycle enhances the robustness and generalization capabilities of the method across diverse datasets, as shown by our experiments on the PosePrior (Zhang et al., 2021), BEHAVE (Bhatnagar et al., 2022), EgoBody (Zhang et al., 2022), and Hi4D (Yin et al., 2023) datasets,\" highlighting generalization of the segmentation method to Hi4D. However, it must be pointed out that the adaptation method failed on Hi4D, requiring supervised finetuning: \"Furthermore, as Human3D struggles to differentiate between touching instances in Hi4D, we finetune on this dataset before evaluating SegFit.\" The authors seem to forget about this and later attribute high performance on Hi4D to data quality: \"Both Hi4D and PosePrior are very clean datasets with high-quality point clouds and barely any occlusions. Thus, Human3D has already achieved high accuracy, which we cannot improve.\"\n4. The authors have demonstrated improved performance through finetuning the segmentation model on pseudo-ground-truth samples, but do not seem to have evaluated whether the nearest-neighbor segmentations obtained through the registration are more accurate: \"Use the fitted SMPL-X meshes to reassign part labels to the point cloud via nearest-neighbor matching, resulting in enhanced segmentation.\"\n5. The authors' reference to prior work is sloppy and the papers cited often do not match the sentences in which they appear. This includes all citations in the motivation of the work:\n> Fitting a parametric human body model to 3D point cloud data (measured by, e.g., Lidar or Kinect) without contextual guidance can be challenging and often yields imprecise results (Bogo et al., 2016; Kolotouros et al., 2019). However, having prior information about body parts can significantly improve this process (Varol et al., 2017; Zanfir et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020). Thus, this paper focuses on incorporating body part segmentation into the body fitting process.\n\n    The first four referenced works, SMPLify, SPIN, SURREAL, and Zanfir et al. 2018, are image-based HPS methods and do not deal with 3D point-cloud data. GHUM involved point-cloud registration, but it's not clear how it relates to the claim. This continues throughout the paper. As a second example, from the following quote it might be understood that the cited works are quantitatively compared against:\n    > Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both pose modeling accuracy and body part segmentation performance compared to leading methods (Kolotouros et al., 2019; Kocabas et al., 2020; Zanfir et al., 2018), especially in the complicated scenes.\n\n    However, these are image-based HPS works, none of which are compared against nor even could they be."

                "value": "1. What data were the baselines trained on for each experiment?\n2. What data were Human3D trained on for each experiment?\n3. The authors write they \"Fine-tune the Human3D segmentation network using the improved segmentation as pseudo ground truth, enhancing its performance on new data.\" but don't specify what data samples are used for this finetuning. Are the evaluation samples actually \"new\" or do they overlap with the samples that pseudo-ground-truth segmentations are bootstrapped from? If there is overlap, this must be made clear and included in the time calculation.\n4. How many iterations is the \"self-supervised cycle\" applied for?\n5. It is not clear how the segmentations are employed during model fitting. The optimization objective does not seem to contain a segmentation term. Is it just used during initialization and for nothing else? Are segmentations used to filter out points? That there are four options in Table 2 is confusing. The differences between these must be made clear.\n6. Which version of VPoser was employed and what was it trained on? \"To further enforce realistic poses and avoid unnatural articulations, we utilize VPoser, a variational human pose prior trained on a large dataset of human poses.\" Overlap with PosePrior, \"A subset of the AMASS dataset containing complex human poses with limbs extended at extreme angles, posing difficulties for accurate pose,\" would complicate evaluation of generalization.\n\nAdditional Comments:\n1. The authors write \"We make the source code of our method available in a public repository.\" but do not seem to have submitted supplementary materials.\n2. The bibliography is not consistently formatted and includes several duplicate entries.\n3. The authors should have evaluated against LoopReg as its main contribution is self-supervised fitting."
