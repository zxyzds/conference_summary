    "title": "UNAST: Unified framework for Neural Architecture Search for Transformers",
    "abstract": "We introduce the UNAST, a new approach to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) post-training. UNAST combines Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with sparsity and quantization for LLM compression. Starting with a trained model, UNAST replaces layers (e.g., attention and MLP) with more efficient alternatives by adjusting attention heads, KV projection dimensions, and MLP expansion factors. Local distillation pretrains layer candidates to mimic original layers. Scores and costs (latency, number of parameters, etc.) of each operator are fed into an Integer Linear Optimizer to find the optimal architecture under predefined constraints (latency, number of parameters, etc.). Our experiments show that UNAST scales to large models, reducing training costs by up to 10 times compared to training smaller models from scratch. Validation on GPT-3 and LLaMa models demonstrate that UNAST improves latency and memory footprint by up to 60\\% with minimal accuracy loss. UNAST also provides insights into the effects of different compression types on Transformer layers, aiding in the development of non-uniform models.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a neural architecture search method, UNAST, to compress LLMs post training based on the desired model size and latency. \n\nSpecifically, UNAST:\n1. pre-define the search space on the attention and MLP block, like the number of heads and KV dimention of the attention block, and projection dimention of the MLP block and so on. \n2. applies layer-wise knowledge distillation from the original later (techer layer) to the modified layer (student layer), and obtains the scores for various candidates.\n3. selects the highest ranked candidates based on the cumulative accuracy metric, and finetunes the modified models with limited number of tokens.\n\nExtensive experiemnts show some instructive findings:\n1. Modifying the attention block is easier than modifying the MLP block;\n2. Reduing the number of heads is easier than reducing the KV dimentions;\n3. Pruning the first-half layers is easier than the second-half.\n\nThe final pruned LLMs are smaller and faster, and also outperforms or is comparable to various baselines."

                "value": "1. **Poor presentation**: The paper is not easy to follow because of the following problems:\n\n(1) The citation format: Like in L265, the citation looks like \"the zero-shot lm-harness benchmark Gao et al. (2023) accuracies\". For such citation, you should use \\citep{} instead of \\citet{}. I have obsered quite a few such mistake.\n\n(2) The legend in the figures are not well-explained. Taking Figure 4 as an example, I can guess \"att_nh_32_kv_96\" means 32 and 96 refer to the number of attention heads and KV dimentions. But for \"mlp_hs_1_swiglu_1\", I don't really understand the meaning of 1. I suppose it means the dimention factor in the MLP. I believe a well-explained notation is necessary for them. \n\n(3) The experimental section is too messy, I suggest a better structure of results. You should leave more space and explanation to the important results or findings.\n\n(4) Better to highlight some results: In Table 4, it's better to highlight the best results. Otherwise, it's not easy to observe the the improvement of UNAST.\n\n2. **Lack of novelty**: Please correct me if I understand wrongly. UNAST applies NAS to pre-trained LLMs. Compared to previous works that apply NAS to find an optimal architecture and train it from scratch, UNAST tries to find a compact LLM based on a pre-trained LLM. I think such a novelty is not enough for ICLR."

The title is a larger scope (transformer) while the paper mainly focuses on language model. \n\n4.
