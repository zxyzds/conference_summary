    "title": "Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data.\nOur algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques---generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. \nScaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

In the proposed MMD algorithm, a conditional diffusion model is used to generate collision-free trajectories for the robot, and MAPF provides the logic to impose constraints on robots such that it scales in a multi-agent setting. The paper benchmarks with A* search and tests it on multiple multiagent tasks with varying complexity. The results show good success rate and data adherence for the proposed methods."

It is interesting to see how the MPD [1] advantages are utilized in MAPF algorithms. Classical MAPF algorithms usually utilize RRT or PRM planners as underlying collision-avoidance planning. Indeed, utilizing a single-robot MPD model, which typically captures the local multimodality of planning behaviors as a learned smooth collision-avoidance mechanism, is a very interesting idea.\n\n2.  The significance of MMD lies in amortization [2] low-level planning with MPD, which can infer a batch of solution efficiently (i.e., with a forward pass) without RRT or PRM subroutines. This is crucial since high-level multi-agent negotiation may induce many constraints for low-level and thus significantly speed up the overall algorithm.\n\n3. The motivation is well-discussed, and the overall method is presented clearly.\n\n[1] Carvalho, Joao, et al. \"Motion planning diffusion: Learning and planning of robot motions with diffusion models.\" 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

                "value": "1. It is unfortunate that this work does not consider Multi-Robot Planning with Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) [3], which I believe could seamlessly integrate with the MPD framework. [3] utilizes factor-graph formulation to communicate between agents, and it is straightforward to incorporate these signals into the guidance cost term Eq. 4. In contrast, MMD-CBS formulation has combinatoric negotiation between agents inherited from classical MAPF algorithms. There should be some discussions (as future works) on integrating GBP to MMD with potential advantages (e.g., distributed planning over an arbitrary time window, removing combinatoric negotiation via message-passing over factor graph) and disadvantages (e.g., high memory cost with many factors due to increasing trajectory length and number of agents, etc.).\n\n2. The experiment outline is thoughtful and supports the main claims with good metrics and benchmarks. However, I believe the paper would be much stronger if MMD (and its variants) were additionally compared to bare GBP [3] in these benchmarks of Sec 4.2 and the long-horizon setting of Sec 4.3.\n\n[3] Patwardhan, Aalok, Riku Murai, and Andrew J.

This will also shed light implicitly on how well GBP compares to classical MAPF algorithms, which benefits the MAPF community further.
