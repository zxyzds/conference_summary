    "title": "Temporal Visiting-Monitoring Feature Interaction Learning for Modelling Structured Electronic Health Records",
    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patients\u2019 longitudinal visit records, and modelling EHRs can be applied to various clinical prediction tasks. Previous works primarily focus on visit sequences and perform feature interaction on visit-level data to capture patient states. Nonetheless, incorporating finer-grained monitoring sequences simultaneously in structured EHRs, where each visit involves multiple monitoring sessions, can improve prediction performance. However, these studies have not accounted for the relationships between visit-level and monitoring-level data. To fill this gap, we propose an EHRs modelling method aimed at modelling the dynamic interaction between visit-level and monitoring-level data and capturing finer-grained health trends. We first capture the dynamic influence between medical data, and then perform a visiting-monitoring feature interaction on the relationships between visit data and monitoring data, to obtain the representation of patients' state for clinical prediction. We conducted extensive experiments on disease prediction and drug recommendation tasks, with MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly.",

What are the causal assumptions in this work? Why are there only responses from visit to monitoring events? What outcomes are used as targets, and what features are used as confounders? How are such causal assumptions proposed?\n\n3. Can the dataset reflect the insights? MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV are ICU datasets. The monitoring events are within each ICU stay. Do the monitoring events in one ICU stay affect the next visit?\n\n4. Some experiment results are very close. P-values should be reported.\n\n5. The major contribution of this work is about cross-level interactions. However, the authors did not provide any analysis of the interaction results. The information in the t-SNE plot is not straightforward. Why does sparser indicate better results? I would assume forming subclusters is more useful in practice. Besides, the difference in the patient representation plot looks the same to me."

A clearer definition is needed.\n2. The methodology formulation could be enhanced with a detailed figure to improve understanding. Current figures only depict the high-level concept. Figure captions require more detail to be self-explanatory (e.g., Figure 3).\n3. If monitoring data includes lab signals and measurements, this would classify the work as multimodal.

Ideally we want a table of the optimal hyperparameters and the hyperparameter search grid (or if random search, the distributions searched) for every model, including your proposed model and baselines. Did you dedicate roughly equal time to hyperparmeter searching for both your method and your baselines?\n\n- Almost all (except 2) of the baselines are missing monitoring event features, which is a very significant limitation. I think it\u2019s necessary to have at least one simple baseline that has both monitoring events and visit events as features. Based on the fact that most of your sequences have length 1 (and your experiments that show that sequence length doesn't really matter), a very simple feedforward neural network that has access to all features would be a great baseline.\n\n- These are very small datasets, 15k for MIMIC-III and 19k for MIMIC-IV. I am skeptical that this method will continue to provide benefits for larger datasets, as in theory with enough data a deep neural network should be able to automatically learn these interactions. This ties into how even the authors note that the dataset is so small that a single graph layer performs best.\n\n- A major part of the data processing code \u201cpreprocess.drug_recommendation_mimic34_fn\u201d and \u201cpreprocess.diag_prediction_mimic34_fn\u201d is missing. This will make this paper more challenging to reproduce and makes it difficult for me to fully review / understand this paper.\n\n- The improvements in performance are small, and (if I am reading table 1 correctly) are often within a standard deviation of the baselines."
