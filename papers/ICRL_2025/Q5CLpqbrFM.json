    "title": "Learning Representations of Instruments for Partial Identification of Treatment Effects",
    "abstract": "Reliable estimation of treatment effects from observational data is important in many disciplines, such as medicine. However, estimation is challenging when unconfoundedness as a standard assumption in the causal inference literature is violated. In this work, we leverage arbitrary (potentially high-dimensional) instruments to estimate bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a novel approach for partial identification through a mapping of instruments to a discrete representation space so that we yield valid bounds on the CATE. This is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. (2) We derive a two-step method that learns tight bounds using a tailored neural partitioning of the latent instrument space. As a result, we avoid instability issues due to numerical approximations or adversarial training. Furthermore, our procedure aims to reduce the estimation variance in finite-sample settings to yield more reliable estimates. (3) We show theoretically that our procedure obtains valid bounds while reducing estimation variance and we perform experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness across various settings. Overall, our procedure offers a novel path for practitioners to make use of potentially high-dimensional instruments (e.g., as in Mendelian randomization).",

                "value": "This paper provides a method for the partial identification of treatment effects when potentially high-dimensional instruments belonging to a broad class of domains are available. To overcome the potential of overly conservative bounds, it proposes a discrete embedding scheme for the instruments. It provides theoretical results for the validity of the proposed bounds and for estimator efficiency. It provides an empirical evaluation of the method using a well motivated simulated data generating process."

As mentioned in the paper, existing literature focuses on point estimators. Indeed, we can build the confidence interval based on the point estimator. It is well-known that these are two concepts, but it is odds to build bounding estimators present in the paper.\n2. Theorem 2 gives the asymptotic properties of the nuisance estimators $\\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\hat{pi}$ when $\\phi$ is arbitrary. It would be better to study the asymptotic properties of the nuisance estimators due to optimal $\\phi^*$ after Eqn. (8).\n3. It is strange to have $N_b$ in Algorithm 1 (see lines 387, 388).\n4. The auxiliary guidance loss is not clear enough. It would be better if the authors could provide an explicit formula for the loss similar to bandwidth minimization loss and regularization loss.\n5. The size of $k$ should affect the bounded estimators. Please demonstrate a scientific way to choose $k$. In the existing experiments, authors study results for different $k$. In any case, it seems that increasing $k$ would give better results. It should not be correct in general.\n6. Could you provide the results of the following experiment:\nassuming linear generative model, nonlinear ML methods are used to estimate the nuisance functions and then construct the corresponding bandwidth;\nassuming a nonlinear generative model, linear ML methods are used to estimate the nuisance functions and then construct the corresponding bandwidth.\n7. Would the constructed bounding estimators be doubly robust?"
