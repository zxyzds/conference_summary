    "title": "Adaptive Source Localization on Complex Networks via Conditional Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "Network propagation issues like the spread of misinformation, cyber threats, or infrastructure breakdowns are prevalent and have significant societal impacts. Identifying the source of such propagation by analyzing snapshots of affected networks is crucial for managing crises like disease outbreaks and enhancing network security. Traditional methods rely on metrics derived from network topology and are limited to specific propagation models, while deep learning models face the challenge of data scarcity. We propose \\textbf{ASLDiff}~(\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{S}ource \\textbf{L}ocalization \\textbf{Diff}sion Model), a novel adaptive source localization diffusion model to achieve accurate and robust source localization across different network topologies and propagation modes by fusing the principles of information propagation and restructuring the label propagation process within the conditioning module. Our approach not only adapts to real-world patterns easily without abundant fine-tuning data but can also generalize to different network topologies easily. Evaluations of various datasets demonstrate ASLDiff's superior effectiveness, accuracy, and adaptability in real-world applications, showcasing its robust performance across different localization scenarios.

                "value": "The paper introduces ASLDiff, a new method for finding information sources in complex networks. ASLDiff combines diffusion models with information propagation principles to accurately locate sources across different network types and patterns. It uses pre-estimated source locations as guides, a diffusion process led by these estimates, and a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) to capture key propagation details. ASLDiff outperforms certain existing methods, achieving up to 7.5%-12.1% higher accuracy on some real-world datasets and adapting effectively to some networks and scenarios."

The paper does not sufficiently address the scalability of the proposed method for large networks (millions of nodes), which is essential for real-world applications. The largest tested graph contains fewer than 15K nodes.\n\n4. ASLDiff\u2019s performance under the SIS diffusion pattern is inconsistent. Only three datasets are used, with performance varying across datasets and metrics. For instance, there is no improvement in AC on the Net and Jazz networks, and only a marginal increase from 0.984 (GCNSI) to 0.985 on the Power network."

Moreover, despite the thorough survey and preparations of the work, there are many details that need attention. For example, 'Diffusion' instead of 'Diffsion';  Equation (1),  Equation (7) instead of Equation 1,  equation 7. Also, providing code is intended to enhance confidence for your work, but the code is not runnable."

They claim that they can solve problems in various fields, such as disease outbreaks, network security, etc. This is a great plan, however, maybe it is an exaggeration. The spread of infectious diseases and the spread of misinformation vary greatly. Maybe it is too ideal to solve these problems with only one model? This is my main concern for this paper, as complex networks are a very vast and intricate field.\n\nThe author's review is complete, but there are relatively few comparative methods published in the year 2024. Compared with the newest algorithms in the year 2024, can ASLDiff still maintain its advantage?\n\nAfter setting up the required environment for the author's code, I encountered an error stating \"models.guide: No such file or directory.\" I can't verify the results of the model, even though it is impressive."

Sections 2.1 and 3.2 are confusing, as they both seem to explain the IC and LT models redundantly.\n4.

Besides, it seems that you used the conditional diffusion method, but your condition is an approximate solution obtained from LPSI. This usually does not conform to our intuition, and I hope you can elaborate on the rationality of using the approximate solution of LPSI as a condition. And will using approximate solutions as conditions greatly limit the performance of your proposed model? If this impact does not occur, you should provide some theoretical proof. This is evident in the accuracy results, where ASLDiff underperforms compared to LPSI on some metrics.\n \nW2. The description of the method in the paper is unclear, and the innovative aspects of the technical details are not sufficiently articulated. For example, the part of the LPSI advisor that employs the conditional diffusion model lacks an explanation of how the diffusion model introduces innovation for the specific task.\n\nW3. The framework diagrams in the paper are not sufficiently clear. For instance, in Figure 1, the function $f(\\theta)$, which corresponds to the denoising network, is not intuitive. It is suggested to use clearer module diagrams to explain this. Additionally, the input-output relationships in Figure 2 are unclear. For example, the concept of $Y_{label}$ is not explicitly defined in the text, even though the generation method is explained. Further clarification is recommended."
