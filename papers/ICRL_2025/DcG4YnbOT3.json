    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various domains, such as power and weather forecasting. In recent years, different types of models have achieved promising results in long-term time series forecasting. However, these models often produce predictions that lack consistency with the style of the input, resulting in reduced reliability and trust in the forecasts. To address this issue, we propose the Vision-Enhanced Time Series Forecasting by Decomposed Feature Extraction and Composed Reconstruction (VisiTER), which leverages the rich semantic information provided by the image modality to enhance the realism of the predictions. It consists of two main components: the Decomposed Time Series to Image Generation and the Composed Image to Time Series Generation. In the first component, the Decomposed Time Series Feature Extraction Model extracts periodic and trend information, which is then transformed into images using our proposed time series to vision transformation architecture. After converting the input time series into images, the resulting images are used as style features and concatenated with the previously extracted features. In the second component, we use our proposed TimeIR along with the previously obtained feature set to perform image reconstruction for the prediction part. Due to the rich information provided, the reconstructed images exhibit better consistency with the input images, which are then transformed back into time series. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that VisiTER achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on both traditional metrics and new metrics.",

Specifically, it is unclear what key differences between image and time series modalities justify the use of ViT. For instance, while the order/position of image patches is irrelevant, the temporal order of time series data is crucial. This distinction needs further elaboration.\n3.\tThe paper omits some commonly-used datasets, such as Traffic and Solar-Energy.

Given that the reported results claim state-of-the-art performance, evidence supporting this claim is necessary."

                "value": "1.Compared to traditional methods that directly map time series data to scatter plots and then reconstruct them, this paper proposes the T2V method. By diffusing and continuousizing the scatter points, the generated images are more suitable as inputs for image models. Additionally, the introduction of multiple Swin Transformer Blocks in the TimeIR model allows the model to better focus on the detailed information of the time series. This approach leverages the rich information in the image modality, enabling the model to capture complex relationships more effectively.\n\n2.The paper introduces the DTFE module, which effectively extracts periodic and trend features, thereby enhancing the model's performance. This module can efficiently handle the periodic and trend characteristics of time series data and convert them into image form for reconstruction, improving the accuracy and stability of the reconstruction results.\n\n3.The introduction of the TimeIR model enables more efficient utilization of periodic, trend, and style features for image reconstruction, which is crucial for time series prediction. This model enhances the overall predictive capabilities of the system.\n\n4.Experimental results show that the VisiTER model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. Moreover, the authors use the SSIM metric to evaluate the similarity between the generated time series images and the actual time series. The results indicate that the VisiTER model also performs exceptionally well in terms of SSIM, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness."

                "value": "1.Lack of Motivation for Image Transformation. The authors do not provide sufficient justification for the advantages of converting time series data into images for the forecasting task. There is a lack of ablation studies to explore the motivation behind this transformation, which weakens the argument for its necessity.\n\n2.The concept of \"style features\" in the context of time series tasks is somewhat abstract and not clearly defined. This lack of clarity makes it difficult for readers to understand the relevance and reasonableness of these features, potentially undermining the credibility of the approach.\n\n3.The introduction of the SSIM metric seems to lack a strong rationale. While SSIM is useful for evaluating image quality, its relevance and significance in the context of time series prediction are not well justified. This raises concerns about the appropriateness of using such an image-based metric for this specific task.\n\n4.The authors could enhance the robustness of their method by treating the image reconstruction component as a plug-in module and applying it to other existing baseline models. This would help to determine whether the image reconstruction approach can improve the performance of different models, providing stronger evidence for its effectiveness."
