    "title": "PIORF: Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow for Long\u2013Range Interactions in Mesh Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Recently, data-driven simulators based on graph neural networks have gained attention in modeling physical systems on unstructured meshes. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier--Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier--Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2\\% improvement.",

                "value": "In this paper, authors propose Physics-Informed Ollivier\u2013Ricci Flow (PIORF) which builds on the Ollivier\u2013Ricci Flow. This innovative rewiring method integrates physical correlations with graph topology to address the over-squashing problem, which traditional approaches often overlook by focusing solely on graph topology without considering underlying physical phenomena. The proposed method is designed with the following 3 goals: 1) physical context, 2) efficiency, 3) accuracy. Furthermore, authors extend the ORC to node-level curvature, which is the core of the RIOFR. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods."

And authors complain that 'BORF works in batches and calculates the curvature with a minimum and maximum in each batch. Then, connections are added to the set with the minimum edge value to uniformly weaken the graph bottleneck. To save computation time, BORF does not recalculate the graph curvature within each batch, but rather reuses the already computed optimal transfer plan between sets to determine which edges should be added.', but there is no indication in this paper that there is an increase in efficiency compared to BORF\n\n2(W1). The addition of edges also changes the topology, which may lead to negative consequences that are not addressed in the paper.\n\n3(W1). Computational efficiency is demonstrated only through experimental illustrations of efficiency gains, with no accompanying theoretical analysis.\n\n4(W1). Contrary to the existing theory. Topping's work [2] suggests that a fully connected graph does not have over-squashing (maximum curvature). However, as shown in Figure 3(a), the authors claim that the degree of a node is negatively correlated with curvature. These two theories are clearly contradictory. The authors should clarify whether this discrepancy arises from specific conditions discussed in the context of fluid dynamics. The degree may not be correlated to the level of curvature.\n\n5(W2). There is no clear rationale for why adding edges between $s$ and $r$ would address the underlying physical phenomena. The authors only provide some intuitive insights from physics and experimental simulations, but these edges could potentially have a negative impact.\n\n6(W3). Legends should be provided, and the meanings of the colors should be clarified to help readers better understand the impact of color changes in the figures (Figure 1, 4, 7, 8, 9,10 11).\n\n[1] Khang Nguyen, Nong Minh Hieu, Vinh Duc Nguyen, Nhat Ho, Stanley Osher, and Tan Minh Nguyen.

The basic idea is to combine regions based on both graph topology (Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC)) and physical features defined on each graph node (e.g. velocity). The proposed method first identifies bottleneck regions, i.e., with low ORC at the nodes, and then connects them with nodes having a maximum difference in physical properties. It seems that the first step identifies well-connected graph clusters typically far away on the graph and then connects them through basically one or two other nodes, namely the one(s) having the lowest and/or highest chosen physical feature. This way, information can propagate quickly between distant regions. The presented experiments seem promising."

                "value": "- **W1: Why ORC?** I get the point of wanting to connect clusters (according to the used library for computing the ORC, low ORC reveals \"bridges within clusters\": https://pypi.org/project/GraphRicciCurvature/), but I'm not convinced that this is the best way. Note that I don't say that it is not the right way, I just say that there is no discussion of alternatives. \n- **W2: Why not node degree?** If the ORC and the degree of a node are strongly correlated, there should not be much difference between using the degree of a node versus a low ORC. I strongly recommend ablating this design choice (**Ablation 1**). If both perform comparably, there is no reason to use ORC, as the degree of a node is a much simpler concept. Thus, Occam's razor would favor it, and talking about adaptation by other researchers, one would not have to use a separate library to compute curvatures.\n- **W3: 6.4 Ablations.** I was not expecting this amount of ablations regarding the second half of your algorithm (lines 5-6 of Algorithm 1, physical features), but I was definitely expecting more ablations regarding the first part (lines 3-4 of Algorithm 1, ORC). In particular, how about randomly picking $S$ nodes instead of the current lines 5-6 of the algorithm relying on the ORC (**Ablation 2**)? This would show the importance of using physical features for rewiring, which seems to be a major part of the approach.\n- **W4: Simplest baseline.** I appreciate your effort in the model comparison part! However, I'm missing the simplest possible rewiring technique: randomly pick the same number of bidirectional edges as you use ($S$ if I'm not missing something), and see how this model performs (**Ablation 3**). From what I know, the chosen baselines (DIGL, SDRF, etc.) are designed for very different downstream tasks, and I'm not surprised that they underperform.\n\nI'll be more than happy to increase my score upon adding the suggested Ablations 1-3.\n\n**Minor/Typos:**\n- L. 376: \"changes\" -> \"change\"?\n- L. 425: \"boxe\" -> \"boxes\"?\n- L. 462:  \"PIORF maintains the lowest computation time in all datasets and edge counts.\" Is this true? The orange FoSR line is nearly identical; by the way, it is also pretty hard to see the orange line, probably even impossible if I print the manuscript on paper -> please think of a better visualization (e.g. log y-axis?). Please fix the whole paragraph regarding which approach is \"the fastest\", as there seem to be two of them."
