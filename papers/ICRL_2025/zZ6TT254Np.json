    "title": "Synthesizing Realistic fMRI: A Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Efficient fMRI Acquisition",
    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping brain activity but faces challenges like lengthy acquisition time and sensitivity to patient movement, limiting its clinical and machine learning applications. While generative models such as diffusion models can synthesize fMRI signals to alleviate these issues, they often underperform due to neglecting the brain's complex structural and dynamic properties.\nTo address these limitations, we propose the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model, a novel framework integrating two key brain physiological properties into the diffusion process: brain hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics. \nTo model complex interactions among brain regions, we construct hypergraphs based on the prior knowledge of brain functional parcellation reflected by resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). This enables the aggregation of fMRI signals across multiple scales and generates hierarchical signals. \nAdditionally, by incorporating the prediction of two key dynamics properties of fMRI\u2014the multifractal spectrum and generalized Hurst exponent\u2014our framework effectively guides the diffusion process, ensuring the preservation of the scale-invariant characteristics inherent in real fMRI data.\nOur framework employs progressive diffusion generation, with signals representing broader brain region information conditioning those that capture localized details, and unifies multiple inputs during denoising for balanced integration.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model generates physiologically realistic fMRI signals, potentially reducing acquisition time and enhancing data quality, benefiting clinical diagnostics and machine learning in neuroscience.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel approach for generating realistic fMRI data using diffusion models, specifically designed to account for regional interactions and spectral features of the brain. The model captures regional connectivity in a hierarchical structure, where fine-scale signals are conditioned on larger-scale signals. To learn spectral features, it incorporates loss functions that capture fractal characteristics. Results demonstrate improved performance over existing time-series forecasting and diffusion-based models. Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each model component."

Clarification on data split (e.g., train/test division, sample counts) is also required. If the codebase will not be provided, the paper should include a detailed description of the network architecture (such as layer specifications and activation functions) and the training setup for benchmark methods in an appendix.\n2.

The authors have developed an innovative framework that captures complex interdependencies and multifractal dynamics within synthetic fMRI signals.\n\nSpecifically, their contribution includes integrating three key components into the diffusion process: a hypergraph-based signal generator, a dynamics properties guiding module, and a cross-brain region progressive diffusion model. This integration enhances the realism of the generated signals. The authors provide a robust theoretical foundation for their methods and perform extensive quantitative analysis, demonstrating the framework\u2019s accuracy and effectiveness in time series forecasting. The paper is well-organized and includes relevant background information. Results from the proposed method outperform multiple peer models in time-series forecasting and diffusion models, as evidenced by superior MAE, MAPE, and RMSE scores, highlighting the model\u2019s effectiveness."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The reviewers have multiple concerns about the framework and potential impact in this work. \n\n1). The confusion about physiological fMRI. Usually, fMRI are categorized into resting-state and task-based fMRI. The resting-state fMRI is commonly scanned without specific stimulus, whereas task-based fMRI is acquired based on external stimulus, such as 7 tasks in HCP. Is physiological fMRI is either resting-state or task-based signal? The authors do not clarify the concept even in Introdcution section.\n\n2). Limited motivation and impact. In Abstract, the authors mentioned \"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping brain activity but faces challenges like lengthy acquisition time and sensitivity to patient movement, limiting its clinical and machine learning applications.\" It seems that the authros' work can advance the fMRI for clincial application, but the authors do not generate some neurological or psychiatric fMRI to validate. From reviewers' perspective, using the innovative PDH-Diffusion model, it can assist physician to provide lengthy fMRI signal which will denfinitely reduce the inconvenience of patients. Only generating healthy fMRI can impair the motivation and impact of this work.\n\n3). Lacking of qualitative comparison. The authors have provided an extensive quantitative validation of PDH-Diffusion model with other peer methods using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Unfortunately, the autors do not provide any qualitative results, such as Functional Connectivity Map or Brain Connectivity Maps, of PDH-Diffusion. That is, although averaging metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE across 10 runs may demonstrate robustness, these metrics  cannot fully capture the quality or realism of the synthesized fMRI signals. Notably, the qualitative results is also vital in clinics, since these results showcase which brain regions are severly impaired by neurological disorders.  Importantly, there is no visual representation given of the generated fMRI signal, which would be valuable for assessing their plausibility. \n\n4). Several technical issues. The variance schedule (parameters $\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) in the diffusion process may not be fully optimized for different regions or scales, potentially leading to inappropriate noise levels in certain hierarchical levels. This could result in over-smoothing or overfitting at certain levels. Additionally, conditioning on historical data could lead to overfitting if the model becomes too dependent on past values, especially if the training data does not represent the full spectrum of brain dynamics. Without explicit mitigation measures, such as adaptive variance schedules or regularization techniques, these issues may limit the model\u2019s ability to generalize to new or varied patterns, impacting its robustness and effectiveness.\n\n5). Multiple typographical mistakes. In Section 4.3 (ABLATION ANALYSIS) there are many typographical errors. The term \u201cshare radio\u201d is used instead of \u2018share ratio\u2019 in \u201cThe influence of share radio\u201d this section. Similar typographical errors appear in the caption and text of Figure 3(b), as well as in Section 3.4. These typographical mistakes impair the redability of this paper."

Qualitative Comparisons: The authors are strongly encouraged to provide qualitative comparisons between the synthesized and real fMRI signals to allow for a qualitative assessment of the model\u2019s performance.\n\n2). Optimal Range of Brain Regions: The results suggest an \u201coptimal\u201d range of brain regions that enhances performance. How is this range determined, and is it manually set? Reviewers are concerned about the reliance on manual design for determining this optimal range.\n\n3). Validation of Multifractal Properties: How do the authors validate that the generated signals preserve multifractal properties?\n\n4). Risk of Overfitting: Do the variance schedule parameters ($\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) and the historical data used in training the PDH-Diffusion model lead to overfitting?"

If my speculation in the former question is right, it is counter-intuitive that forecasting more time points (96 vs. 32) did not lead to an increase in errors. Please clarify this. \n3. According to Fig 1, it looks like the resolution of synthesized data is bounded to the level of ROI. It is more desirable to synthesize fMRI dynamics at the level of vertex. Is the proposed method able to be applied at the vertex level as well?     \n4. In line 451, please double check the definition of MAE."
