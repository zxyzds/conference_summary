    "abstract": "To overcome computational challenges of Optimal Transport (OT), several variants of Sliced Wasserstein (SW) has been developed in the literature. These approaches exploit the closed-form expression of the univariate OT by projecting measures onto one-dimensional lines. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL) has emerged as a promising alternative that replaces these lines with a more intricate structure called tree systems. The tree structures enhance the ability to capture topological information of the metric while preserving computational efficiency. However, at the core of TSW-SL, the splitting maps, which serve as the mechanism for pushing forward measures onto tree systems, focus solely on the position of the measure supports while disregarding the projecting domains. Moreover, the specific splitting map used in TSW-SL leads to a metric that is not invariant under Euclidean transformations, a typically expected property for OT on Euclidean space. In this work, we propose a novel class of splitting maps that generalizes the existing one studied in TSW-SL enabling the use of all positional information from input measures, resulting in a novel Distance-based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (Db-TSW) distance. In addition, we introduce a simple tree sampling process better suited for Db-TSW, leading to an efficient GPU-friendly implementation for tree systems, similar to the original SW. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of proposed class of splitting maps to verify the injectivity of the corresponding Radon Transform, and demonstrate that Db-TSW is an Euclidean invariant metric. We empirically show that Db-TSW significantly improves accuracy compared to recent SW variants while maintaining low computational cost via a wide range of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models.",

Unlike traditional Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances, which can lose topological information, Db-TSW incorporates tree structures and a novel class of E(d)-invariant splitting maps to maintain metric consistency under Euclidean transformations. This approach also includes a new tree sampling method for efficiency, enabling GPU-friendly implementations. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, Db-TSW is shown to outperform recent SW variants on tasks such as gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative modeling, while remaining computationally efficient\u200b."

I am curious about how effectively Db-TSW captures these spatial variations. Is there a way to demonstrate this? Could you provide an example where Db-TSW might fail to capture them?"

Both of these are good practices in general, and also used in [2], which is cited in the paper.\n\nW3: The paper would benefit from a detailed discussion on various instances of tree systems and especially splitting maps (which are directly related to the primary contributions). For instance, using $k$ concurrent lines with shared root is fast but what are we sacrificing? Are they quantifiable? Softmax works well as an E(d)-invariant splitting map but what are some other instances (along with pros and cons)?  Along those lines, a stronger ablation section would be helpful. It should clearly demonstrate that any performance gain is due to the novel technical contributions to support the paper's claims throughout (is it the invariance or the proposed tree structure that gives better performance?). How much is the gain if one adjusts $L,k, \\delta$ for datasets of varying complexity? What about root sampling? Since the design space includes various components, that would help practitioners in making sensible design choices for their applications.\n\nW4: The paper would be strengthened if explicitly discussing sample/projection complexity, and also error bounds, convergence rate for MC approximation.\n\nW5: What are the authors' rationales for not using a consistent set of baseline methods to evaluate relative performance across tasks?

Is this result also true in higher-dimensional settings, and can you provide an explanation for this interesting behavior?\n- It is stated in the introduction that Dd-TSW enables a highly parallelizable implementation, and in Section 6, it mentions \"*that enables an algorithm with linear runtime and high parallelizability, keeping the wall-clock time of Dd-TSW and Dd-TSW\u22a5 approximately equal to that of vanilla SW and surpassing some SW variants*.\" Do the reported timings in section 6 relate to the parallel implementation?\n- In the conclusion, it is mentioned that improved performance is expected by adapting recent advanced sampling schemes or techniques from SW to TSW-SL.

Thus, the authors propose to take these two observations into account in order to define a new projection (Radon transform) on trees with a splitting map which is invariant w.r.t translation and rotations, and which takes into account the trees. Their new Radon transform is shown to be injective provided that the splitting map is invariant w.r.t Euclidean transformation. Then, they propose a splitting map which satisfies this, as well as two new more efficient ways to sample trees.
