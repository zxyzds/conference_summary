    "title": "Toward Generalizability of Graph-based Imputation on Biomedical Tabular-based Missing Data",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in graph-based imputation methods for addressing missing data have received considerable attention, primarily for their ability to effectively aggregate and propagate information through graph structures. However, the applicability of these methods to the tabular domain remains constrained by two main factors: the lack of task-relevant graph structure and a lack of consideration of feature-wise relationships. To address these challenges, we introduce GRASS, a novel approach that effectively bridges the gap between existing graph-based imputation methods and the unique needs of tabular domains with initially missing data. To derive feature gradient, GRASS initiates with training a Multi-Layer Perceptron layer on tabular data. This gradient then facilitates the creation of graph structures from a feature (column) perspective, enabling column-wise feature propagation for imputing missing values, followed by uncertainty-aware categorical clamping. Finally, to effectively utilize existing graph-based imputation methods in an agnostic manner, we input a so-called warmed-up matrix along with an associated sample (row) graph. We validate GRASS on real-world tabular datasets, including those from the bio, medical, and social domains, demonstrating its ability to unlock the potential of graph-based imputation methods across various missing data scenarios.",

                "value": "This paper proposes an approach for classification on tabular datasets with missing data. The proposed method, GRASS, is designed to generate a graph structure that is used in downstream learning with graph-based imputation methods. GRASS first obtains feature gradients by training an MLP layer and performs column-wise feature propagation. After uncertainty-aware categorical clamping, GRASS builds the graph structure using kNN connections."

It is well known in tabular data learning that tree-based methods, including CatBoost and XGBoost, are generally more effective than deep learning-based approaches [[1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/0378c7692da36807bdec87ab043cdadc-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2021.11.011)]. Comparisons with methods known to perform well in tabular data classification are entirely omitted. A comparison table with those methods should be included to substantiate the claim that GRASS performs well in the biomedical tabular domain. At the very least, I believe neural networks specialized for classification on tabular data [[3](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/hash/9d86d83f925f2149e9edb0ac3b49229c-Abstract.html)] should have been included in the comparison. Isn\u2019t this paper aiming to argue that graph-based imputation using GRASS, which incorporates GNN in the process, is effective for classification on tabualar data containing missing features? If so, graph-based imputation using GRASS should be compared to the current state-of-the-art methods in tabular data learning. The performance when commonly used data imputation and tree-based methods are applied, as well as the performance when using the graph-based imputation using GRASS, should be compared and discussed in this study."
