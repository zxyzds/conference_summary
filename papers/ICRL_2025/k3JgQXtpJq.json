    "title": "Physics3D: Learning Physical Properties of 3D Gaussians via Video Diffusion",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been rapid development in 3D generation models, opening up new possibilities for applications such as simulating the dynamic movements of 3D objects and customizing their behaviors. However, current 3D generative models tend to focus only on surface features such as color and shape, neglecting the inherent physical properties that govern the behavior of objects in the real world. To accurately simulate physics-aligned dynamics, it is essential to predict the physical properties of materials and incorporate them into the behavior prediction process. Nonetheless, predicting the diverse materials of real-world objects is still challenging due to the complex nature of their physical attributes. In this paper, we propose Physics3D, a novel method for learning various physical properties of 3D objects through a video diffusion model. Our approach involves designing a highly generalizable physical simulation system based on a viscoelastic material model, which enables us to simulate a wide range of materials with high-fidelity capabilities. Moreover, we distill the physical priors from a video diffusion model that contains more understanding of realistic object materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both elastic and plastic materials. Physics3D shows great potential for bridging the gap between the physical world and virtual neural space, providing a better integration and application of realistic physical principles in virtual environments.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a framework for inferring the physical properties of a 3DGS reconstructed scene by leveraging video model priors. This approach builds upon PhysDreamer by Zhang et al. (2024) by incorporating more complex MPM simulations and utilizing video-based SDS. Given a boundary condition, the 3DGS is deformed following PhysGaussian Xie et al. (2024) using MPM simulation. The rendered video by 3DGS renderer is then fed into Stable Video Diffusion to evaluate SDS. The SDS loss guides the optimization of physical parameters such that the generated video matches the reality learned by the pretrained SVD model."

(2024): incorporating viscoelasticity into the MPM simulation and using SDS instead of reference videos to optimize physical parameters. However, viscoelasticity modeling itself is not a novel contribution (see my question below). It remains unclear whether the observed improvements stem primarily from the use of a more sophisticated simulator or from the SDS optimization. Since the primary contribution here is the use of SDS optimization, it is essential to provide evidence that the improvements are indeed due to SDS optimization rather than the simulator's enhanced capabilities."

The 1D rheological model depicted in Figure 2 and the 3D finite strain multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in Figure 3 align precisely with Figure 4 in [1]. However, this framework for modeling viscoelasticity is claimed as a contribution here, which does not seem appropriate. \n\n- The elastoplastic modeling (Line 281 - 300) is exactly copied from [2]: the choice of base elastic model (fixed-corotated elasticity), the notation of $\\theta_c, \\theta_s$ are identical. But there is no reference to [2] included there. \n\n- The viscoelastic modeling (Line 306-323) is exactly copied from [1]: the choice of base elastic model (stVK elasticity), the expression of trial strain $\\epsilon_N$ are identical.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Could the authors break down the quantitative results into each sample? Since different real-world test examples and synthetic samples can represent various types of material, arranging the quantitative results into a table at the instance level can demonstrate the superiority of Physics3D.\n2. Could the authors add Frechet Video and Inception Distance metrics for quantitative evaluation following PhysDreamer[a]? The metrics used in the paper are low-level pixel-wise error evaluations. However, all the existing test samples do not have too many dynamics, and most of the pixels in the background are static, which leads to marginal quantitative improvement in PSNR and SSIM. Maybe the high-level semantic evaluation results can make the performance of Physics3D more convincing and distinguishable.\n3. The reviewer is a little concerned about whether the material modeling will degrade the capacity of the visual modeling of 3D Gaussian. According to the `carnation` result in Fig.5, only Physics3D fails to model the white texture of the left curtain. So, the reviewer suggests that the authors can compare synthetic datasets, e.g., fitting the same object model with different texture mapping (like checkboard) by different methods.\n4. Could the authors add the quantitative ablation of the learnable internal filling strategy in PSNR/SSIM/FID/FVD? The authors should provide sufficient results to ensure the effectiveness of their contribution.\n5. How sensitive is Physics3D to the simulation sub-step compared with other martial modeling? If the elastoplastic + viscoelastic can achieve more robust dynamics, the improvement in training efficiency can also contribute to Physics3D. Perhaps the authors could test this on substep durations of 1e-3 to 1e-5 seconds.\n6. Could the authors add the material visualization following PhysDreamer[a] by using heat maps? Although the quantitative results show that Physics3D can achieve the best visual quality, the reviewer thinks the author should visualize the material property of the fitting results to demonstrate the plausible material distribution learned by Physics3D.\n\nReference:\n[a] Zhang, Tianyuan, et al. \"Physdreamer: Physics-based interaction with 3d objects via video generation.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.

A contribution of this paper is the introduction of it into the ML community.\n\n- Section 4.2 should clarify that the clampping elastoplasticity model comes from Stomakhin et al 2013. It should also clarify that this model is non-physical and invented for snow animation. A more physically grounded elastoplasticity model would be models like von Mises and Drucker Prager, with proper references of mpm literature for those models.\n\n- I\u2019m not exactly getting Figure 11. The bread has not been torn apart. Why do the internal particles matter?\n\n- What\u2019s the text input for fig 4 video diffusion model?\n\n- line 426: \u201c1e-4\u201d -> \u201c10^{-4}\u201d\n\n- The comparisions with PhysGaussian needs to specify the parameters used and how they are chosen. It is unfair to pick a bad parameter that makes the motion bad, and call the method or the model  \u201cunrealistic\u201d. You can say that the manual tuning is time-consuming, and diffusion models allow you to automatically get good parameters. Please modify similar statments about physgaussian throughout the paper.\n\n- I don\u2019t quite understand the experienmnt in Figure 6. The ball is supposed to be elastic wihtout permanent deformations. Why do you need to turn on plasticity for this one?
