    "abstract": "An essential component of event reconstruction in particle physics experiments is identifying the trajectory of charged particles in the detector.   Traditional methods for track finding are often complex, and tailored to specific detectors and input  geometries, limiting their adaptability to new detector designs and optimization processes.\nTo overcome these limitations, we present a novel, end-to-end track finding algorithm that is detector-agnostic and can take into account multiple input geometric types. To achieve this, our approach unifies  inputs from multiple sub-detectors and detector types into a single geometric algebra representation, simplifying data handling compared to traditional methods.\nThen, we leverage an equivariant graph neural network, GATr, to perform track finding across all data from an event simultaneously. \nWe validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on various detector concepts with different technologies for the FCC-ee at CERN, specifically the IDEA and CLD  detectors.\nThis work generalizes track finding across  diverse types of input geometric data and  tracking technologies, facilitating the development of innovative detector concepts, accelerating detector development cycles, and enabling comprehensive detector optimization.",

                "value": "This paper works on a very unique application of machine learning, related to event trajectory reconstruction for particle physics experiments. Although work has been done on solving this problem in the past with machine learning, this work is detector agnostic. They heavily rely on a previously published graphical learning work, GATr, and modify it to suit their needs."

The presentation isn\u2019t very clear and I failed to understand the technically novel aspects of this paper. A decent portion of the paper (e.g. Figs. 1,2 ) doesn\u2019t add anything to my understanding of the technically novel machine learning aspects of this paper.\n- A lot of the time they refer the readers to read other papers to understand further important details of their paper. When writing papers, it is indeed very difficult to determine how much do the authors need to explain wrt the past works. However, in this situation, they could have used the space available to write more detailed explanations of their works.

I understand that this work is trying to do temporal graphical structure prediction, but it needs a few more details regarding what category it falls under: multi-modal learning? multi-Domain learning? Multi-stream learning? Data preprocessing and transformation? Cyclic time-series event detection? Etc.\n- Please make it way more clear what losses are being used to train which aspects of their Graphical NN. Also, how the representations learned are being used to at run time to reconstruct the trajectories? Fig. 3 is supposed to do that but it is not helping at all."
