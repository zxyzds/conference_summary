    "title": "No Location Left Behind: Measuring and Improving the Fairness of Implicit Representations for Earth Data",
    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) exhibit growing promise in addressing Earth representation challenges, ranging from emissions monitoring to climate modeling. However, existing methods disproportionately prioritize global average performance, whereas practitioners require fine-grained insights to understand biases and variations in these models. To bridge this gap, we introduce FAIR-Earth: a first-of-its-kind dataset explicitly crafted to challenge and examine inequities in Earth representations. FAIR-Earth comprises various high-resolution Earth signals, and uniquely aggregates extensive metadata along stratifications like landmass size and population density to assess the fairness of models. Evaluating state-of-the-art INRs across the various modalities of FAIR-Earth, we uncover striking performance disparities. Certain subgroups, especially those associated with high-frequency signals (e.g., islands, coastlines), are consistently poorly modeled by existing methods. In response, we propose spherical wavelet encodings, building on previous spatial encoding research for INRs. Leveraging the multi-resolution analysis capabilities of wavelets, our encodings yield more consistent performance over various scales and locations, offering more accurate and robust representations of the biased subgroups. These open-source contributions represent a crucial step towards facilitating the equitable assessment and deployment of implicit Earth representations.",

                "value": "The paper introduces a new set of datasets called FAIR-EARTH, aimed at addressing and assessing fairness in Earth science. FAIR-EARTH encompasses various types of data, including environmental factors and emissions, while also taking geographical features and population density into account. Experimental results demonstrate that existing spherical harmonics methods fail to maintain accurate local performance, particularly regarding land and sea masses. To address this issue, the authors propose using spherical Morlet wavelets to correct localized biases. Results indicate that this approach outperforms existing methods in most situations."

It is known that correctly parameterizing elements like wave number and scaling factors for specific resolutions are necessary to reach the best performance. The authors should conduct experiments to illustrate the trade-offs associated with using spherical wavelets.\n\n2. Since spherical wavelet is well-defined at poles, what should we do for poles? Would there exist bias in poles?\n\n3. Implementing spherical wavelet encodings requires a more complex parameter selection and may need more computation. Efficiency evaluation should be considered for using spherical wavelets\n\n4. While FAIR-EARTH can address some bias for the ill-represented areas like landmasses, authors should detail the weakness/flexibility of this combination approach. What kind of dataset can be integrated if there is temporal bias or learning representation for poles?"
