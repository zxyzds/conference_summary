    "title": "Crafting Zero-Cost Proxy Metrics for Neural Architecture Search via Symbolic Regression",
    "abstract": "Using zero-cost (ZC) metrics to estimate network performance instead of relying on expensive training processes has proven both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, a significant limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Additionally, the design of current ZC metrics is manual, which is a lengthy trial-and-error process and requires expert knowledge to develop ZC metrics effectively. These challenges raise two questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a better one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to network performance across multiple problems within just a few minutes. Extensive experiments on 13 problems in NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero, covering various search spaces and tasks, demonstrate the superiority of our automatically designed proxies over hand-crafted ones. By integrating our proxy metrics into an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify a network architecture with comparable performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset within 15 minutes using a single GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.",

Their combination is somewhat novel but in light of the following points may not be sufficient.\n- The claim \"Our framework can synthesize a new ZC metric within only 10 minutes\" is incorrect because the framework requires the calculation of the high-level ZC metrics which serve as input features, and therefore, the actual total time is the time required by each high-level ZC metric plus 10 mins. The same comment applies to the results in Table 4.\n- The proposed ZC metric, while using existing ZC metrics, doesn't outright outperform these metrics (see Fig. 6), and in NAS, is outperformed by a number of existing NAS methods based on ZC metrics (see Table 4)\n- No ImageNet results reported."
