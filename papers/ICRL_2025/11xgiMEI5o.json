    "title": "OmniRe: Omni Urban Scene Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "We introduce OmniRe, a comprehensive system for efficiently creating high-fidelity digital twins of dynamic real-world scenes from on-device logs. Recent methods using neural fields or Gaussian Splatting primarily focus on vehicles, hindering a holistic framework for all dynamic foregrounds demanded by downstream applications, e.g., the simulation of human behavior. OmniRe extends beyond vehicle modeling to enable accurate, full-length reconstruction of diverse dynamic objects in urban scenes. Our approach builds scene graphs on 3DGS and constructs multiple Gaussian representations in canonical spaces that model various dynamic actors, including vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and others. OmniRe allows holistically reconstructing any dynamic object in the scene, enabling advanced simulations (~60 Hz) that include human-participated scenarios, such as pedestrian behavior simulation and human-vehicle interaction. This comprehensive simulation capability is unmatched by existing methods. Extensive evaluations on the Waymo dataset show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively by a large margin. We further extend our results to 5 additional popular driving datasets to demonstrate its generalizability on common urban scenes. We will make the code and data publicly available.",

                "value": "OmniRe is a framework designed to create high-fidelity digital twins of dynamic urban scenes for simulations, particularly for applications in autonomous driving. OmniRe goes beyond vehicle modeling to support diverse dynamic actors like pedestrians and cyclists, enabling complex simulations that reflect real-world scenarios. It utilizes Gaussian Scene Graphs with multiple representations, allowing detailed and editable scene reconstructions with both rigid (e.g., vehicles) and non-rigid (e.g., pedestrians) actors."

                "value": "Comprehensive Dynamic Modeling: OmniRe can handle various actors in urban settings, unlike most previous methods that focus mainly on vehicles.\n\nScene Graphs and Gaussian Splatting: The system uses 3D Gaussian splatting for detailed scene and object rendering, including control over each object.\n\nHuman Behavior Simulation: Through SMPL modeling, OmniRe accurately reconstructs human motions, even in cluttered environments, enabling simulations of interactions between pedestrians and vehicles.\n\nState-of-the-Art Performance: Extensive testing on datasets like Waymo and others show OmniRe significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of visual fidelity and reconstruction accuracy."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are several limitations in OmniRe approach, which are correctly identified in the paper too.\n\nLighting Effects: OmniRe doesn\u2019t model lighting variations explicitly. This can lead to visual inconsistencies when combining scene elements with differing lighting conditions, which may reduce realism in certain simulations. Addressing this would require additional modeling of lighting dynamics.\n\nNovel View Synthesis Limitations: OmniRe\u2019s per-scene optimization approach struggles to generate satisfactory results when the camera view deviates significantly from the training trajectories. This could be a limitation for scenarios requiring a wide range of viewing angles, such as free navigation through the reconstructed scenes. The authors suggest incorporating data-driven priors or generative models as future work to address this.\n\nComputational Complexity: While the method achieves high-quality reconstructions, the complexity of the Gaussian Scene Graph and the joint optimization of multiple parameters (pose, appearance, etc.) require substantial computational resources. Training time per scene, though optimized for an RTX 4090 GPU, could still pose scalability issues for large datasets or continuous real-time simulation needs.\n\nChallenges with Real-Time Adaptability: The method\u2019s reliance on SMPL modeling for human actors and per-node deformation fields, though effective, might introduce delays in real-time applications, particularly if scenes are highly dynamic or involve many non-rigid actors."
