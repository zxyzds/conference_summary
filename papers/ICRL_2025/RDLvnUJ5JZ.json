    "title": "TF-score: Time-series Forecasting using score-based diffusion model",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, capable of synthesizing high-quality images by capturing complex underlying patterns. Building on this success, these models have been adapted for time-series forecasting, a domain characterized by intricate temporal dependencies. However, most existing works have focused primarily on empirical performance without sufficient theoretical exploration. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a generalized loss function within the diffusion-based forecasting framework. Leveraging this foundation, we introduce TF-score, a score-based diffusion model designed to capture the interdependencies between historical data and future predictions. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets show that TF-score consistently surpasses leading baselines, including prior diffusion-based models. Furthermore, we extend existing guidance sampling strategies into a our score-based formulation, achieving performance gains across multiple datasets while providing a detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved.",

This leaves limited space to discuss their own contributions, making the paper feel more like a course report than a research paper.\n\n\u200b2. **Lack of Innovation**: The paper appears to mainly apply existing conditional generation diffusion models to time-series forecasting tasks, with limited novelty. The only new element is the mask vector, which seems overly simplistic. Only about one-fifth of a page out of the 10-page main text is dedicated to introducing this new method, and this so-called new method merely adds a weight mask when calculating the sequence loss. Besides, the section that introduces this new method is even titled **ANALYSIS OF EXISTING METHOD**. Therefore, I don\u2019t consider this to be an innovation."

Experiments on well-known datasets indicate that the proposed method is on par with and sometimes superior to alternatives from the state of the art, including two diffusion-based methods. An ablation study complements the experiments, indicating that proper configuration of the proposed method is dataset dependent."

                "value": "* Sec.2.1 is very informal, and more importantly, uses precious space to outline methods that are not directly used in this work (only to review existing work in Sec. 2.2). Since score-based diffusion models through the lenses of stochastic differential equations are well known today, I suggest to make this part more compact, but at the same time more formal. Please, also double check grammar/typos (e.g., line 108: $f$ is an affine and $w$, \u2026) and mathematical notation (check the commas at the end of the equations, e.g. line 108, line 141). Concerning the informal tone: see the comment below $L_{SM}$, the score term there is just not analytically available, therefore Song et al. condition the score on the initial sample, such that it becomes accessible, resulting in $L_{DSM}$. It is not a matter of computational effort or the need for statistical methods.\n\n* Sec. 2.2: pay attention to notation overload: $T$ is used both to indicate diffusion time as well as forecast horizon. Check expression clarity: for example, lines 155,157 do not read well and are vague.\nIn my opinion, eq.1 and eq.2 are not clear. For eq.1, the input to the score network is $x^{\\text{hist}}$, as well as the nosy $x^{\\text{pred}}$. Does it mean that $x^{\\text{hist}}$ is not used as a conditioning signal, which would be a natural choice? For eq. 2, the input is $x^{\\text{hist}}$ and $x^{\\text{total}}$: since $x^{\\text{hist}} \\in x^{\\text{total}}$, couldn\u2019t we see this as an \u201cinpainting\" approach?\nSince the goal of this section, also according to what claimed in the introduction, is to review and categorize in two classes existing approaches, I think it would be useful to provide the reader with more insights than just the two loss functions.\n\n* Sec. 3: this part contains, to the best of my knowledge, several mathematical mistakes. The first expressions in Sec. 3.1 do not make sense to me, especially regarding the score term which is manipulated without care, and with arbitrary choice of variables that are not compatible with score-based diffusion formalism. What does it mean to take the gradient with respect to $x^{\\text{pred}}$ of the log of the conditional density of $x^{\\text{pred}}_t$ given $x^{\\text{hist}}$? Are you trying to make the correspondence between $x^{\\text{hist}}$ and $x_0$ (that is the clean data) and $x^{\\text{pred}}_t$ to a noisy version of the clean data $x_t$? Note the problem: $x_t$ can be obtained in closed form from $x_0$, whereas obtaining $x^{\\text{pred}}_t$ from $x^{\\text{hist}}$ is exactly the problem you are trying to solve.\nSimilarly, eq. 3 and eq. 4 are shaky. In Eq. 3, how do you compute the gradient of the score (this time properly defined) with respect to $x^{\\text{pred}}$, which you do not have access to? In Eq. 4, isn\u2019t it redundant to provide $x^{\\text{hist}}$ as an input to the score network $s(\\cdot)$, as it is already contained in $x^{\\text{total}}$?\nAlso, in line 212 it is said that weights are ignored for computational convenience. However, the weight $\\lambda$ is very important, as it determines what exactly you are optimizing: for example by setting $\\lambda(t)=g(t)^2/2$, minimizing the loss corresponds to maximum likelihood training [1, Sec. 2].\nFinally, it is necessary to delve into the details of the masking mechanism discussed in lines 251-252. It is used to discern past from future elements, which zeros out the future. This, in my opinion, is equivalent to the setup I alluded to in Sec.2 comments: essentially you can imagine $x^{\\text{total}}$ as an image, of which you zero out a region, leaving you with a portion that corresponds to $x^{\\text{hist}}$, which is amenable to an \u201cinpainting\u201d interpretation.\n\nNext, in sec 3.2.1 authors speak about generalizations of existing schemes to make the point that their approach is different from DiffWave. This is too strong of a claim, in my opinion.\n\nFinally, in sec 3.2.2 the authors could have discussed in more detail why the proposed method performs (slightly) better than diffusion-based alternatives such as TimeGrad and CSDI. For example, the initial message about classifying existing methods in two categories, and the intended take home message as to modeling $x^{\\text{total}}$ would have been stronger if properly compared and discussed.\n\n[1] Vahdat, Arash and Kreis, Karsten and Kautz, Jan, \u201cScore-based Generative Modeling in Latent Space\u201d, NeurIPS 2021.\n\n* Sec. 4: apart from traditional guidance, in Sec. 4.2 observation self-guidance is discussed (often attributing ideas to work from Song and Ho, which to the best of my knowledge do not refer to time-series data). The expression at line 380, which authors say implement Bayes rule, is ill defined: $p(a|b) \\sim p(b|a) p(a|b)$? The authors should double check, and consequently double check expression at line 383.\n\nOverall, I think the authors should do a better job at explaining the conditioning signal used for their guided method. Only the variant presented in the equation at line 397 is well defined. As a side note, it would have helped quite a lot numbering the various equations used throughout this paper."

            "questions": {
                "value": "* The claim for the superiority of generating $x^{\\text{total}}$ should be better supported. As hinted in the notes above (see weaknesses), a better description (in Appendix C) of the two alternative diffusion-based methods is in order, such as to clarify by means of your experiments what is exactly the pain point of auto-regressive generation. The results in Table 1 are not sufficient in my opinion, as there is not enough detail (apart from just indicating a different loss) to discern exactly what is going on. Results in Table 2 for competitor diffusion-based approaches are better than the numbers reported in Table 1, so I would like to understand if these are \u201ctoy models\u201d applied to real data to make the point, or if these correspond to full-fledged models from the literature that use different modeling approaches.\n* I think a big pass on the mathematical rigor of this work is in order. Can you please double check your expressions and derivations? This includes the proof provided in Appendix A, which to me appears as a sequence of manipulations that do not stand an appropriate derivation of the loss as most of the related work cited by the authors do.\n* Can you clarify the role of a guidance mechanism? Unfortunately, the presented experiments in Table 3 give the impression that guidance is only marginally beneficial, and it is hard to find a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d configuration."
