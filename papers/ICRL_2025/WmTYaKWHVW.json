    "title": "Learning to localize leakage of cryptographic keys through power consumption",
    "abstract": "While cryptographic algorithms such as the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are secure, *physical implementations* of these algorithms in hardware inevitably 'leak' sensitive information such as cryptographic keys. A particularly insidious form of leakage arises from the fact that hardware's power consumption over time is statistically associated with the data it processes and the instructions it executes. Supervised deep learning has emerged as a state-of-the-art tool for carrying out *power side-channel attacks*, which exploit this leakage to break cryptographic implementations by learning to map power consumption measurements recorded during encryption to the secret key used for that encryption. In this work, we seek instead to develop a principled deep learning framework for *defense* against such attacks by understanding the relative leakage due to power measurements recorded at different points in time. This information is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding *why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate the leakage (e.g. by indicating that a particular section of code or electronic component is responsible for leakage and should be revised). Towards this end, we propose a novel deep learning algorithm by formulating an adversarial game played between a classifier trained to estimate the conditional distribution of a key given power measurements, and an 'obfuscator' which probabilistically erases individual power measurements and is trained to minimize the classifier-estimated log-likelihood of the correct key, subject to a penalty on erasure probability. We theoretically characterize the ideal output of our algorithm in terms of conditional mutual information quantities involving the key and individual power measurements. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on real and synthetic datasets of power measurements from implementations of the AES cryptographic standard. Our code can be found (redacted).",

This approach uses a classifier-obfuscator framework: the classifier attempts to predict sensitive intermediate variables from power traces, while the obfuscator selectively erases sections of the trace to hinder the classifier\u2019s accuracy. By theoretically and experimentally pinpointing the time points that leak the most information, this method enables designers to focus security improvements on these critical areas."

Demonstrating the potential of this defense for other encryption schemes or algorithmic leakages could further enhance the paper\u2019s contribution.\nOne AES demonstration cannot prove the authors' claim that \u201cOur algorithm is generic enough to be applicable to other cryptographic standards as well.\u201d\n\nPower traces differ across hardware platforms, raising questions about the model\u2019s transferability. A model trained on one device may not perform effectively on another due to variations in leakage characteristics.\nDoes this imply that for each device, we would need to rebuild the model and collect a large number of traces to create a new dataset?\n\nAdditionally, the authors suggest that this method can help designers identify leakage points; however, what is more crucial is how to eliminate the leakage.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Threat Model: What is the threat model assumed in this work? In hardware security research, particularly in side-channel attacks targeting AES key extraction, attackers are typically assumed to have strong capabilities, often operating in a white-box setup. This implies they can partition the victim\u2019s software program and establish checkpoints for periodic power trace collection. Does this paper assume a similar setup?\n\nApplicability Across Devices: Assuming a white-box setup, a natural follow-up question is: how transferable are the collected traces to other devices? In power side-channel attacks, traces collected from one specific device often cannot be directly applied to another due to inter-device variations, as discussed in prior work [1]. If an attacker has access to only one device, they must generally recollect traces for each new target device, unless they have complete device-specific knowledge (see Point 1 above). This raises an important question for the proposed defensive solution: is it universally effective across different device setups, or does it require extensive adaptation?\n\nHardware Platform Variability: AES is widely deployed across a range of hardware platforms, including MCU, FPGA, GPU, and CPU, each with unique programming and operational characteristics. Given the objective of securing the most vulnerable or leaky portions of code, it would be helpful to discuss whether the proposed solution can generalize across these varied hardware platforms. How feasible is it for this approach to offer a uniform level of security given these differences?\n\nComparison with Existing Baselines: This paper would benefit from a comparative analysis with existing baseline methods. Numerous techniques exist from hardware, algorithmic, and cryptographic perspectives to mitigate AES key leakage in side-channel attacks. A comparison would help establish the proposed method\u2019s effectiveness and distinguish it from alternative solutions.\n\nReference:\n[1] Omar Choudary and Markus G. Kuhn. 2014.

Firstly, the technique requires tuning the hyperparameter \\lambda which can be challenging and may not always yield optimal results without proper calibration. \n2. Furthermore, the Points of Interest (PoIs) selected by the mask may not directly contribute to key recovery, requiring additional investigation. Specifically, it remains to be verified whether applying the mask effectively reduces the guessing entropy to zero when used in conjunction with a deep neural network. If not, the mask may provide misleading insights.\n3. Furthermore, it is not the first time occlusion has been used in profiling side-channel analysis. Two very important works are not cited: [1] and [2]. Notably, the current work bears significant similarities to [1], making a comparative analysis essential to contextualize the contributions.\n4. Additionally, the limited dataset selection raises concerns. Specifically, DPAv4 has known flaws in its masking schemes [3], rendering it a suboptimal choice. To enhance the robustness of the results, testing on ASCADv1 (random key setting) and other datasets like AES_HD or DPAv4.2 is recommended.\n\n5. The paper would benefit from prominently featuring the C2.1 metric in the main text. Additionally, a clear definition of the C2.1 metric is necessary to facilitate understanding.\n6.
