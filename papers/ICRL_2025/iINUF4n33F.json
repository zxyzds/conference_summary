    "title": "Text-Based Person Search in Full Images via Semantic Context Disentangling and Prototype Learning",
    "abstract": "Text-based Person Search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian within uncropped images based on natural language descriptions. Existing TBPS methods typically rely on candidate region generation and cross-modal matching. However, in complex scenes,especially those with multiple pedestrians in the image.It is often challenging to distinguish the target pedestrian from the background or other individuals. This leads to limited generalization capabilities.\n To address these issues, we propose a new TBPS framework named ProtoDis-TBPS, which integrates three key components: Semantic Context Decoupling (SCD), Prototype Embedding Learning (PEL), and a Cross-modal Person Re-identification (ReID) module. Specifically, SCD enhances cross-modal feature discrimination by separating background and irrelevant contextual information. PEL improves the model's robustness in complex scenes by learning prototype features for pedestrian categories. Finally, the ReID module, based on a Transformer architecture, further boosts the accuracy of both text-based pedestrian detection and re-identification in full images.Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method presents a significant challenge to existing approaches in this field.",
