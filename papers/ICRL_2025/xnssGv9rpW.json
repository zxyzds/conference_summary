    "title": "SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Generating novel crystalline materials has potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database.  To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal  which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.",

                "value": "\u2022\tIntroduction: From my perspective, the problem of generating symmetric crystals is closely related to other structure generation tasks in general representation learning. For instance, in biological applications, such as neuron structure generation or vascular structure generation, it would be beneficial if the authors discussed the relation to other domains in structure generation and the types of methods that have been developed. For example, I see certain similarities to diffusion methods in molecule generation [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10419041] or graph generation [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14734], which are partly mentioned in the methods since they are used; however, a discussion of how these applications relate to the context of representation learning would be valuable.\n\n\u2022\tReproducibility: I did not find a link to an anonymous repository or source code in OpenReview, hindering the evaluation of reproducibility for this submission.\n\n\n\u2022\tExperimentation: There are only minor performance gains (if any) compared to the state of the art. What are the practical uses of crystal symmetry generation in academia or industry? Is the computational gain truly relevant, considering the regular applications and scenarios in which crystal symmetry generation methods are used?\n\n\u2022\tExperimentation: \"We withhold 20% of the dataset as a validation set, and 20% as a test set\" (Line 377). The experimental setup suggests that the authors do not use a form of cross-validation or cross-testing. Is there a specific reason for this choice? Given that the authors describe their computational efficiency as a strength, extensive cross-validation across experiments would seem reasonable.\n\n\u2022\tExperimentation: Hyperparameter Selection (Section E.2). The authors briefly describe their final hyperparameters: \u201cThese hyperparameters were chosen using a sweep\u201d (Line 919). Without code availability and the validation issues mentioned earlier, this appears to be a limited experimental description. What was the hyperparameter search space/budget? How were the hyperparameters for the four baselines tuned exactly? The results show very small differences in performance, so a fair description of hyperparameter search is crucial for reproducibility.\n\n\nI am not an expert in crystal generation and potentially some of my questions are atypical in the field, I am curious to hear the authors and other reviewer comments and willing to change my rating accordingly."

Please mention in the conclusion remarks that your method of structural representation seems to be well-suited for molecular crystals as well. For the latter, the presence of intrinsic point symmetry and its interaction with the point symmetry of orbitals is one of the key factors determining the crystal structure.\n\n3. In your conclusions, when you state \"go beyond single crystals, and consider generating multi-component crystals and alloys,\" please clarify what you mean. \"Single crystal\" is a broad term contrasting with polycrystalline materials and does not directly relate to crystalline structure. A multi-component crystal refers to a crystal composed of multiple chemical substances; for instance, this includes pharmaceutical co-crystals. Clearly, your approach should be applicable to these systems.\n\n4. Please consider rewriting conclusions to emphasize advantages (applicability to molecular crystals, including co-crystals) rather than deficiencies (inapplicability to non-crystalline systems), but also, to provide a deeper discussion of the limitations of SymmCD along with practical implications for the actual industrial problems."

I understand an argument could be made that comparing the 10 SGs version to the other methods might not be entirely appropriate, but then I would consider dropping this version from tables 1 and 2, and only discuss it in the context of table 3, where the S.U.N. shines. Please clarify the logic behind inclusion of SymmCD (10 SGs) for Table 1 and Table 2.\n2. The evaluation presented in Table 3 involves random subsampling of 10% of the generated crystals, followed by two predictive models to evaluate stability and S.U.N. properties. At the same time, the SymmCD shows only a marginal improvement compared to DiffCSP and DiffCSP++. Are these results statistically significant? Please provide details on the robustness of this evaluation.\n3. Which model appears in the Table 4 as Conventional Unit Cell?
