    "title": "On Representing Convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs via Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we are the first to investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.",

                "value": "1. The two counterexamples given in this paper involves only linear constraints, which makes the conclusion less interesting. I understand that linear-constrained QP is a special case of QCQP and \"GNN fails on LCQP\" implies \"GNN fails on QCQP\", but I think a \"real\" QCQP would be the first interest of the potential readers of this paper, as \"quadratic constraint\" is the major claim in the title and abstract.\n\n2. The paper feels somewhat incomplete. While it highlights the limitations of GNNs on nonconvex QCQPs, it does not propose any potential solutions. The current takeaway seems to be \u201cGNNs are not suitable for nonconvex QCQPs,\u201d which might not be the intended message. Including suggestions or alternative approaches could improve the paper. As nonconvex problems are often studied on a case-by-case basis, identifying a specific nonconvex QCQP scenario where GNNs might still be effective would strengthen the contribution.\n\n3. The numerical experiments are not strong enough. The datasets are generated by perturbing a single instance, offering minimal insights into expressive power and generalization. If the GNN can only handle a single instance (with minor perturbations), it may not truly validate expressive power. Similarly, if the GNN only generalizes to problems perturbed from the sole instance in the training set, it weakly supports generalization."
