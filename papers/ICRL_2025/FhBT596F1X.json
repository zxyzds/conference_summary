    "title": "Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals",
    "abstract": "The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Global Graph Exchange Correlation (GG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks. GG-XC combines semi-local functionals with a non-local feature density parametrized by an equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud representation of the electron density to capture long-range interactions.  By differentiating through a self-consistent field solver, we train GG-XC requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find GG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, GG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, GG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, GG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.",

The use of CCSD(T) energies as a baseline adds to the robustness of the study.\n\n- Clarity: The structural breakdown of GG-XC into nuclei-centered embeddings, equivariant message passing, non-local reweighting, and graph readout is well-organized. However, clearer explanations regarding specific design choices, such as graph readout and the integration of the SCF process, would strengthen accessibility for readers outside the immediate field.\n\n- Significance: By bridging ML force fields and DFT, GG-XC has potential implications for more accurate and scalable quantum mechanical computations. The work promises improvements in data efficiency and applicability to larger molecules, essential for fields like materials science and drug discovery."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Ambiguity in Methodological Details: Key details around the learning objectives and loss functions are unclear. For instance, it is inferred that GG-XC utilizes CCSD(T)-derived energy and density for training, but an explicit statement on this is missing. Additionally, the training schemes \u02d9such as backpropagating through functional derivatives) need to be explicitly written. Please clarify the optimization procedure and loss function explicitly.\n\n- Design Choices in Non-Local Reweighting: The inclusion of the graph readout term and the reasoning behind the design choice to learn meta-GGA coefficients in GG-XC lacks sufficient justification. The authors suggest that the graph readout captures remaining non-local effects but do not clearly explain why the non-local terms in the preceding convolution is insufficient. \n\n- Insufficient SCF Explanation: The SCF procedure, particularly the calculation of the exchange-correlation functional's differential form with respect to density, is inadequately detailed. Especially, the calculation of Fock operator is absent in the manuscript. A deeper explanation of the differentiation through the graph readout term, specifically how it integrates into the SCF iterations, is necessary.\n\n- Computational Cost and Efficiency: The paper omits a thorough computational cost analysis. An assessment of GG-XC\u2019s runtime compared to standard mGGA or hybrid methods would clarify the efficiency benefits. Additional experiments comparing GG-XC with conventional mGGA and hybrid methods regarding speed and computational bottlenecks would significantly improve the work. This reviewer's recommendation are the mGGA functional $\\epsilon_{\\text{mGGA}}$ used in the GG-XC and $\\omega B97X$ functional as in the 3BPA dataset.\n\n- Comparative Baselines: While delta-machine learning methods are included in the comparison, the paper contrasts GG-XC trained on higher-level mGGA data with models trained on lower-level LDA for delta learning. This might obscure performance differences, as delta-learning methods trained on comparable baseline data (mGGA) could offer a more direct comparison. As mentioned in the previous point, please use the mGGA functional for the baseline models."

If CCSD(T) energy and density are indeed the targets, please confirm this assumption and clarify how functional derivatives are computed efficiently.\n\n- Non-Local Reweighting Design Choice: What justifies the inclusion of the graph readout term when non-local terms are already introduced in the integral preceding it? Is there evidence that including the readout term substantively enhances performance?\n\n- Differentiation Through SCF: Could the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the SCF process, particularly the derivation of the exchange-correlation functional\u2019s differential form with respect to density? Furthermore, how is differentiation handled in the context of the graph readout term?\n\n- Computational Efficiency Analysis: What is GG-XC\u2019s relative computational cost compared to traditional mGGA and hybrid methods? An analysis of bottlenecks, particularly in terms of graph processing and SCF convergence, would be helpful for readers."

In comparison, the force field paper prioritizes force accuracy, critical for molecular dynamics simulations, while the learned XC functional paper focuses on density accuracy, which is essential for practical DFT applications. However, the authors of the equivariant model rely only on energy metrics for evaluation, potentially leading to an incomplete comparison between the works. Despite the accessibility of force calculations via differential techniques, the equivariant model omits these, which are crucial for molecular dynamics. Additionally, density, a foundational component in DFT that governs electron distribution and influences properties such as dipole moments and band gaps, is not evaluated in the equivariant model.\n2. The lack of tests on intermolecular non-covalent interactions and chemical reactions is a considerable gap. The differentiable programming approach demonstrates generalizability by successfully benchmarking against intermolecular non-covalent interaction datasets and different chemical reactions. Expanding the equivariant model's validation to include these would indicate broader reliability.\n3. The lack of explicit enforcement of physical constraints may limit the accuracy in certain edge cases.\n4. The model\u2019s reliance on nuclei-based embeddings may make it less suitable for non-atomic systems."
