    "title": "PATTERN MATCHING-BASED OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DETECTION FOR MULTI-LABEL NODE CLASSIFICATION",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved dominant performance in various prediction tasks on graphs. When deploying GNNs in the real world, estimating the possibility of out-of-distribution (OOD) testing samples becomes a crucial safety concern. Although some research has investigated the graph OOD detection problem, most have concentrated on single-label classification scenarios, aspecific case of the more general multi-label classification, which has broader applications, such as in social networks where nodes can represent users with multiple interests or attributes. In this paper, we first introduce and define the multi-label graph OOD detection problem and propose a simple yet effective pattern matching-based OOD detection method to address it. In particular, our method utilizes feature pattern matching and label pattern matching to obtain two matching scores. By incorporating topological structure adjustment, we ultimately derive confidence scores, serving as indicators of the likelihood that a test sample is an OOD instances. We conduct extensive comparisons with existing OOD detection methods in the context of multi-label graphs. The results show that our method achieves an impressive 7.61% reduction in FPR95 compared to the leading baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our approach can servas a benchmark for OOD detection on multi-label graphs.",

It defines the problem, and proposes a method to quantify feature pattern matching and label pattern matching, utilizing label propagation to derive the final confidence score for OOD. Empirical evaluations on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better average accuracy compared to selected baselines."

                "value": "Weaknesses:\n1. The paper lacks details on the normalization of two scores in Equation 11.  Additionally, the equal weighting of these scores seems arbitrary and might need further investigation into alternative weighting schemes or a data-driven approach to determine optimal weights.\n\n2. Figure 3 in the paper lacks explicit details about its origin. It is unclear whether the figure is based on specific data analysis or merely serves as a random illustration. This lack of clarity is particularly crucial because the figure is used to explain the design choice of \"sum logits\" in the absence of theoretical analysis.\n\n3. Though the experimental results show the proposed method achieves a better score on average, it is suggested to provide further analysis to explain why it performs worse in certain domains within the DBLP dataset. In addition, the paper lacks a theoretical foundation to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n4. The major concern is the limited novelty of the proposed method. Feature pattern matching and label pattern matching have been widely adopted in previous works like NAC and (Hendrycks et al., 2022). And label propagation is also common in handling graph data to refine pseudo labels or predicted scores. The proposed method appears to be a direct combination of existing methods in multi-label classification OOD and graph mining, with limited novel contributions."

I wonder about the unique challenges of graph domains and how the authors solve them with their creative contributions. \n\nW3: It seems that this paper is not the first work to solve multi-label graph OOD detection. See this work: Evidence-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection on Multi-Label Graphs. \n\nW4: I think the paper could be further polished. The language writing could be significantly improved. \n\nW5: It would be more solid if the proposed solutions could have some theoretical guarantee.\n\n\nOverall, this manuscript may propose a self-contained solution to multi-label OOD problems on graph domains. Although I hate to say this, I am afraid I have to say (with full respect) that the novelty and contributions of this submission might be not strong enough for this conference. I think it might be further enhanced with some theoretical support, more convincing public code, and more clear paper writing \n\nPlus: Kindly note that when I say \"more clear writing\", I do not only hope the language issues could be improved (e.g. line 075-077) but I also think there are some logical points in the paper should be polished. For example, the authors use a large part of the content to say they use sigmoid instead of softmax for multi-label problems. Do the authors wish to treat this as their contribution? because I think it is such a simple and obvious thing. If the authors wish to claim this tiny change matters and is a significant technique contribution, maybe they can provide with in-depth theory analysis further. Many other places are looked like just for filling the page length but I don't know why they are necessary to be mentioned. The authors present some technique choices and different results (like Figure 3) but we need to know why."
