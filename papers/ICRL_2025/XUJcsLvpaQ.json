    "title": "G-Transformer for Conditional Average Potential Outcome Estimation over Time",
    "abstract": "Estimating potential outcomes for treatments over time based on observational data is important for personalized decision-making in medicine. Yet, existing neural methods for this task either (1) do not perform proper adjustments for time-varying confounders, or (2) suffer from large estimation variance. In order to address both limitations, we introduce the G-transformer (GT). Our GT is a novel, neural end-to-end model which adjusts for time-varying confounders, and provides low-variance estimation of conditional average potential outcomes (CAPOs) over time. Specifically, our GT is the first neural model to perform regression-based iterative G-computation for CAPOs in the time-varying setting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our GT across various experiments. In sum, this work represents a significant step towards personalized decision-making from electronic health records.",

The primary contribution is exploring the transformer backbone in treatment effect estimation, which has been widely investigated in existing work (static setting [1] and dynamic setting [2]).\n  * From the application perspective, the paper claims that their model can help personalize decision-making from patient trajectories in medicine. However, it lacks discussion on how the model's estimates would concretely translate to real-world decision support. Furthermore, the assumptions on which the model relies (e.g., positivity, ignorability) are restrictive and may not hold robustly in practical, real-world scenarios.\n\n- While the paper claims to reduce estimation variance, it lacks a theoretical analysis of variance bounds. Given GT\u2019s objective to minimize estimation variance, a more rigorous theoretical justification or a derivation of variance bounds would significantly strengthen this claim.\n\n-  The paper does not consider the existence of unobserved (and potentially time-varying) confounders, which can introduce biases and affect CAPO estimation in real-world EHR settings.\n\n- The study uses a semi-synthetic dataset derived from MIMIC-III. It would be valuable to see the model's performance on fully real-world datasets to assess its utility in practical clinical decision-making problems.\n\n[1] Zhang, Yi-Fan, et al. \"Exploring transformer backbones for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.01336 (2022).\n\n[2] Melnychuk, Valentyn, Dennis Frauen, and Stefan Feuerriegel. \"Causal transformer for estimating counterfactual outcomes.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

The combination of transformer and temporal-difference learning (i.e. pseudo-outcome regression as called by the authors) are already proposed in [1] for the estimation of CAPO (on top of that, [1] also went one step further and proposed the adjustment for marginal causal parameters). Besides, the heterogeneous token transformer architecture in [1] appears to be a more clean and intuitive solution as opposed to the proposed architecture in my judgement. The proposed transformer architecture is rather trivial and does not significantly differ from [2]. At the very least, the author should compare their architeture to [1], show experimental results and properly state their contributions compared to prior work.\n\n2. The paper has a very weak description of prior work related to pseudo-outcome regression in my opinion. Not only is the exact same procedure temporal-difference learning proposed before as stated above, it is widely used in causal inference and reinforcement learning known as sequential regression [3] and Q-learning [4]. The omission of these works by the authors made it look like pseudo-outcome regression is a novel contribution of their own.\n\n[1] Shirakawa, Toru, et al. \"Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation with Temporal-Difference Heterogeneous Transformer.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

I encourage the author(s) to discuss these works and highlight key differences with their proposed approach.\n\n- The paper asserts that related works, such as G-Net, which properly adjust for time-varying confounding, result in high estimation variance without providing substantial experimental or theoretical results to support this claim. Only RMSE values with error bars are provided (Tables 2 and 3), which seems insufficient given that this is a central claim of the GT approach.\n\n- The experimental results seem underwhelming. Only one semi-synthetic dataset is considered, and RMSE is provided to quantify performance. I encourage the author(s) to explore evaluations tied to meaningful clinical measures, including precision in the estimation of heterogeneous effects, average treatment effects, and qualitative analysis measures of over- or underestimation of outcomes.\n\n- Clarity: The notation and writing need improvement for clarity and readability. The use of both $U$ and $H$ to denote the random variables $\\{Y_t, X_t, A_t\\}$ does not seem necessary. The paper seems to refer to $H$ throughout, and it's unclear why $U$ was introduced. The definitions for $\\bar{Y}$, $\\bar{X}$, and $\\bar{A}$ are not provided. The recursion could be made more explicit by combining Equations (8) and (9) and providing a simple example, e.g., $\\tau = 3$. The paper's use of $\\delta$, $\\tau$, and $t$ for indexing time needs further simplification. Additionally, the definition for $\\tau$ should be provided in the *Setup* section.\n\n\n**References**\n- [1] Andersen et al.
