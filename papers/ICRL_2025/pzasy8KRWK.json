    "title": "Physically Aligned Hierarchical Mesh-based Network for Dynamic System Simulation",
    "abstract": "Dynamic systems evolve through complex interactions, where local events influence global behaviors, reflecting the interconnected nature of real-world phenomena. Simulating such systems demands models that effectively capture both local and long-range dynamics, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. However, existing mesh-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods often struggle to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets, complex mesh structures, and extensive long-range effects. Inspired by how real-world dynamic systems operate, we present the Mesh-based Multi-Segment Graph Network (MMSGN), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by leveraging a physically aligned hierarchical information exchange mechanism. MMSGN combines micro-level local interactions with macro-level global exchanges, aligning the hierarchical mesh structure with the system\u2019s physical properties to seamlessly capture both local and global dynamics. This approach enables precise modeling of complex behaviors while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our model on multiple dynamic system datasets and compare it with several state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that MMSGN delivers superior accuracy and mesh quality, excels in managing long-range effects, and maintains high computational efficiency. Furthermore, MMSGN exhibits strong generalization capabilities, scaling effectively to larger physical domains. These advantages make MMSGN well-suited for simulating complex, large-scale dynamic systems across a variety of scenarios. Codes and data will be made publicly accessible upon acceptance.",

                "value": "1. **Clarity of High-Level Concept**: The core idea\u2014that deformations primarily remain local to the area of contact and propagate slowly across the entire structure so some clustered feature would be helpful\u2014is intuitive and easy to follow. This perspective makes sense in scenarios where local interactions don\u2019t significantly affect distant areas. I found the paper easy to follow. In addition, I think the paper provides good details on the setup of the experiments (including baselines).\n\n2. **Physics-guided Segmentation**: I like the idea of using segmentation/clustering to \"reduce feature space\" locally, it draws some interesting connections to modern CNN and ViT structure in CV, and reduced-order modelling in engineering. In addition, Positional Encoding (PE) and Segment Encoding (SE) definitions are grounded in physical intuition by constructions.\n\n3. **Performance**: Surprisingly fast compared to well-established baselines like MGN. However, I would like to learn some intuition behind this -- based on the neural network structure, I can't really tell where the performance boost comes from. Is it because the number of message-passing steps between nodes was reduced?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Questionable Motivation in Localization**: The emphasis on local deformation may not always hold, especially in fields like computational physics or mechanical engineering, where elasticity often results in global, fast propagating deformation\u2014particularly with low-stiffness materials. This raises concerns that the paper's foundation may not fully align with real-world mechanics.\n\n2. **Limitations in Segmentation Approach**: The paper\u2019s reliance on *purely geometric* (and arguably *topological*) clustering for segmentation may not capture clusters that reflect true mechanical behavior. For instance, with a bird flapping its wings, both wings would oscillate at similar frequencies, we could naturally group them as a single cluster in modal analysis. However, the geometric-only approach used here might yield clusters highly dependent on the initial setup, potentially missing important physical interdependencies. A physics-inspired method, like modal analysis, could provide clusters with greater physical relevance and reduce sensitivity to initialization. This is my major concern with this submission, the current segmentation approach is too *geometric* and already exhibits a **strong** prior on how every deformation must be highly local.\n\n3. **Mesh Resolution Sensitivity and Segment Size Issues**: As number of segments grows, the number of finite elements within them decreases, leading to potential accuracy and performance downgrades. Appendix Table 4 reflects this, with errors increasing as segment size grows in some examples, but the paper lacks clarity on how it determines an optimal cluster count."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. **Mesh Continuity**: While the authors use *Mesh Continuity* as the mesh quality benchmark, this metric may not be standard in all visual computing applications or mechanical engineering without proper citations. I would recommend using aspect ratio, or \"as-regular-as-possible\" metric to measure the uniformness for every element (triangle/tetrahedra) on the mesh, as it is a more common mesh quality metric in FEM literature. Furthermore, the sole use of Hausdorff distance for geometric fidelity could be limiting; adding Chamfer distance would provide a more balanced measure of mesh accuracy.\n2. **Underwhelming PE Impact**: Despite the geometric reasoning behind PE(e.g. understanding relative location between within segments), the benefit is marginal (around a 10% reduction in RMSE on the already low error). Could the authors elaborate on the observed impact of PE?\n3. **Selection of Optimal Number of Clusters**: The paper includes an empirical analysis in Appendix Table 4, showing that the number of clusters impacts accuracy (with only two data points along the # of clusters dimension shown in the table). Given the algorithm's similarity to K-means, selecting an optimal number of clusters and their initialization will likely be crucial for accuracy and convergence speed. Could the authors expand on their criteria for selecting the optimal number of clusters, and explain how initialization sensitivity is managed in the clustering process?\n\n\n**Misc**:\n- **Missing Error Metrics**: Figure 3 lacks error colormap ranges, making it difficult to assess error variability.\n- **Physics-Inspired Segmentation**: Consider exploring modal analysis in engineering and fracture modes in graphics for relevant physics-driven segmentation methods."

                "value": "**Major**\nMy main concerns are the contributions of the paper with regards to EAGLE and the clarity of these contributions in the paper. The approach is extremely close to the EAGLE model, and while results are indeed better, the better barely explain why, and I struggle to extract general knowledge that would be transferable to future research. To be precise:\n- The fact that Multi-level is highly beneficial in models for simulating physics on meshes is well known from previous results (Liu et al, 2021, Janny et al 2023, Cao et al, 2023).\n- The \"micro-level\" structure is a straightforward MGN model, exactly like in EAGLE.\n- The \"macro-level\" structure is an attention over a fully connected mesh on the downscaled graph, exactly like in EAGLE. \n- The merge of micro and macro level information is done by concatenating both representations, like in EAGLE.\n\nEventually, I noted the following differences with Janny et al. 2023 :\n- The clustering algorithm is improved. To me, this is the main contribution of the paper, I will come back to this.\n- The position encodings seem improved, but Table 5 indicates that it does not have impact on the performances.\n- Cluster representations are aggregated via average pooling, while EAGLE was using a GRU. This seems like a minor modification, and it is not discussed in the paper.\n- Finally, the projection of the concatenated representation to the physical space is done with an MLP instead of another layer of GNN. Again, this difference is minor and not discussed in the paper.\n\nHence the only key contribution is the new clustering algorithm which uses physical prior to downscale the mesh while EAGLE was using a simple position-based clustering. This a valid and interesting way of improving this kind of model. Yet, the paper limits itself to describe when it works on three datasets, and fail (in my opinion) to extract rules, knowledge, insights that would advances the field of research.\n- Algorithm 1 seems to be a straightforward K-means algorithm with handcrafted features modeling some aspect of the physical property of the domain.\n- The authors tested different features, some of them working on some datasets, some did not without explanations. I could not find any insights on this phenomenon that would explain why and how the contribution actually benefits the learning of the dynamics.\n- While the authors claims that the model works because the clustering \"ensure that similar physical interactions are handled uniformly\", I see no evidence that these clusters make indeed more sense for training an DL based simulator, apart from empirical results on three datasets.\n\nLess importantly, I am not convinced that the community needs another medium-scale dataset of mesh-based physics simulations, and I struggle to see in what DeformingBeam differs from other existing tasks.\n\n**Minor** (little to no effect on my review)\n- The author used \"dynamic\" in several sentences to describe their clustering method. Yet, it is not based on \"dynamic\" (it is not taking time into account, which is what dynamics is about). I think the words \"physical\" and \"dynamic\" have been used interchangeably, but it is confusing for me (some sample lines where dynamics is used arguably misleadingly: line 78/79, line 183, line 216, ...)\n- The related work section could benefits from few words about existing datasets for physics on meshes, since DeformingBeam is one of the contributions. In general, while the related work section presents well the state-of-the-art, it could better situate your contribution in the existing literature.\n- l.220 \"outputs a set OF graph\" ?\n- l. 806 : \"we use the its shortest distance\"\n- l. 433 : \"simulation.(SPACE)More\"\n\n**Motivation for my grade**\nMy rating is based on the lack of significant contributions of the paper. Most of the architecture is based on EAGLE. The only noticeable novelty is the better clustering technique, but the paper only presents experimental results on some datasets and fails to extract general knowledge that would benefit the community. \nI strongly encourage the authors to (1) prove me wrong if the contribution extends beyond the clustering technique and (2) strengthen the paper with a better analysis of the results, including when and why the proposed model performs better."

It is not clear what are the conclusions of this experiment, since some methods work better on some datasets while some do not, and there is no clear reason why. Could you interpret these results ?\n- Did you have any evidence that the segmentation is indeed correlated with the dynamics of the system (and not solely its geometrical description) ? \n- Does patterns emerges from the cluster's dynamics that would explain why your method performs well ?\n- Did you spotted any behavior of your segmentation method that does not arise from EAGLE's purely geometric clusters that would explain or give an intuition about how the model benefits/uses these clusters ?\n- You mention in the introduction that previous work \"face drawbacks like manual effort or inaccurate mesh edges\". Can you please develop why your method does not suffer from the same issues ?\n- While your method is (I think) very close from EAGLE, why not evaluating on the corresponding dataset, which has been designed specifically for very similar models ? It has proven to be sensibly harder than CylinderFlow which exhibits a lot of regularities.\n- Where did you sampled the initial condition that you provided to the models ? Is it randomly sampled in a longer simulation or does it corresponds to the very first timestep ? If not, it would be interesting to compare the models in a realistic scenario where the simulation is done from a \"cold start\".\n- I am very confused by the description of the physics-guided segmentation (line 244 to 265). First, you mention that you apply METIS to obtain clusters, followed by SLIC to refine them (to be honest, I'm not familiar with these algorithms, I had to look them up), but it seems that you only used algorithm 1 (which seems to be a K-means with handcrafted features). Am I mistaken ? Is there a difference between your proposed approach and a K-means algorithm ? I think this could be made clearer in the paper.\n- Line 225 to 230, you introduce a notation for overlapping clusters. This is not used in the main paper, and the ablation shows that this has negative effect on two datasets and positive on the last one. Why so ? Can we generalize from this experiment to understand which property of the underlying physics could benefits from $\\delta>0$ ?"
