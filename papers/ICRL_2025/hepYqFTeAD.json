    "abstract": "Point cloud registration (PCR) has been an important research subject for many years but remains an open problem, presenting numerous challenges. The stability of existing registration methods is often inadequate, particularly in scenarios with low overlap. This issue primarily arises from the insufficient distinctiveness of extracted point cloud features, leading to ambiguous matches and the proliferation of outliers. To address these bottlenecks in point cloud registration, it is crucial to fully leverage the color information of the point clouds to discern point correspondences effectively.\nHowever, excessive control over color may disrupt the spatial structure of the point cloud, making it essential to find a balance between the aggressiveness and stability of color integration.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose UPC-PCR, which unlocks the potential of color information while maintaining stability. Specifically, we design a Curvature-Color Fusion Module (CCF) to initialize distinctive features. Additionally, to balance color aggressiveness, we enhance the geometric structure by introducing a Centroid Angular (CA) embedding for superpoint structure encoding, which is particularly effective in low-overlap scenes.\nWhile CCF and CA ensure the distinctiveness of point features, the aggressive use of color in the feature enhancement process may still introduce errors. Therefore, we develop a robust estimator equipped with Feature-based Compatibility Hypergraph Convolution (FCH) to learn higher-order compatibility of correspondences and effectively filter out outliers.\nEvaluation across multiple datasets has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of UPC-PCR, achieving registration recalls of 98.4%/90.4% on Color3DMatch/Color3DLoMatch.",

                "value": "1. This paper lacks novelty. For example, the proposed Curvature-Color Fusion Module is simply a fusion of color information and point cloud structural information, which is quite similar to existing approaches in the literature[1],[2],[3]. The Centroid Angular embedding, however, is confusing to me. Since it is one of the core modules, I believe the authors should clearly explain how it functions. As for Feature-based Compatibility Hypergraph Convolution, it is essentially the same as what is described in Hunter[4]. Therefore, I think that this paper is not sufficiently innovative enough to be accepted by ICLR.\n2. This work appears to be a systematic project that combines various existing works. Its contribution to advancing the community is incremental, more akin to small improvements or \"tricks\" rather than groundbreaking innovations.\n3. When the inlier ratio is significantly lower, it\u2019s puzzling that the registration recall rate can still be higher. The authors should provide an analysis to explain this.   \n\n[1] Zhang Y, Yu J, Huang X, et al.

                "value": "1. From a holistic viewpoint, the current study represents more of an incremental step compared to previous methods, notably relying heavily on GeoTransformer [1] and ColorPCR [2]. Consequently, I find the technical contributions somewhat constrained. For example, while the authors introduce curvature to the prior color feature [2], curvature has also been extensively utilized, as seen in [3]. The centroid angular embedding utilized in this study appears to be a mere incremental extension of pair-wise distance embedding and triplet-wise angular embedding, retaining a similar structural framework.\n\n2. On line 363 of Page 7, the author mentions, \"For IR, because of the aggressive introduction of color, which may disrupt the spatial structure of the point cloud.\" I am curious as to why color is perceived to disrupt geometric structures.\n\n3. In Table 2, why does the translation accuracy not match up to ColorPCR overall? Could this be attributed to the inclusion of color information?\n\n4. In Table 3, I recommend that the authors include all metrics instead of solely RR, as this could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the current method.\n\n5. Another concern I have is regarding benchmark testing. Given that the current registration recall and matching recall values are nearly 100%, have the authors tested real-world scanned point clouds, such as data captured from LiDAR or autonomous driving? This practical testing may hold more significance than mere quantitative enhancements.\n\n6. Typos:\n\n(1). Line 064 Page 2, \u201cUnleash the power\u201d->unleash\n\n(2).

I also suggest the authors add the comparison of FCH with ColorPCR in ablation studies.\n\nThe title is UNLEASH THE POWER OF COLOR FOR POINT CLOUD REGISTRATION, however, the only operation for color information is the concatenation with geometric information. In ablation studies, the authors also mentioned that FCH helps reject the errors caused by color. And the results of the proposed method do not totally overperform ColorPCR, which the authors described as \u2018imposes certain limitations on the utilization of color power\u2019.

I don't think the power of color is effectively explored by the authors.\n\nThe minor concerns are on the three modules introduced, CCF, CA and FCH. They are more or less incremental or not very significant. FCH seems a bit more creative than other two in my view, but it is basically a compatibility integrated graph convolution."

                "value": "1. The authors aim at exploring the color for better performances, but actually the proposed method only takes the color in the very first fusion step. In addition, the usage is also quite simple by fusion. I don't see they have fully explored the power of color. In other words, the power of the proposed method still relies on the 3D geometrical points.\n\n2. CA is said to tackle the small overlapping problem because it may change little for small overlaps. However, I don't understand how it can serve as positional guidance here. It is perhaps yet another information on the points. In addition, the ablation on CA seems confusing (Tab. 5). It may not so good as expected as IR shows. \n\n3. FCH is also a bit difficult to understand. Perhaps a figure introduction can solve all my coming confusions. It seems that the compatibilities are used to create the hypergraph for  further feature aggregation. However, what's the principle behind Eq. 3 and why can the correlations be measured by Eq. 5? I can only barely understand them.\n\n4. Overall, the proposed tactics, CCF, CA and FCH, are not very significant. I believe they can be useful for the color PCR  but they are not very significant but just incremental contributions. None of them is deeply explored for maximal performances. This feeling can also be observed from the results which are not very stable and consistent."
