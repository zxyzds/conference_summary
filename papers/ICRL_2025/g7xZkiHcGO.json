    "title": "Investigating Domain Gaps for Indoor 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a first benchmark with commonly used ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets, as well as our newly proposed large-scale SimRoom and SimHouse datasets by a 3D simulator with far greater number of objects and more precise annotations. Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within each dataset, such as point cloud quality, room layout configuration, style and object size. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation scenarios, analyzing the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We observe that through our evaluated domain gap factors, synthetic-to-real adaptation is the most difficult adaptation hurdle to overcome. We also introduce several domain adaptation approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing a first baseline for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains.",

Methods like the mean teacher framework and size priors are standard and do not demonstrate significant innovation or exploration of recent advancements in domain adaptation, using such basic adaptation methods might be insufficient to challenge future models.\nIn addition, although the paper claims that the synthetic datasets have high-quality annotations, there is a lack of discussion about how faithfully these datasets mimic real-world scenarios. More detailed analysis of data consistency and potential annotation noise could demonstrate the reliability and generalizability of the results.\nAlso, the paper could provide more information about the consistency and quality assurance processes used in annotating SimRoom and SimHouse. Since the study utilizes the SimRoom and SimHouse with our existing datasets, inconsistencies or errors in labeling between these datasets collected can lead to unreliable benchmarks and misleading conclusions. Further discussion demonstrating the consistency of the data collection and labeling processes for these datasets will be beneficial for establishing the benchmark."

For example, the unsupervised domain adaptation method for indoor 3D detection by Wang et al. ([1]) presents an alternative approach that could be discussed alongside the authors' findings. Highlighting the similarities, differences, and potential synergies between these methods would provide valuable context for readers.\nAdditionally, Lu et al.'s work ([2]), which focuses on open-vocabulary 3D object detection without the need for 3D annotations, offers useful benchmarks. The authors could reference Table 3 from that study, which examines transfer learning effectiveness in indoor 3D detection. Comparing their results with those of Lu et al. would clarify how their methods contribute to the state of the art and identify areas for further exploration.\n[1] Yunsong Wang.
