    "title": "MamKO: Mamba-based Koopman operator for modeling and predictive control",
    "abstract": "The Koopman theory, which enables the transformation of nonlinear systems into linear representations, is a powerful and efficient tool to model and control nonlinear systems. However, the ability of the Koopman operator to model complex systems, particularly time-varying systems, is limited by the fixed linear state-space representation. To address this limitation, the large language model, Mamba, is considered a promising strategy for enhancing modeling capabilities while preserving the linear state-space structure. In this paper, we propose a new framework, the Mamba-based Koopman operator (MamKO), which provides enhanced model predictability and adaptability, as compared to Koopman models with constant Koopman operators. Inspired by the Mamba structure, MamKO generates Koopman operators from online data; this enables the model to effectively capture the dynamic behaviors of the nonlinear system over time. A model predictive control system is then developed based on the proposed MamKO model. The modeling and control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments on benchmark time-invariant and time-varying systems. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Additionally, we perform ablation experiments to test the effectiveness of individual components of MamKO. This approach unlocks new possibilities for integrating large language models with control frameworks, and it achieves a good balance between advanced modeling capabilities and real-time control implementation efficiency.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose MamKo, combining Koopman operator theory (projecting nonlinear systems into a high-dimensional linear space) with Mamba (a LLM based on state-space models) for accurate and efficient modeling of time-varying systems. Furthermore, based on the derived model, a model-based control approach is proposed. Simulations with different, time-varying systems demonstrate that MamKo can be superior to other SOTA methods. \n\nThe main contribution is combining these two methods (with some minor modifications), creating a powerful framework for time-varying systems."

The modeling and control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments on benchmark time-invariant and time-varying systems.\nFour claims are made as advancing the state of the art\n1. Matrix generation using Mamba structure\n2. approach can handle unstable and time varying systems\n3. Computationally efficient MPC is developed based on the MamKO approach\n4. Experiments are provided in support. \nOverall, the paper is well written and the developments are clear and error free.  While the authors have not demonstrated the results against any real world practical system, they do provide adequate development for a practitioner to adopt into real world problems and study applicability.  In that regard I think this work is worth publishing so the SOTA in Kooman based approaches   can continue to be explored for real world use."

Leveraging Mamba for generating time-varying Koopman operators to address the limitations of fixed linear state-space models is innovative.\n2. The authors  effectively incorporate MamKO into an MPC framework and demonstrate practical applications.  ability to formulate the control problem as a convex optimization task adds to the framework's appeal for real-time applications.\n3. The experimental validation (although all simulations)  is based on multiple benchmark systems (e.g., CartPole, Gene Regulatory Networks, and CSTRs). Results demonstrate the advantages of MamKO over traditional methods like Deep Koopman Operator (DKO) and MLP-based models. \n4. Real-Time Adaptability: By generating matrices in real-time, MamKO addresses the challenge of modeling time-varying systems efficiently. The proposed method's performance on rapidly changing systems highlights its practical utility.\n5. Supplemental material allows reproducibility"

However, the paper could enhance its rigor by including statistical analyses (e.g., confidence intervals or hypothesis tests) to demonstrate the significance of the results.\n\nAuthors do acknowledge that their method may not generalize to all real-world systems, but a more explicit discussion on the boundaries of applicability (e.g., systems with extremely high-frequency dynamics) would add value.\n\nComparison: The benchmark methods used have all been solved using classical/modern control methods, yet eth author did not include any non data-driven solutions for comparison.  This may be a useful addition to the paper."

The RSCP problem has a scale of hours and is therefore generally very slow.  It will be good to see clearly the range of problems in time scale and frequency scale to understanding capability against system dynamics. \n\nTheoretical:  The paper could use more rigorous theoretical analysis or proofs to back the claims of stability and effectiveness in capturing time-varying dynamics. For example, formal proofs of the convergence properties of the Mamba-based Koopman operators or bounds on the error in approximating nonlinear systems would greatly increase the paper\u2019s credibility.\n\nEquation (5): The transition from a time-invariant to a time-varying state-space model is theoretically justified but lacks a rigorous mathematical proof. The paper relies heavily on empirical evidence, perhaps some theoretical discussion may be help support eth generalizability of the method.\n\nCELU Activation: The use of the negative CELU function is an interesting choice to handle instability. The mathematical justification provided for this choice seems reasonable, but more in-depth analysis of how it impacts model stability across different systems would strengthen the claim."
