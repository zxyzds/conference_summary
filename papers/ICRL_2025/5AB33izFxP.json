    "title": "Simultaneous Online System Identification and Control using Composite Adaptive Lyapunov-Based Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Although deep neural network (DNN)-based controllers are popularly used to control uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems, most results use DNNs that are pretrained offline and the corresponding controller is implemented post-training. Recent advancements in adaptive control have developed controllers with Lyapunov-based update laws (i.e., control and update laws derived from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis) for updating the DNN weights online to ensure the system states track a desired trajectory. However, the update laws are based on the tracking error, and offer guarantees on only the tracking error convergence, without providing any guarantees on system identification. This paper provides the first result on composite adaptive Lyapunov-based update law, involving a combination of the tracking error and a prediction error of the system dynamics, to adjust the weights of all layers of a DNN-based controller. As a result, the DNN can rapidly adapt to simultaneously achieve the goals of tracking a desired trajectory and identifying the system dynamics online. Since evaluating the DNN's prediction error typically requires state-derivative information, a dynamic state-derivative estimator is developed and interlaced with the weight update law. A combined Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided, which guarantees that the tracking error, state-derivative estimation error, and DNN weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Additionally, a persistence of excitation (PE) condition is developed for the DNN. When the PE condition is satisfied, significantly tighter bounds are obtained on the tracking and weight estimation errors, thus achieving system identification and enhanced trajectory tracking performance. As an outcome of the system identification, the DNN model can be propagated forward to predict and compensate for the uncertainty in dynamics under intermittent loss of state feedback. Comparative simulation results are provided on a two-link manipulator system and an unmanned underwater vehicle system with intermittent loss of state feedback, where the developed method yields significant performance improvement compared to baseline methods.",

                "value": "This paper is introducing an adaptive DNN-based controller. Standard adaptive DNN-based controllers are based on Lyapunov-based analysis and allow updates on the last layers of the NNs only. They only use the tracking error as a metric to indicate when adaptation is needed, and only provide guarantees on the tracking error convergence. This paper introduces a dual (composite) method, for continuous system identification combined with trajectory tracking, and guarantees that the tracking error, state-derivative estimation error, and DNN weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. The last two reflect identifying the dynamics of the system.\nThe system identification is performed via a dynamic state-derivative estimator and under the assumption of persitence of excitatiton. The controller is evaluated in simulation on a two-link manipulator system and an unmanned underwater vehicle system with intermittent loss of state feedback, and shows improvement compared to baseline methods."

With the emergence of AI-based approaches, a principled treatment of a learning-based controller is an impactful contribution. Introducing a controller which allows for updates in all layers, in contrast to the state of the art where only thelast layers can be updated, and where system dynamics is not considered explicitely, is a big contribution. \nGiven the complexity of the paper, it is very clearly presented. The simulation examples are relevant and not just datasets, but dynamical systems."

It is claimed that the tracking, state-derivative, and weight estimation errors can be guaranteed to converge to bounded sets. **The factors that determine the upper bounds** of convergence sets should be provided in the Abstract.\n\n3. The previous work (OConnell, 2022) is compared in the Intro. It is claimed the limitation of the composite adaptive approach used by OConnell, 2022, is the inner-layer weight cannot be online updated. However, the considered case of OConnell, 2022 is different from the one of this paper. OConnell mainly focuses on a composited disturbance, which comes from external disturbance and internal state-related uncertainties. The last layer of DNN is updated online to handle external disturbances, while the inner layers correspond to internal state-related uncertainties, which would not change in application. However, the internal state-related uncertainty is mainly considered in this paper, i.e., $f({x, \\dot{x}})$. **The direct comparison with (OConnell, 2022) is inappropriate**.\n\n4. One important problem is only simulation examples are demonstrated in this paper, and no noises exist in the measured states, despite the theorems that seem to be relatively complete. A small upper bound of the convergence set depends on a large gain. However, the gain may enlarge the noises in a real system. Thus, **the effect of the real application is questionable**.\n\n5. In the simulation of two link manipulators, it is recommended to cover the ESO comparison and the composite adaptive method developed in (Slotine and Li, 1989). The gain selection strategy for all comparison methods should be provided to ensure fairness."

It seems the proposed update strategy only relies on current measurements and has no historical data-mining procedure. It is a kind of traditional adaptive control, instead of modern data-based learning. Maybe a control journal is more applicable to this paper.\n\n2. If the considered uncertainty $f({x, \\dot{x}})$ can be extended to the composited disturbance, like $f({x, \\dot{x}, d})$, where $d$ denotes the external disturbance. It will be valuable in real applications."
