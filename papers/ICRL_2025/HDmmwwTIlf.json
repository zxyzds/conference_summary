    "abstract": "Neural network PDE solvers have recently gained popularity.However, it faces difficulty to deal with sharp discontinuity like shock waves in hyperbolic conservation laws.In this paper we propose a characteristic-based neural network to solve one dimension hyperbolic laws.The smooth solution can be derived by equation of characteristic lines ,and shock waves are decided by simple ODE solver.This method achieves a high accuracy with high efficiency. In the future it is hopeful to apply this method to higher dimension problems.",

The CBNN divides the problem domain into subregions, each influenced by a distinct portion of the initial conditions. It then approximates the smooth solution within each subregion using the characteristic lines and addresses discontinuities, such as shock waves, by solving ordinary differential equations based on the Rankine\u2013Hugoniot condition. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach numerical experiments on the Burgers' equation, a well-known example of a hyperbolic conservation law."

To demonstrate the robustness and broader applicability of the proposed method, additional examples involving various hyperbolic conservation laws, as well as more complex initial and boundary conditions, are needed.\n3. The paper suffers from numerous typos, grammatical errors, and unclear representation of the concepts. This poor presentation makes it challenging to understand the proposed method and evaluate its merit fully.\n4. The paper claims to address the challenges of discontinuities in hyperbolic conservation laws.

This would strengthen the demonstration of CBNN's robustness and general applicability.\n3. How does the choice of neural network architecture and hyperparameters affect the performance of CBNN?\n4. Since CBNN addresses challenges related to discontinuities and the R-H condition is applied for shock wave computation, could you provide a more detailed comparison with the NDNN approach by Lorin and Novruz?

The paper includes a theoretical bound on the loss function and carries out numerical experiments for Burger\u2019s equation.\n\nThe main idea of the method, as formulated in Section 2.2, is to approximate the PDE solution by a neural network and train it, so as to minimize the loss function formulated in (6). The loss function in (6) is motivated by the representation (5) of the solution. This is similar to the case of PINNs, but instead of aiming to force the neural network to satisfy the PDE, here the approach aims to directly force the neural network to satisfy (5)."

While in principle the developed approach is interesting, other neural network-based methods have already been developed to tackle the same class of PDEs, see Lorin & Novruzi (2024) and Liu et al. (2023) cited in the paper. The paper under review claims that, for these methods, convergence is hard to guarantee under complex circumstances like multiple shock waves. However, no theoretical or experimental evidence is provided and it is also not shown that the new method is capable of addressing this issue. Thus, experiments do not provide convincing evidence of the significance of the proposed approach in comparison to existing methods. Additionally, the new method specifically aims to solve PDEs with discontinuous initial conditions, but Assumption 1 requires that the initial condition is differentiable, hence continuous. Experiments are carried out solely for Burgers' equations and, even though other approaches exist, no benchmark neural network methods are tested. Finally, there are no details regarding the implementation and choices of hyperparameters, see below for a list of questions regarding these."

Given that you truncate the domain in several parts and solve the PDE separately in each part, it seems that you could also apply PINNs directly on each part - have you considered this approach?\n2. You claim that for the approaches by Lorin & Novruzi (2024) and Liu et al. (2023), convergence is hard to guarantee under complex circumstances like multiple shock waves. Can you provide theoretical or experimental evidence for this claim?\n3. Did you carry out numerical experiments which show that your approach does not face this issue in presence of multiple shock waves?\n4. In the proof of Lemma 1 it is stated that $u_0'\\geq 0$ implies $\\lambda'\\geq 0$. Why is this true?\n5. You claim that your theoretical results show that, as the number of shock waves increases, the accuracy and training efficiency are still guaranteed. I could not find any support for this claim, could you be more specific here? The result was only proved under Assumption 1, which seems to exclude shock waves?\n\n\n### Questions regarding implementation:\nThe paper leaves open several crucial details related to the implementation. For example:\n\n1. Which neural network architecture was used in experiments? \n2. Which training algorithm was used?\n3. How many data points were used?\n4. How were the exact solutions in the experiments of Section 4.2 computed?\n5. What sampling scheme was used to sample the points $x_b^i$?\n6. In the experiments, is the reported MSE the minimal neural network loss or the distance to the true solution?\n7. On what grid was the $L^2$ error evaluated in the experiments?\n\n\n\n### Additional comments that did not impact the score:\n1. Capitalizations are missing at the beginning of Sections 2.1 and 4.1\n2. Punctuation and spacing is wrong throughout the paper: there should be a space after commas, not before them. There should be a space after each full stop.\n3. Please label axes of Figures to allow readers to understand which axes represents $x$ and $t$ variables, respectively. \n4. Can you comment on potential limitations for high-dimensional equations? What is the reason that you formulated the method only for one-dimensional PDEs?\n5. Once you write Burgers equation, once Burger\u2019s equation.\n6. Sections 2.4-2.6 refer to 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, which does not appear correct. \n7. Lemma 1 is referred to as a theorem in several places. Why do you label it a lemma then?"
