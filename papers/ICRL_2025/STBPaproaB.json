    "title": "MARS: A neurosymbolic approach for interpretable drug discovery",
    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence describes the combination of logic or rule-based techniques with neural networks. Compared to neural approaches, NeSy methods often possess enhanced interpretability, which is particularly promising for biomedical applications like drug discovery. However, since interpretability is broadly defined, there are no clear guidelines for assessing the biological plausibility of model interpretations. To assess interpretability in the context of drug discovery, we devise a novel prediction task, called drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) deconvolution, with an associated, tailored knowledge graph (KG), MoA-net. We then develop the MoA Retrieval System (MARS), a NeSy approach for drug discovery which leverages logical rules with learned rule weights. Using this interpretable feature alongside domain knowledge, we find that MARS and other NeSy approaches on KGs are susceptible to reasoning shortcuts, in which the prediction of true labels is driven by \"degree-bias\" rather than the domain-based rules. Subsequently, we demonstrate ways to identify and mitigate this. Thereafter, MARS achieves performance on par with current state-of-the-art models while producing model interpretations aligned with known MoAs.",

                "value": "This work proposes a new neurosymbolic (NeSy) model for drug discovery as well as an associated dataset, where the problem is cast as a prediction task for drug-biological process (BP) pairs. More specifically, biochemical knowledge is arranged into a knowledge graph (KG) where entities (vertices) such as drugs, proteins and BP are connected with each other via directed edges. By using a new update rule of edge weights, the new model was able to avoid reasoning shortcuts inherent in previous methods."
