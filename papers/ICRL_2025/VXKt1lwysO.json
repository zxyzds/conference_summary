    "title": "ATLAS: Automatic Local Symmetry Discovery",
    "abstract": "Existing symmetry discovery methods predominantly focus on global transformations across the entire system or space, but they are unable to capture the symmetries in local neighborhoods. This may result in the reported symmetry group being a misrepresentation of the true symmetry. In this paper, we formalize the notion of local symmetry as atlas equivariance. Our proposed pipeline, automatic local symmetry discovery (ATLAS), recovers the local symmetries of a function by training local predictor networks and then learning a Lie group basis to which the predictors are equivariant. We demonstrate ATLAS is capable of discovering local symmetry groups with multiple connected components in top-quark tagging and partial differential equation experiments. The discovered local symmetry is shown to be a useful inductive bias that improves the performance of downstream tasks in climate segmentation and vision tasks.",

The authors provide formal descriptions of the locality and equivariance of ATLAS, along with algorithms for discovering infinitesimal generators and discrete symmetries. Results from these experiments show that integrating the discovered symmetries into downstream models can enhance performance. Through experiments involving top-quark tagging, synthetic PDEs, MNIST classification, and climate segmentation, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ATLAS in discovering local symmetries and integrating them into gauge equivariant networks, leading to improved performance metrics."

The definitions of Atlas Locality and Atlas Equivariance both contain the term \"Atlas,\" an abbreviation for the authors' method, i.e., Automatic Local Symmetry Discovery. Defining a mathematical object using the abbreviation of a specific method is uncommon and could lead to confusion. Additionally, the authors do not clearly differentiate atlas locality from general locality, nor do they clarify how atlas equivariance differs from equivariance to conventional local transformations.\n2. While the authors emphasize the importance of local equivariance, many deep learning tasks, such as natural language processing and video understanding, exhibit long-range dependencies, highlighting the coupling of local and global equivariance. Is the proposed framework applicable in these scenarios?\n3. The authors report only the final results of their complete method in each experiment, lacking ablation studies and fine-grained visualizations of features to provide a more credible explanation of their approach.\n4. The descriptions of experimental details are somewhat lacking, particularly concerning the discovery of symmetry and its integration with neural networks on specific datasets.\n5. The paper conducts many experiments, and for the MNIST classification task, it projects the data onto a spherical space. What are the physical meanings or practical applications of this projection? \n6. Although the paper provides the steps of the ATLAS algorithm, there is limited analysis on the time and space complexity of the algorithm. It is recommended to include this section to assess its feasibility for applications on large-scale datasets."

While the three experiments in Section 5 provide concrete examples, the connections between group actions, cosets, and the datasets are not immediately apparent. It would be beneficial for the authors to explicitly state these connections within each experimental subsection to enhance clarity.\n\n3. The objective of the experimental section lacks clarity. If the primary goal is benchmarking, the comparisons with other methods appear limited. On the other hand, if the goal is to illustrate the advantages of local symmetries over global symmetries, it remains unclear how these local symmetries contribute to downstream tasks.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I disagree with the core argument of this paper: previous methods for symmetry discovery could only find global symmetry rather than local symmetry. In Algorithm 1, the atlas $\\mathcal{A}$ of the manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ needs to be specified manually. However, after completing this step, we can treat the symmetry discovery for each chart $(U_c, \\varphi_c)$ as separate subproblems, with their common symmetry being the atlas symmetry. These subproblems do not differ from global symmetry discovery, as mentioned in Definition 2, where each mapping $\\Phi_c$ is globally equivariant. Therefore, previous methods for symmetry discovery can be naturally extended to the case of local symmetry. For example, we can apply LieGG [1] on each trained predictor $\\Phi_c$, or apply LieGAN [2] on the data of each chart $\\mathcal{D_c} = \\\\{(X_i: U_c \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{in}}, Y_i: U_c \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{out}})\\\\}_{i=1}^{n_c}$.\n\n- ATLAS simply treats group generators as learnable parameters and optimizes the equivariant loss $\\mathcal{L}(\\Phi_c(g \\cdot x), g \\cdot \\Phi_c(x))$. I think that this approach has limited contributions to the problem of symmetry discovery. It does not show significant advantages over previous methods and has some drawbacks. For example, compared with LieGG [1], which mathematically solves Lie algebra bases, ATLAS has poorer interpretability; compared with LieGAN [2], which directly discovers symmetries from datasets, ATLAS is highly dependent on the accuracy of trained predictors. Furthermore, in Appendix B, it is mentioned that the number of Lie algebra bases $k$ is determined by incrementally increasing from a minimum value. Will this lead to significant computational overhead when the true $k$ is large? If the norm of the weakest generator varies continuously, will changes in the set threshold also affect the final result for $k$?  \n\n- The reason why the method can work lacks rigorous explanation. See the first two questions for details.\n\n- Suggestion on presentation: \"atlas\" refers to a collection of local regions or charts that cover a manifold, while \"ATLAS\" stands for automatic local symmetry discovery.

                "value": "- Does Equation (3) in Section 4.2.1 (calculating the absolute value first and then the cosine similarity) have any practical significance mathematically? I am skeptical about whether it works in all cases. Can you provide a theoretical proof that when $\\mathcal{L}_{str}(B)$ is minimized, the number of non-zero elements shared among different basis vectors is also minimized?\n\n- In Section 4.2.2, when learning coset representatives, even though the number of random matrices $K$ is much larger than the actual number of cosets, will all these matrices converge to the strong symmetry embodied by the predictor $\\Phi_c$? Formally, if for $\\forall C \\neq C_1, C_2$, we have $\\mathcal{L}(\\Phi_c(C_1 \\cdot x), C_1 \\cdot \\Phi_c(x)) < \\mathcal{L}(\\Phi_c(C_2 \\cdot x), C_2 \\cdot \\Phi_c(x)) \\ll \\mathcal{L}(\\Phi_c(C \\cdot x), C \\cdot \\Phi_c(x))$ (where we omit the normalization notation for brevity). In this case, it is possible that all matrices converge to $C_1$ while missing the symmetry corresponding to $C_2$.\n\n- In Section 5.2, does the $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ transformation refer to rotating the entire field around the origin of the coordinate system, or does it refer to rotating each chart separately around its center point? In Figure 6b, which charts correspond to local predictors $\\Phi_c$ that exhibit global symmetry?\n\n- In the assumptions of Theorem 1, it is already mentioned that $M$ is $G$ gauge equivariant. Is it necessary to further elaborate that $M$ is $G$ equivariant in the third paragraph of the proof? When the manifold is Euclidean space, are gauge equivariance and equivariance naturally equivalent?"
