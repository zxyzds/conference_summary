    "title": "AnomalyTCN: Dual-branch Convolution with Contrastive Representation for Efficient Time Series Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the rising contrastive-based method for time series anomaly detection, which works on the idea of contrastive discrepancy learning and breaks through the performance bottleneck of previous reconstruction-based methods. But we also find that, existing contrastive-based methods only work with the complicated attention mechanisms, which brings heavier computational costs. To address this efficiency issue, we propose AnomalyTCN as a more efficient and effective contrastive-based solution. In detail, we design a dual-branch convolution structure to produce different representations of the same input under two different views for contrastive learning. Then we adopt the representation discrepancy between these two branches as a more distinguishable criterion to detect the anomalies, leading to better detection performance. Meanwhile, since we adopt a simple and light-weight pure convolution structure to avoid the complicated attention computation, our method can enjoy much more advantages in efficiency. Experimentally, our AnomalyTCN achieves the consistent state-of-the-art performance on various time series anomaly detection tasks while saving 83.6\\% running time and 20.1\\% memory usage. These results validate that our AnomalyTCN is a novel solution for time series anomaly detection with a better balance of performance and efficiency.",

This paper proposes two branches of convolution, i.e., dense and dilated, to learn two views of time series. Then, the contrastive learning method is applied to learn a time series anomaly detection. However, this structure is widely used in other research areas, and it is trivial to apply this structure again in the application of time series anomaly detection. \n\n- Some experiments show that the proposed method has very minor improvements on many datasets, e.g., SMD, SMAP, SWaT, PSM, and NIPS-TS-SWAN. With these minor improvements and the trivial of the proposed method, it makes the reader to wonder the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, dual-branch contrastive-based time series anomaly detection is already proposed by DCdetector [1], and there are also pure convolution structure time series anomaly detection models, such as [2]. The contributions and novelty are limited. The authors should compare these prior works by experiments and provide a detailed comparison highlighting the key technical differences and innovations of their method.\n\n   [1] DCdetector: Dual Attention Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection.

As the efficiency by pure convolution structure is the main contribution, why the authors compare efficiency with only one Transformer based model? The authors should compare efficiency and effectiveness with other convolution structure time series anomaly detection models, such as TimesNet, ModernTCN and [2], as well as non-learning anomaly detection methods, such as [3] and [4]. The authors should use more metrics to compare efficiency (e.g. training time, inference time, memory usage, model parameters) across more models.\n \n   [3] Matrix Profile XXIX: C22MP, Fusing catch 22 and the Matrix Profile to Produce an Efficient and Interpretable Anomaly Detector.

The main weakness of this paper is that the authors use the wrong evaluation metrics. The authors use the point adjustment (PA) for evaluation. Many works [2, 5, 6, 7] have demonstrated that PA can lead to faulty performance evaluations, where PA use true labels from the test datasets to adjust the outputs of models, and it is known that using PA can result in state-of-the-art performance even with random scores or random initialized non-trained models [6, 7], making it impossible to conduct a fair comparison and assess the effectiveness of the models. The showed effectiveness in this paper is flawed. The authors should use alternative evaluation metrics, such as original F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Aff Recall, Precision and F1 [6, 7], instead of PA. The authors should re-run their experiments with these reasonable metrics and discuss how it impacts their results and conclusions.\n\n   [5] Current Time Series Anomaly Detection Benchmarks are Flawed and are Creating the Illusion of Progress.
