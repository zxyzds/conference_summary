    "title": "MedFuzz: Exploring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply robust performance in real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that could help the LLM perform in practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how robust LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance is to violations of unrealistic benchmark assumptions.  Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing).  MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting unrealistic assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful \"attacks\" modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless \"trick\" the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a non-parametric test for calculating the statistic significance of a successful attack. We show how to use calculate \"MedFuzzed\" performance on a medical QA benchmark, as well to find individual cases of statistically significant successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings.",

                "value": "This paper investigates the robustness of large language models in handling medical QA tasks by introducing a new evaluation method, MedFuzz. For each multiple-choice question in the original benchmarks, MedFuzz uses an LLM (referred to as the attacker LLM) to reformulate questions by adding patient characteristics that may introduce social bias without affecting the clinical decision-making process. If the target LLM answers correctly, the attacker LLM is prompted to generate additional distracting questions based on the target LLM\u2019s feedback. Additionally, a non-parametric statistical significance test was developed by prompting the attacker LLM to create questions with patient characteristics that avoid social bias. Using this evaluation method, the authors tested seven LLMs and found a significant performance drop across all models. Moreover, they observed that when current LLMs answer incorrectly, they tend not to reference the added biased information, indicating inconsistency in faithfully adhering to the clinical decision-making process."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "+ A major weakness of this paper is the faithfulness of the reformulated questions. The proposed MedFuzz method relies solely on prompt engineering with the attacker LLM (GPT-4) to modify original MedQA questions, making the attack process difficult to control. The attacker LLM may potentially alter critical information in the original questions, resulting in less reliable reformulated questions. The example in Section 3.1 also demonstrates that the attacker LLM added extensive information about the patient\u2019s family medical history, consultation history, and medication history. These details are highly relevant in real clinical diagnosis and can significantly influence a doctor\u2019s assessment of the patient\u2019s condition.\n\n+ Moreover, although the authors propose a non-parametric statistical significance test, they do not provide the full distribution of p-values across the MedQA benchmark. In line 485, they note that for the successful attacks they selected, the p-values are <1/30, 0.1, 0.16, 0.5, and 0.63. Here, the p-value represents the probability that a control fuzz is more challenging than the original fuzz. Therefore, cases with p-values of 0.5 and 0.63 suggest that the performance decline in the target LLM is due to the perturbations themselves, rather than social bias.\n\n+ For the study of target LLM's faithfulness, it is important to also study the proportion of CoT that mentions the critical information in the original MedQA benchmark for comparison with the results provided in Figure 2B. Additionally, the authors should provide more information to help readers understand the specific process of this study. For example, how many cases were analyzed? Was the determination of whether fuzzed information was included made manually, or was an automated algorithm used?"

Which specific diseases or problem types is the target LLM less robust against? By supplementing these analyses, further insights can be provided for the development of medical LLMs."

How stable is it broadly in identifying how significant a successful attack is? I understand this can be computationally intensive and costly but that also raises a bit of questions regarding the applicability of the method if it can't be done at scale. \n* The presentation could have been improved to provide some intuition at the beginning with potentially a simpler case study where less was added to make the LLM response change. Similarly, some of the text is written in a less digestible format.

                "value": "1. The paper defines robustness as the model\u2019s ability to maintain performance in varied scenarios, which may lead to confusion with the concept of \u201cgeneralization.\u201d Typically, robustness refers to a model's resilience to perturbations or intentional adversarial attacks. To clarify the core aim of this study, a more explicit definition of robustness in the context of MedFuzz is recommended, particularly regarding how MedFuzz is designed to evaluate LLM robustness beyond generalization. Explaining how robustness is measured and differentiated from generalization could provide readers with a clearer understanding of the intended contribution.\n2. MedFuzz incorporates specific patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, family history, background) as perturbations to assess LLM robustness; however, this approach may not accurately reflect clinical settings. Patient background information typically aids diagnostic decisions rather than introducing confusion. For instance, a patient\u2019s age or medical history often plays a crucial role in diagnosis and would rarely be considered extraneous. Thus, further justification on why these characteristics are appropriate for simulating robustness under MedFuzz is recommended. Clarifying which patient data might clinically support decisions versus truly confuse the model would strengthen the study\u2019s validity.\n3. The scale of text modification applied in MedFuzz risks excessive deviation from the original context, potentially impacting the robustness assessment. In section 3.1, for instance, added text can exceed 40% of the original passage, potentially leading to unintentional confusion beyond MedFuzz\u2019s intended perturbation. A more focused perturbation approach\u2014such as limiting changes to key sentences or reducing the proportion of added text\u2014could provide a more accurate robustness assessment. This adjustment would align MedFuzz\u2019s modifications closer to realistic conditions while still effectively evaluating LLM robustness.\n4. After applying MedFuzz, the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations produced by the LLM were noted to omit important information, suggesting reduced fidelity. However, it is unclear whether this reduction in fidelity is due to MedFuzz\u2019s perturbations or the LLM\u2019s inherent limitations. It is recommended to first assess the fidelity and consistency of CoT explanations on the original benchmark without MedFuzz to identify the root cause of CoT discrepancies. Such an analysis would clarify whether the fidelity issues stem from MedFuzz or from the model itself, providing clearer insights into the reliability of the CoT explanations in real-world scenarios."

I am curious whether the patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and social bias information added as perturbations in MedFuzz genuinely act as confusion factors within actual clinical environments. These details often serve as crucial data points in clinical decision-making, so further explanation on how these elements were deemed appropriate as confusion-inducing factors would enhance the clinical validity of this study.\n\n3. A clear explanation regarding the rationale for setting the perturbation iteration count to K=5 would be beneficial. For instance, do you have experimental results comparing the initial attack (K=1) with subsequent attacks (K=5) to illustrate how the LLM maintains performance with increasing perturbation levels? Such a comparison could provide a more reliable basis for evaluating the impact of iteration count on robustness in this study."
