    "title": "COFlowNet: Conservative Constraints on Flows Enable High-Quality Candidate Generation",
    "abstract": "Generative flow networks (GFlowNet) have been considered as powerful tools for generating candidates with desired property. Given that evaluating the property of candidates can be complex and time-consuming, existing GFlowNets train proxy models for efficient online evaluation. However, the performance of proxy models is heavily dependent on the amount of data and is of considerable uncertainty. Therefore, it is of great interest that how to develop an offline GFlowNet which does not rely on online evaluating. \nUnder offline setting, the limited data results in insufficient exploration of state space. \nThe insufficient exploration means that offline GFlowNets can hardly generate satisfying candidates out of the distribution of training data. Therefore, it is critical to restrict the offline model to act in distribution of training data. The distinctive training goal of GFlownets poses unique challenge for making such restriction.\nTackling the challenge, we proposes Conservative Offline GFlowNet (COFlowNet) in this paper. We define unsupported flow, edges containing unseen states in training data. Models can learn extremely few knowledge about unsupported flow from training data. By constraining the model from exploring unsupported flows, we restrict COFlowNet to explore as optimal trajectories on the training set as possible, thus generating better candidates. In order to improve the diversity of candidates, we further introduce quantile version of unsupported flow restriction. Experimental result on several widely-used datasets validates the effectiveness of COFlowNet on generating high-scored and diverse candidates.

                "value": "This paper tackles the generation task, which aims to search for state transitions with high rewards. The fundamental task strongly impacts generating or searching for plausible candidates of sequences, where its possible applications include molecule design or path generation.\nTo this end, the authors have proposed COFlowNet, which focuses on finding high-reward state transitions by simply regularizing unsupported flows. The efficacy of the method is confirmed in Hypergrid and Molecule Design tasks."

However, COFlowNet is only compared with GFlowNet, which makes it hard to figure out the quantitative gains of COFlowNet over MCMC and PPO. It is better to add these two baselines in the experiments.\n- Moreover, only the main experiment considered in this paper, which includes the comparisons with others, is Molecule Design. (I have not published works for this topic) In literature, is there any other task to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method? A single demonstration seems to be limited to say the consistent and meaningful gains of COFlowNet over others.\n\n**Minor Comment 1:** For consistency, please choose the one among COFlowNet or COFlownet."

                "value": "The paper present a method to the problem of offline GFlowNet training. Many conventional approaches require approximating training scores/rewards of candidate model outputs to provide a variety of generated candidate solutions, however, this approach is sensitive to out-of-distribution data. In this work the authors remove any reliance on proxy models for estimating the candidate to reward optimization objective for GFlowNet training. The authors propose to constrain the actions that a GFlowNet model may take to generate an output sample such that only actions supported by the training data are permissible. The authors show that their flow regularization only positively affects training on the supported flow paths, and that their approach is truly offline and can improve candidate model diversity."

Are there other potential ways of increasing diversity during GFlowNet regularization that were explored aside from the quantile matching algorithm? \n4. Can COFlowNet be easily extended to other domains where RL is popular, like game playing and autonomous vehicle driving for example?"
