    "title": "FreqPrior: Improving Diffusion Models with Frequency Filtering Gaussian Noise as Prior",
    "abstract": "Text-driven video generation has advanced significantly due to developments in diffusion models. Beyond the training and sampling phases, recent studies have investigated noise priors of diffusion models, as improved noise priors yield better generation results. One recent approach employs Fourier transform to manipulate noise, marking the initial exploration of frequency operations in this context. However, it often generates videos that lack motion dynamics and imaging details. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the variance decay issue present in existing methods, contributing to the loss of details and motion dynamics. Recognizing the critical impact of noise distribution on generation quality, we introduce FreqPrior, a novel noise initialization strategy that refines noise in the frequency domain.  Our method features a novel filtering technique designed to address different frequency signals while maintaining the noise prior distribution that closely approximates a standard Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a partial sampling process by perturbing the latent at an intermediate timestep during finding the noise prior, significantly reducing inference time without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method achieves the highest scores in both quality and semantic assessments, resulting in the best overall total score. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed noise prior.",

The authors introduce a new frequency filtering method to refine noise priors, improving video quality by preserving essential details and dynamics better than existing baselines such as Gaussian noise, mixed noise, progressive noise, and FreeInit. The core motivation is to keep the standard Gaussian distribution for the frequency-based sampling refinement process. The method requires additional sampling iterations but offers notable performance improvements across multiple metrics evaluated on the VBench benchmark. The experiments are conducted using three open-source text-to-video models (VideoCrafter, ModelScope, and AnimateDiff), and the results highlight that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in both quantitative and qualitative aspects."
