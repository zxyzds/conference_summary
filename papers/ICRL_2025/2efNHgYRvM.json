    "title": "On the Identification of Temporal Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence",
    "abstract": "Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \\textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\\textbf{O}us \\textbf{L}atent dynamics (\\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.",

The authors establish identifiability up to permutation of the latent variables and demonstrate that the underlying causal graph can be identified up to its Markov equivalence class (if this interpretation is correct). They thoroughly discuss the limitations of their assumptions in comparison to recent works, which helps underscore the significance of the proposed framework.\n\nAn estimation method is also introduced, with experiments on synthetic data verifying the theoretical results, while real-world experiments highlight the importance of incorporating instantaneous dependencies."

                "value": "**Minor Concerns**\n- **Computational Complexity:** The sparsity constraint introduced in Eq. (11) seems to introduce significant computational complexity to the algorithm. The paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis regarding this. For example, would it be possible to compute wall-clock times (in training) for IDOL in comparison the proposed baselines?\n- **Scalability to High-Dimensional Data:** The authors acknowledge limitations with respect to high-dimensional data, which can restrict the application to real-world scenarios. An experiment to understand how high-dimensional one can go with IDOL would be ideal to support your point to understand how high one could go for IDOL.\n\n**Major Concern: Theory Section Clarity and Limitations**\n\nThe paper\u2019s theoretical claims, particularly around identifiability, would benefit from clarification to avoid potential misunderstandings regarding the nature of identifiability achieved. It appears that IDOL identifies the latent Markov Network rather than the true causal graph for the instantaneous component of the latent dynamics. This is an important distinction, as conditional independence relations allow only for the identification of the Markov equivalence class, not the directed causal structure itself. However, the presentation throughout the paper, especially in the introduction, experiments (such as Figure 4), and conclusions, may lead readers to infer that IDOL identifies the causal graph rather than the Markov network.\n\nTo address this issue, the authors could consider the following changes:\n\n- **Introduction (around line 89):** Indicate that the identifiability of the instantaneous structure in IDOL is only up to a Markov equivalence class, clarifying that IDOL does not identify the directions of edges in the instantaneous part.\n- **Figure 1c Modification:** Consider modifying Figure 1c to remove the arrow pointers from edges, signaling that the result is a Markov network rather than a causal graph when discussing identifiability (this might make sense in terms of theory, but not from a data generation perspective).\n- **Conclusion:** Mention the Markov equivalence class limitation explicitly. This would open a path for further research to extend the identifiability result from Markov equivalence to the full causal structure, especially given the promising empirical results observed in Figure 4.\n\nThe following specific statements in the theory section could be revised to improve clarity and accuracy:\n\n- lines 130-132: \u201cthe latent causal relations are also immediately identifiable because conditional independence relations fully characterize instantaneous causal relations in an instantaneous causally sufficient system\u201d. I don\u2019t think this line is correct without any additional assumptions. Conditional independence relations only provide the Markov equivalence class, not the exact causal graph, without further assumptions. Rephrasing this to accurately reflect the distinction between the Markov equivalence class and the causal graph would strengthen the theoretical foundation.\n- lines 171-172: Could you indicate whether $p_{c_t}$ refers to the marginal distribution $p(c_t)$ or the conditional distribution $p(c_t|z_{t-2})$?\nlines 165-188: For better readability, could you indicate $c_t \\in R^{2n}$ in your example? Otherwise, at first glance it reads as  $\\{z_{t,i}, z_{t-1,i} \\}$ for $c_{t,i}$ in Theorem 1.\n- line 217: Would it be better to use $\\emptyset$ to refer to $\\Phi$ as an empty set?\n- line 230: Could you define \u201cisomorphic\u201d for Markov networks? A footnote or reference to the Appendix suffices."

You are using $\\mathcal{L}$ and $L$ interchangeably. Could you revise this?\n- If I am not mistaken, your identifiability theory does not obtain the causal graph, but a markov equivalence of it (please correct if mistaken). Yet apparently, the synthetic experiments suggest that you estimate the instantaneous causal graph with 100% accuracy (Figure 4, bottom left). Could you provide some explanation for this? For example, is it possible that your assumptions allow for stronger identifiability results that are overlooked in the presented theory?"

Traditional approaches for identifying latent causal processes in time series data often assume that the latent causal variables lack instantaneous interactions, limiting real-world applicability. IDOL addresses this limitation by applying a sparsity constraint on causal influences, allowing for both time-delayed and instantaneous dependencies in latent variables. The IDOL frameworkassumes a sparse influence within latent causal processes, allowing both time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Unlike prior methods that require data interventions or predefined groupings to achieve identifiability, IDOL elies on this sparse latent structure alone, making it highly applicable to scenarios where interventions are impractical. The framework\u2019s theoretical foundation is built on leveraging sufficient variability and temporal contextual information, establishing identifiability through a combination of variational inference and sparsity regularization. This enables the model to accurately reconstruct latent variables and the underlying causal relationships without complex external assumptions."

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates rigorous theoretical and empirical quality, supported by a well-founded identifiability proof and a solid mathematical framework. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real-world human motion datasets further underscores the robustness and reliability of the model, showcasing its ability to accurately identify causal relationships and achieve high predictive accuracy is synthetic and real-world datasets.

In some scenarios, particularly in non-linear and noisy environments, this assumption could lead to inaccurate or incomplete latent representations, potentially undermining the model\u2019s performance and causal interpretability. Furthermore, IDOL\u2019s effectiveness heavily depends on the assumption of a sparse latent process. In cases where this sparsity assumption does not hold (i.e., when the causal structure is dense or complex), IDOL\u2019s performance degrades, as demonstrated in the experiments. This sensitivity suggests that the framework may be less robust in scenarios where latent processes are highly interconnected."
