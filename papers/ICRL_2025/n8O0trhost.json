    "title": "cryoSPHERE: Single-Particle HEterogeneous REconstruction from cryo EM",
    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of proteins plays a crucial role in determining their function. Protein structure prediction methods, like AlphaFold, offer rapid access to a protein\u2019s structure. However, large protein complexes cannot be reliably predicted, and proteins are dynamic, making it important to resolve their full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful tool for determining the structures of large protein complexes. Importantly, the numerous images of a given protein contain underutilized information about conformational heterogeneity. These images are very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo-EM reconstruction are limited to recovering only one or a few consensus conformations.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, which is a deep learning method that uses a nominal protein structure (e.g., from AlphaFold) as input, learns how to divide it into segments, and moves these segments as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo-EM dataset. This approach provides enough constraints to enable meaningful reconstructions of single protein structural ensembles. We demonstrate this with two synthetic datasets featuring varying levels of noise, as well as one real dataset. We show that cryoSPHERE is very resilient to the high levels of noise typically encountered in experiments, where we see consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.",

                "value": "Major:\n1. CryoSPHERE uses an atomic model as the reference and formulate the conformational heterogeneity in cryo-EM dataset as the deformation of the segments of the reference model. In finding the optimal segments, the approach is similar to what used in e2gmm, where a GMM with N_{segm} components is fitted. This segmentation result is then used in a cryoSTAR/DynaMight-like setting, replacing the regularization losses and compute predicted projections to compare with the particle images. The author should also compare the result with other similar methods, including DynaMight, e2gmm, and maybe 3DFlex, and discuss the outcomes.\n\n2. In cryo-EM, density maps are extremely important in evaluating the validity of the results. However, the authors only presented the density maps for one of the synthetic dataset. Especially in the case of under the hypothesis that the heterogeneity is modeled as the deformations of a canonical density, it is very important that the reconstructed canonical density is free from any obvious artifact.\n\n3. The FSC comparison in Sec. 5.2 between cryoSPHERE and cryoDRGN and cryoSTAR may not be very fair, since cryoSPHERE's density is reconstructed under the assumption that there exist a canonical density, while cryoDRGN does not hold the same hypothesis, and cryoSTAR explicitly avoids this to reduce the unwanted bias from the reference model. A fair comparison would be made against DynaMight and 3DFlex.\n\n4. Lack of ablation study. The authors should discuss how N_{segm}, which is a key hyperparameter that is related to the degree of freedom in the segmentation, affects the results in both synthetic and real data.\n\n5. The authors compare cryoSPHERE to cryoDRGN and cryoSTAR, but from the experiments, it is unclear what the advantage that cryoSPHERE brings to the field. The only advantage seems to be the increase FSC resolution, but it is only shown in one synthetic dataset.\n\nMinor:\n1. The sequence of Fig.6 and Fig.7 in the paper is reversed.\n2. In the related works, e2gmm should also be considered as a method using deep learning.\n3. In the FSC comparison, if not comparing two half maps, the cutoff of 0.5 should be used and 0.143 is not meaningful. See [1] appendix for the reason (and also why 0.143 is the number widely used for half maps comprison). Therefore the discussion at the end of Sec. 5.2 about 0.5 and 0.143 cutoff improvement is not very correct.\n4. The writing could be better polished.\n5.

This might be challenging"

            "questions": {
                "value": "Questions for clarification \n- In section 3.6 the authors say \u201cSimilar to Li et al. (2023), instead of using a mean squared error loss between the predicted and ground truth image, we use a correlation loss between the true and predicted image\u201d. However, they do not motivate this choice. Would you please care to elaborate?\n- In section 5.1 the authors write \u201cTesting the segment decomposition, we then run cryoSPHERE by requesting division into Nsegm = 4. The program learnt a first and third segment with 0 residues, a second segment with 1353 residues and a fourth segment with 157 residues (Figure 5). Thus, cryoSPHERE learnt segments according to the ground truth.\u201d Is there a reason why we should expect that the model prefers to learn two segments?\n\nAdditional feedback\n- It reads as if equation 7 is the only loss that is being used. I assume that the VAE latent distribution is also trainable? It would benefit the readability if the authors clarify whether the loss is just the decoder loss or the whole loss.\u201c\n- In section 5.3 the authors write \u201cThe first two principal components explain more than 96 percent of the variance.\u201d In general, I would be very reluctant to make any claims about PCA in the latent space as you could come up with a transformation that scrambles the latent space and still gives the same decoding, but covers much less variance. I can imagine that Figure 7 is a nice illustration, but I would recommend to leave it with that."
