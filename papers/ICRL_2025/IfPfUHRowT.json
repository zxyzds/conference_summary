    "title": "Inpainting the Sinogram from Computed Tomography using Latent Diffusion Model and Physics",
    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging technique for materials at microscopic or sub-microscopic length scales in synchrotron radiation facilities. Typically, the object is rotated relative to the X-ray beam, and 2D projection images are recorded by the detector at different rotation angles. The 3D object is then reconstructed by combining these projections and solving a computationally demanding inverse problem. The quality of the reconstructed image is critical for scientific analysis and is influenced by various factors, including the number of projections, exposure time or dose, and the reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we develop a foundation model by integrating a Generative AI-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with physics-based domain knowledge. Specifically, we first incorporate a set of loss functions into our LDM that accurately capture the physical properties of the CT data acquisition process. We demonstrate that addition of these loss functions aids in stable training of the autoencoder in the LDM and improves its accuracy. The autoencoder and the Diffusion model of the LDM is trained with real-world experimental data. Collecting real world experimental data from Synchrotron beamlines is often time-consuming and challenging. We demonstrate that the autoencoder trained with a combination of real world experimental data and phantom features also performs comparable to the autoencoder trained with real world data. Second, we introduce a novel image blending method to combine the LDM\u2019s generated output with the original, extremely sparse sinogram data. Since our model integrates physics-guided loss functions focused on CT data acquisition, it simplifies the creation of downstream tasks and facilitates the adaptation of new features from different experiments. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates improvements of upto 23.5 % in SSIM for sinogram quality and 13.8 % for reconstructed image quality compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

                "value": "This paper presents a novel foundation model for sinogram inpainting based on the latent diffusion model (LDM). By considering certain physical characteristics of CT acquisition and sinograms, they designed an innovative physics-informed loss function that significantly enhances the autoencoder's training performance. Additionally, they introduced a sinogram blending technique that balances content and style perception to improve the synthesis quality between predicted and real sinograms. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in sinogram inpainting, highlighting its potential as a foundational model for CT applications."

                "value": "- The structure of this paper is highly disorganized. For instance, in lines 171\u2013176, after introducing various works on sinogram inpainting, the authors abruptly shift to discussing image blending, which may confuse readers. Furthermore, the authors seem unfamiliar with the proper use of `\\citet` and `\\citep` commands, as nearly all citations fail to meet academic writing standards, particularly in Section 2, where incorrect citation formatting severely disrupts the reading experience. In Section 4.4, almost all citations are wrong, with many references not corresponding to their intended sources. The authors should thoroughly review and correct all citations with careful attention to detail.\n- Figure 9 is severely blurred, making it difficult to discern the comparative effectiveness of the proposed method against other approaches. Additionally, the paper lacks a quantitative performance comparison with the baseline methods. Although the primary task is sinogram inpainting, in practical applications, the focus is ultimately on the quality of the final CT images reconstructed from the inpainted sinograms. This aspect is missing from the current work. The authors should consider including both quantitative and qualitative results of the CT images reconstructed from sinograms completed using the proposed method."

A review of deep learning ct reconstruction from incomplete projection data. IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences, 2023.\n\n2.     The so-called \u201cnovel blending algorithm\u201d proposed in this paper is, in fact, a common practice in CT reconstruction from incomplete measurements.\n\n3.     The term \u201crealistic simulated data\u201d raises ambiguity regarding the authenticity of the experimental data; it is unclear whether the data are from real experiments or simulations. Although the paper emphasizes the importance of physics-based loss functions, there is no detailed description of imaging parameters. Additionally, the use of \u201cre-project\u201d suggests that the projection data may not be genuine, but rather re-generated, which further questions the authenticity of the data used.\n\n4.     Since the method uses FBP with a reconstruction loss, why not present the reconstructed CT images? This would provide a more intuitive understanding of the results.\n\n5.     The resolution of Figure 9 is too low, making it difficult to read the results.\n\n6.     The paper involves many hyperparameters but lacks any analysis or justification regarding their selection. Given the importance of these parameters to the model\u2019s performance, a sensitivity analysis or at least a discussion on hyperparameter tuning would enhance the reliability and reproducibility of the results."
