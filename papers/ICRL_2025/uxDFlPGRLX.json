    "title": "FlowDec: A flow-based full-band general audio codec with high perceptual quality",
    "abstract": "We propose FlowDec, a neural full-band audio codec for general audio sampled at 48 kHz that combines non-adversarial codec training with a stochastic postfilter based on a novel conditional flow matching method. Compared to the prior work ScoreDec which is based on score matching, we generalize from speech to general audio and move from 24 kbit/s to as low as 4 kbit/s, while improving output quality and reducing the required postfilter DNN evaluations from 60 to 6 without any fine-tuning or distillation techniques. We provide theoretical insights and geometric intuitions for our approach in comparison to ScoreDec as well as another recent work that uses flow matching, and conduct ablation studies on our proposed components. We show that FlowDec is a competitive alternative to the recent GAN-dominated stream of neural codecs, achieving FAD scores better than those of the established GAN-based codec DAC and listening test scores that are on par, and producing qualitatively more natural reconstructions for speech and harmonic structures in music.",

FlowDec modifies the DAC audio codec with different loss functions, the stochastic post-filter, and frequency-dependent noise. Evaluations demonstrate strong improvements over prior post-filter and diffusion-based methods, but only small improvements over DAC."

Some of the contributions currently listed seem minor, or are a side effect of another contribution.\n\nA primary issue with the proposed system is RTF. The logical alternative (DAC) is still orders of magnitude faster. I do still think this is an important paper in helping close the gap.\n\nA minor note, but a 44.1 kHz sample rate is sufficient to prevent audible aliasing above 20 kHz. The other rationales given for using 48 kHz over 44.1 kHz are convincing enough for me."

It is difficult to judge the results otherwise, and the MUSHRA test (unlike an AB or ABX test) doesn't provide sufficient granularity to discern statistical significance between, e.g., FlowDec and DAC."

                "value": "The paper introduces FlowDec as a codec, but its primary focus seems to be a flow-based postfilter that enhances outputs from an *underlying* codec. The main weakness of this paper is the decision not to explore a GAN-based codec combined with the proposed postfilter. The paper argues against adversarial training in Section 3.3, stating that the \u201cgenerated phase may be very different from the original phase.\u201d However, FlowDec itself doesn't seem to preserve phase. Results presented in Section 5.1 show that FlowDec performs worse than GAN-based codecs in terms of SI-SDR and fwSSNR, which are sensitive to phase shifts. This might still be acceptable for a low-bitrate codec, particularly if perceptual quality is prioritized. However, the paper should more clearly justify why a GAN isn't used as the underlying codec. A GAN-based codec with a flow-based postfilter might not only reduce coding artifacts but also achieve higher reconstruction metrics. This would call into question the rationale behind the proposed non-adversarial DAC (NDAC) model. Overall, the distinction between FlowDec as a novel audio codec and its role as an enhancement tool for *any* audio codec could be clarified."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Could the authors clarify the main purpose of FlowDec? Why is it presented as a standalone codec rather than positioning the postfilter as an enhancement tool?\n2. What is the rationale for choosing to enhance only outputs from a non-adversarial codec instead of using GAN output as the initial estimate for FlowDec's postfilter? Could the authors specify what benefits NDAC offers over DAC in this proposed two-stage setup?\n3. The STFT settings seem unconventional. A 1534-point FFT would definitely be slower than a 1536-point FFT due to FFT efficiency with highly composite sizes. I assume the goal is to get exactly 768 frequency bins, but why not just use a 1536-point FFT with 769 bins? Overall, this may be negligible given the slower inference, but I'm curious about the tradeoff here."
