    "title": "BoneMet: An Open Large-Scale Multi-Modal Murine Dataset for Breast Tumor Bone Metastasis Diagnosis and Prognosis",
    "abstract": "Breast tumor bone metastasis (BTBM) affects women\u2019s health globally, calling for the development of effective solutions for its diagnosis and prognosis. While the deep learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, their applicability to managing BTBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open, large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical resource specifically targeting BTBM for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment management. It offers over 50 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative analysis), collected from thousands of mice spanning from 2019 to 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. Thanks to its extensive data samples and our tireless efforts of image processing, organization and data labeling, BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models for managing BTBM diseases, which have been validated by our extensive experiments via various deep learning solutions. To facilitate its easy access and wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs that enable researchers to (i)flexibly process and download the BoneMet data filtered by specific time frames;and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for precise BTBM diagnosis and prognosis. The BoneMet dataset is officially available on Hugging Face Datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoneMet/BoneMet. The BoneMet package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/BoneMet. Code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/BoneMet/BoneMet.",

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Authors describe that Seg-CT and Recon-CT are independent. What is the difference between 3D CT scans in Recon-CT and Seg-CT? What is the meaning of the adjective 'segmented'?\n2. Line 341 \"Second, we observe a significant training-test accuracy gap of 20.4% with ViT (w/o STA), indicating a pronounced overfitting issue inherent to the ViT architecture.\"\nI think ViT, as a visual backbone network, is less overfitting compared to other structures such as CNN. In addition, is the decrease in accuracy necessarily overfitting?\n3. Section 3.1, the purpose and analysis of experiments is confusing. Why comparing two ViT models could demonstrate the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset to manage BTBM disease? What is the relation between the effectiveness of\nSTA and the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset? All subsections 3.2-4 have similar questions.\n4. The experiment did not report data partitioning.\n5. Table 2 reported metrics on the training and testing data. Is there any evaluation/dev data?\n6. The experiment reported many indicator values, but their actual clinical significance has not been evaluated. For example, what are the Precision/Recall/F1-Score/Accuracy of clinical experts on the BTBM diagnosis? Besides, the 3D-GAN, T-VAE, and ST-VAE methods achieve SSIM values of 0.767, 0.817, and 0.860. So, what role can they play in clinical practice?\n7. The authors used many existing softwares as the processing tools to generate the sub-datasets of BoneMet. Please provide the corresponding reference and specify whether it is free of charge or not. Also, please accurately explain in which case the datasets are processed by the Seg-API, Regist-API and RoI-API that were developed by the authors.\n8. Are Pre-Op and Post-Op refer to pre-operation and post-operation? Please give the full spelling.\n9. For RoI-CT, the tibiae ROI is assigned with different pixel values. As shown in Figure 4, for each CT example, is the processed CT image contains the values of 180, 240, 60 and 0 only? If yes, the original CT turns to a segmentation mask instead, and lots of information would be lost.\n10. In the whole preparation procedure, it seems that the manual annotation of the organs or tumors is not involved, except for the manual cropping of fibular by  CTAn\u00ae. How could we ensure the effectiveness of the existing software?\n11. In Table 1, the column \"Spatial Resolution\" might be accurately filled out as most of them indicate the organs. Please revise it.\n12. Some details about the BoneMet dataset are missing. For instance, the number of mice is not introduced. Besides, in Table 1, the images/records are classified into two categories, i.e., positive and negative. Is the label assigned at the slice level or animal level? Besides, we noticed that the numbers of Seg-CT are larger than those of Recon-CT, which makes it confusing, as the Seg-CT is obtained from Recon-CT.\n13. I also have concerns about the MiceMediRec dataset. It mainly consists of the medical record and quantitative analysis results of 3D CT images, simulation and mechanical testing. The authors list only a part of the features in Table S2 in the supplementary file. However, all feature should be provided. The off-the-shelf software, such as CTAn\u00ae, was used to generate the quantitative parameters, which took about half an hour for each case of animal. In Section 3.3, the multi-modal prognostic assessment model first leveraged the GAN to produce the CT scan of the future point and use the quantitative data in the MiceMediRec dataset as the ground truth label to validate the predicted reaction force values. However, the details about how to obtain the predicted reaction force values are not clear.\n14. In my opinion, multi-modal learning might refer to a way to integrate the information of multi-source data to build a model. However, the application in Section 3.3 just used CT data as model input. Please consider revising it."
