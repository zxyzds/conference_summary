    "title": "Augmented Flow Matching via Variance Reduction with Auxiliary Variables",
    "abstract": "Flow matching is a simulation-free approach that scalably generates an ODE, in which its path traverses between two different distributions. However, conventional flow matching relies on the training pairs drawn independently, inducing high variance that might slow down training process and degrade the performance upon training. To mitigate this, we propose augmented flow matching, a simple yet efficient framework that can be ubiquitously applied to flow matching with slight modification to the models. We first find that when some auxiliary variables that are correlated to the training data, then they contribute on variance reduction of the flow matching loss estimation, when used together with the training data pair. With this observation, we construct auxiliary variables that are correlated to the training pair, which is obtained by simple and effective linear operation from the input data. Finally, we show that with this simple modification on the training phase, we achieve the improved model flexibility and performance when the ODE is applied on the learned model.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel method to reduce the variance of flow-matching loss in ODE-based generative models. The authors show both theoretically and empirically that adding  auxiliary variables that are correlated to the training data reduces the variance of the target. Based on this, they propose to construct the auxiliary variables through a random projection of the training data. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of their proposed method."

The augmented variables change the reference probability path, and make it so the variance of the conditional estimator (eq 6) is lower (prop 1): my understanding here is that there are not as many overlapping paths in the augmented space. Algorithm 1 shows the proposed way of augmenting the path, and S3.3 discusses some design choices on how to choose the path. The experimental results apply this to synthetic 2D flows (S5.1), CIFAR-10 generation (S5.2), and embryonic cell evolution (S5.3)"

                "value": "While I do agree with the motivation for the paper, I have marked it for a strong reject because I feel that the experimental results are insufficient in the current form. I am very open to discussing these through the rest of the review period.\n\n1. My biggest concern is that the experimental results do not improve upon the best-known flow matching results in any setting, and do not adequately compare to other flow matching variations. This is concerning as the idea and implementation of augmented variables is straightforward and easy to try in every flow matching setting and application. Concretely:\n    + **1a.** In CIFAR-10 modeling: rectified flow reports an FID of 2.58 in comparison to the submitted paper's best FID of ~3.5 --- these comparisons are omitted in the submitted paper. The experimental results of the paper indicate/argue that the augmentations are helpful for lower NFE, so it seems fair to compare to other flow matching modifications that also create straighter paths, such as rectified flows evaluated with the Euler/2nd-order Huen methods, or mini-batch or multisample flow matching.\n    + **1b.** Flows and transport on the embryonic cell evolution on the Waddington OT dataset by Schiebinger et al. (2019) have been extensively studied, and cited almost 1000 times. This dataset/setting is used in Figure 5 and other parts of the submitted paper, but do not compare to or reference any previously published results on this dataset. This makes it extremely difficult to assess the experimental comparison.\n2. I have another minor concern that the augmented variables could hurt the performance by taking away modeling capacity. I believe this is why they carefully select the number of augmenting variables to only be a few, as likely the performance is significantly hurt otherwise, 2) Table 2 stops the NFE at 100 steps for Euler and 60 steps for the 2nd-order Huen. These seem chosen at exactly the NFE where the effect of the flows with the augmented variables disappears, so it's possible the FID is hurt when integrating with a highly accurate ODE solver."

                "value": "W1. While there is no need for a technique to be unnecessarily complicated, and a paper should not be penalized for proposing a simple method, especially when it is effective (there is elegance and robustness in simplicity), the technical contribution of the paper is limited. There are several important issues that are not resolved. Perhaps most importantly, the experimental results clearly indicate the importance of the choice of the augmentation dimension and the number of function evaluations. The proposed technique even makes things worse (at a slightly higher computational and memory cost) if there is not a judicious selections. The paper would be considerably stronger if it investigated how to choose these parameters and proposed an effective strategy. \n\nW2. The experiments provide some support for the claim that the proposed method leads to improved performance, but the experimental analysis is not convincing or thorough. The paper does not report any measure of the variability in the experiments. It is not clear to me if these are the results from a single run or the average over multiple runs. There is no attempt at statistical significance testing to establish that the performance differences are meaningful. This is a particular concern when there is inconsistent behaviour. For example, in Table 2 Heun, the performance for AugDim=3 is consistently worse for all NFE than both AugDim=2 and AugDim=4. This doesn\u2019t really make sense. It raises concerns about the consistency of the results and the experimental assessment. \n\nW3. The paper claims that \u201cThis approach can be plugged-in to other existing training methods that enhances efficiency, such as optimal transport or curvature-minimizing approach.\u201d While it may be true that it can be combined with these approaches, the paper provides no evidence that the combination is useful. In general, the paper does not compare experimentally to any other methods that are designed to improve the performance of flow matching beyond basic independent sampling. It would at least be useful to understand whether the technique, when employed on CIFAR-10, for example, outperforms or approaches the performance of some of the much more computationally burdensome strategies. For example, how does it compare to ReFlow?\n\nW4. The discussion for the cell evolution experiment could be improved. Qualitatively, the distributions obtained using the augmented flow matching approach are better, but they are still very different from the original. The discussion is limited to a statement that the proposed approach leads to a collection of samples that \u201cbetter follows the distribution of true points\u201d. Are they good enough? How can one tell?"

If so, please characterize the variability in performance. Please conduct statistical significance tests where appropriate to establish that there is a meaningful difference between the baseline and the proposed approach. \n\nQ3. Please comment on other improvement approaches. (i) Please compare the achieved performance to the previous methods (with the understanding that they are much more computationally heavy); and (ii) please explain whether there is evidence that the adoption of the proposed method in combination with these improvement strategies leads to improvement. If not, then the claim in the paper should be adjusted to acknowledge that there is potential, but it is not clear yet if the combination is useful. This avenue is particularly intriguing for me, since there have been recent proposals for simplified versions of rectified flow matching, for example, which might be computationally reasonable while retaining effectiveness. If the proposed strategy leads to further improvement, then this would be most welcome. \n\nQ4. Please provide a more detailed discussion of the cell evolution experiment. Why does the Wasserstein distance increase as NFE increases in Figure 5? This behaviour doesn\u2019t appear to be evident for CIFAR-10, where the metrics are effectively monotonically decreasing with NFE."
