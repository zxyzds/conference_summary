    "title": "A Hybrid Simulation of DNN-based Gray Box Models",
    "abstract": "Simulation is vital for scientific and engineering disciplines, as it enables the prediction and design of physical systems. However, the computational challenges inherent to large-scale simulations often arise from complex device models featuring high degrees of nonlinearities or hidden physical behaviors not captured by first principles. Gray-box models that combine deep neural networks (DNNs) with physics-based models have been proposed to address the computational challenges in modeling complex physical systems. A well-crafted gray box model capitalizes on the interpretability and accuracy of a physical model while incorporating deep neural networks to capture hidden physical behaviors and mitigate computational load associated with highly nonlinear components. Previously, gray box models have been constructed by defining an explicit combination of physics-based and black-box models to represent the behavior of sub-systems; however this alone cannot represent the coupled interactions that define the behavior of the entire physical system. We, therefore, explore an implicit gray box model, where both DNNs (trained on measurement and simulated data) and physical equations share a common set of state-variables. While this approach captures coupled interactions at the boundary of data-driven and physics-based models, simulating the implicit gray box model remains an open-ended problem. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid simulation that directly integrates DNNs into the numerical solvers of simulation engines to fully simulate implicit gray box models of large physical systems. This is accomplished by backpropagating through the DNN to calculate specific Jacobian values during each iteration of the numerical method. The hybrid simulation of implicit gray-box models improves the accuracy and runtime compared to full physics-based simulation and enables reusable DNN models with lower data requirements for training. For demonstration, we explore the advantages of this approach as compared to physics-based, black box, and other gray box methods for simulating the steady-state and electromagnetic transient behavior of power systems.",

The physical equation calculates its own value as it is supposed to be the complete picture of the device/system, and the neural network equation also calculates its own value and is supposed to be a complete picture of the device/system. Previous work by Menesklou et al., \"Grey box modeling of decanter centrifuges by coupling a numerical process model with a neural network,\" as a reference in this paper, utilized a summation because the neural network part provides a correction to the physics-based model. The authors need to explain clearly why the two values are being summed up if no error correction is being made. \n\n2. The example used in \"5.1 VALIDATING JACOBIAN ELEMENTS OF THE IMPLICIT DNN-BASED GRAY BOX MODELS\" looks like a simple sinusoidal. A neural network learning the sinusoidal function does not seem very impressive. A more complicated system should be chosen to convince me. \n\n3. The advantages of the methods are not convincing.
