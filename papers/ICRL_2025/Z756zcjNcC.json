    "title": "Denoising Diffusion Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "A common theme across multiple disciplines of science is to understand the underlying dependencies between variables from observational data. Such dependencies are often modeled as Bayesian Network (BNs), which by definition are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Recent advancements, such as NOTEARS and DAG-GNN, have focused on formulating continuous DAG constraints and learning DAGs via continuous optimization. However, these methods often have scalability issues and face challenges when applied to real world data. In this paper, we propose Denoising Diffusion Causal Discovery (DDCD), a new learning framework that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for causal structural learning. Using the denoising objective, our method allows the model to explore a wider range of noise in the data and effectively captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. It also has reduced complexity and is more suitable for inference of larger networks. To accommodate potential feedback loops in biological networks, we propose a k-hop DAG constraint. Additionally, we suggest using fixed-size bootstrap sampling to ensure similar training performance across varying dataset sizes. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that DDCD achieves consistent competitive performance compared to existing methods while noticeably reducing computation time.  We also show that DDCD can generate trustworthy networks from real-world datasets.",

                "value": "This paper studies the causal discovery problem by reformulating it into a denoising diffusion process problem. It proposes three frameworks, the linear model, the nonlinear model, and the smooth model. Under the linear model, the authors show the equivalence of the denoising objective to the objective of the structural equation model. Furthermore, the author proposes the k-hop DAG constraints to enforce DAG structures within k-hops of the nodes. This method speeds up the computation by only checking the DAG of local neighbors. The paper compares the proposed method with several baselines including DAGs and the proposed method shows improvement in SHD score."

It seems that the major trick that can make the estimation procedure scalable is the k-hop DAG constraint, which reduces the algorithm's runtime. However, under the k-hop framework, the DAG structure is no longer guaranteed. It is not clear if a graph with cycles can be uniquely identified under this framework."

It is not clear why Equation (13)-(14) is equivalent to Equation (4), as $Y$ has an additional term $E_1$.\n\nc. In the experiment section, it states that the number of nodes ranging from 20 to 5000 are tested, but only results of 20 and 100 are reported. How does the method perform when the number of nodes increases beyond 100?'\n\nd. The first term of  Equation (16) is \n$\\|(X\u2212f_2(f_1(X)W))+(Y_t\u2212Y_tW)\u2212diag(\\sqrt{1\u2212\\bar\\alpha_t})Z(I\u2212W)\\|_F^2$. I am a bit confused here.

First, it demonstrates that the objective function of a linear Structural Equation Model (SEM) can be transformed into the form of a denoising diffusion model, thereby enabling causal discovery using this methodology. Next, the paper introduces an approach to nonlinear causal discovery by applying the denoising diffusion framework to intermediate variables that are nonlinearly transformed from the original variables. To address the issue of variable scale adjustment, the authors propose a method that smooths the process using the activation function of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Additionally, they incorporate a modified version of the NOTEARS constraint - relaxed to a k-hop condition - into the denoising diffusion process, aiming to better approximate a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Through experiments with synthetic data, the method demonstrates the ability to estimate causal graphs with high accuracy and efficient computation, outperforming traditional causal discovery methods that handle a large number of variables. The approach is further validated with real-world data, showing that it produces results consistent with domain knowledge."

However, there is room for improvement in the evaluation of the method. The most significant issue lies in the assessment of the DAG property. Since the proposed method introduces a relaxed k-hop DAG constraint rather than enforcing a strict DAG structure, a more careful evaluation is needed to understand how this relaxation impacts the DAG nature of the estimated causal graph. While the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) between the estimated graph and the ground truth DAG is provided, this metric alone is insufficient to assess how well the DAG constraint is being maintained (or violated). Evaluating the number of loops that occur, for example, could provide more insight. Additionally, allowing loops might enable better handling of feedback loops in real-world data, so evaluating the DAG property in this context is crucial. Including such evaluations could greatly enhance the persuasiveness of the paper."
