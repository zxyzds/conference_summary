    "title": "GRACE: Towards Realistic Multimodal Single-Cell Data Matching",
    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics technologies (e.g., scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data) have provided more comprehensive insights for understanding cellular conditions and activities in recent years. However, multimodal representation learning for omics data remains a challenging problem due to heterogeneous relationships and label scarcity in reality. In this work, we propose a novel approach named Geometric Relation Exploration with Cross-modal Supervision (GRACE) for realistic multimodal single-cell matching. In particular, we map both multimodal data into a shared embedding space by maximizing the log-likelihood of ZINB distributions. To reduce the semantic gap between multimodal data, we construct a geometric graph using mutual nearest neighbors to indicate cross-modal relations between samples for distribution alignment. Furthermore, to extract most pairwise information, we explore high-order relations in the geometric graph, which would be incorporated into a meta-learning paradigm for robust optimization. In addition, to further mitigate label scarcity, we introduce a non-parametric way to generate label vectors for unlabeled data for cross-modal supervision across different modalities. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed GRACE compared to various baselines. In general, compared to the second-best method, GRACE exhibits an average performance improvement of 6.71% and 14.17% for the R2A task and A2R task, respectively.",

In addition, the motivations of some design are not very convincing, such as the usage of ZINB distribution and consistency learning.\n3. There are several hyperparameters in the propsoed method, making the method less practical in the real-world senarios."

                "value": "1. Is the ZINB modeling suitable for scATAC-seq data? Could you provide any evidence that scATAC-seq data fits the ZINB distribution?\n2. What is the difference between Eq. 5 and commonly used classification cross-entropy? Can authors provide some explanations and ablation studies on that?\n3. Is the problem setting \"realistic\" as the authors claimed in the paper title? In what scenarios would we have part of annotated scRNA-seq data and part of annotated scATAC-seq data? In most cases, it seems more likely to have labeled scRNA-seq data and unlabelled scATAC-seq data. The setting in the evaluations seems to be even stranger. In real-world applications, when would we have and only have 50 to 200 labels?\n4. The experimental comparisons are not fair. The proposed method requires paired multi-omics data as the input, in which the pairing information is a strong prior. In contrast, several baseline methods do not require the pairing information. The advantage of the proposed method could be attributed to the additional pairing and label information.\n5. I note that Table 5 provides a more realistic data integration problem setting. However, the performance improvements of the proposed method are marginal, which limits the strength and significance of this work.\n6. What is the time complexity of the proposed method? Does it scale to large datasets, given that it requires building the neighborhood graph?\n7. I suggest the authors include baseline methods such as GLUE and MOFA+ in Table 1. The classification results could be obtained by using KNN on the integrated embeddings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. GRACE employs a non-parametric strategy to generate label distributions for unlabeled cell data. This is achieved by comparing the representations of unlabeled cells with support representations to provide guidance signals for cross-modal consistency. However, the quality of these support representations can significantly impact the label generation process for unlabeled samples, thereby affecting the model's final performance. If the distribution of the data used to construct the support representations is not comprehensive enough to cover all datasets, it may lead to inaccurate reconstruction of the label distributions for unlabeled samples, which in turn affects the quality of the representations learned by the model. In such cases, the model's performance may suffer as it relies on these potentially inaccurate label distributions for cross-modal consistency learning. Therefore, the paper should provide more discussion and analysis regarding this issue. Additionally, it is recommended to cite more literature related to this problem.\n\n2. It is suggested to test performance using labeled data sampled from different subsets of cell types, or to analyze how performance varies with different sizes of labeled datasets.\n\n3. The related work section lacks a thorough introduction to the current problem, and does not sufficiently analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the model structure presented in this paper for solving the current problem, i.e., there is a lack of necessary motivation.\n\n4. The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the GRACE method in detail (parameters, FLOPS), which could pose challenges for laboratories or research environments with limited resources. Please provide specific detailed information:\n(1) The number of parameters in their model compared to baseline methods\n(2) Training and inference times on standard hardware\n(3) Memory requirements for different dataset sizes\n(4) Any analysis of how computational requirements scale with dataset size or number of cell types This would help readers assess the practical applicability of the method.\n\n5. Although sensitivity analysis of the parameters has been conducted, the selection of optimal parameters for new datasets remains an open question. Please explain whether any automatic parameter tuning methods have been explored, or if a guide can be provided for selecting parameters based on the characteristics of the dataset. Additionally, please discuss the performance stability across a broader range of parameter values."
