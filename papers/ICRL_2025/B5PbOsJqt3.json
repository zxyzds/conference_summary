    "title": "TopoGaussian: Inferring Internal Topology Structures from Visual Clues",
    "abstract": "We present TopoGaussian, a particle-based holistic pipeline for inferring the interior structure of an opaque object with easily accessible photos and videos as input. Traditional mesh-based approaches require tedious mesh filling and fixing process with high error rate, while output rough boundary surface. Our pipeline combines Gaussian splatting with a novel particle-based differentiable simulator for objects, without interference with mesh. Based on the gradients from this simulator, we provides flexible choice of topology representation for optimization, including particle, neural implicit surface, and quadratic surface. The resultant pipeline supports modeling, simulation, and optimization of the interior geometry in a heterogeneous object on a unified point-cloud representation. We present a synthetic dataset, and showcase the results of our pipeline on it. Moreover, we perform experiments on four real-world tasks, and further 3D print the output to validate the efficacy of our methods. Compared with existing mesh-based method, our pipeline is 5.26 times faster, with 2.33 times quality of reconstructed boundary in average. These results highlight the potential of our pipeline in 3D-vision, soft-robotics, and manufacturing applications.",

                "value": "The authors present a holistic approach to estimating the internal topology of objects from images. The work relies on the use of a particle-based differentiable simulator to estimate probable internal topology directly from the seen motion of an object. By this approach, the author is able to generate even real-world 3D printed versions with reasonable structure directly from a small video sequence."

While the idea of reconstruction of internal topologies is not novel to the best of my knowledge, I have not seen much work trying to solve this for 3D Gaussian Splatting or NeRF-based approaches.\nThe work itself is decently written and shows a great evaluation to validate the quality of their methodology.\nThe authors can propose a holistic pipeline that should make their work easily usable for users, with the authors giving a significant amount of design possibilities.\nIn general, I am more than in favor of this work's results and core concept being interesting."

While still quite understandable, this work packs a significant amount of results, ideas, and concepts from many different fields.\nAs such, while many parts of the simulation (core contribution) have been well explained, much information regarding the volumetric representation is missing. As such, to improve the work (and make it complete), I would suggest the author add more information in the appendix.\nAnother larger issue is the motivation. While in Computer Graphics/Computer Vision, the challenge of estimating internal topologies is quite interesting, the estimation part might be a larger issue for practical, real-world use cases. In many real-world applications that rely on internal topologies, it is quite important that exact information is given, as this cannot assured by your model. I am still quite unsure when this work will be usable in real-world applications."

But to enhance my understanding, why do we require the internal topology to be known for this? Shouldn't having the surface not be enough?\n- Please fix the typo in line 175 \"point clout\"\n- Please keep writing style consistent for example, line 234, \"point-cloud\"\n- Would it be possible again to summarize for me what actually is the main goal and main application of this work?\n- Not so much a question but rather a comment regarding Abstract Style (improvement/suggestion): Having this kind of structure usually improves understandability and readability: 1. What is the problem and why is it important? 2. What are the limitations of existing solutions? 3. What are the advantages of the proposed approach? 4. How does it work? 5. Summary of results"

                "value": "The reviewer appreciates the authors' effort in building a particle-based pipeline to find a physically plausible internal topology structure. As the authors have also mentioned in the paper, this task is relatively new, and there are fewer baselines to compare with (at least other baselines do not use point-based representation). I have several concerns about the measuring metrics and their validation to support the claims from the authors:\n\n1. Optimization Loss: This measures the difference between simulated motion and reference motion, and it directly indicates whether the internal topology structure is physically plausible. However, in Figure 3, the current method does not achieve the lowest loss among baselines in multiple test samples.\n2. Comparison Implementation: When exporting the mesh from other baselines and chaining it into the rest of the pipeline in this paper, how can the mesh-based representation be made compatible with the rest of the system that is particle-based?\n3. Time / Smoothness: It is unclear whether this improvement comes from the GS representation itself or from the authors' method. The reviewer encourages the authors to elaborate more on this or provide ablation studies to explain that the improvement comes from the proposed method itself.\n4. Inner Structure: Can the authors provide the reference ground truth for the inner structures when making comparisons with other baselines? The reviewer understands that, in practice, the inner structures are hard to acquire, but in synthetic data, it is practical to obtain the ground truth of inner structures.\n\nOther question:\n\nHow is the decision variable applied to the point cloud representation to obtain a continuous indicator function from the point cloud?

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Evaluation Limitation: The method optimizes the interior structure based on a single motion, which may lead to overfitting and an inaccurate reconstruction of the true internal structure. Since ground truth data for internal topology is unavailable, it is difficult to verify if the inferred structure is correct or merely adapted to the given motion. Although the authors acknowledge this limitation and propose alternative metrics, these may not fully reflect the true structure. To strengthen the evaluation, the authors could consider obtaining ground truth through simulation (maybe with physics simulation) or testing the inferred structure on new motion videos as a test set. If the predicted structure is accurate, it should exhibit consistent behavior across these unseen motions, providing stronger validation.\n2. Potential Overfitting to Single Motion: The current approach optimizes the internal structure based on a single motion video, which may lead to overfitting and limit the model\u2019s generalization capability. To improve the robustness and accuracy of the inferred structure, the authors could consider optimizing based on multiple motion videos. By incorporating a variety of motions, the resulting model may better capture the true internal structure and provide more reliable and generalizable results.\n3. Limitation to Simple Material Compositions: The current framework supports only single-object, dual-material compositions, which may limit applications involving complex, heterogeneous materials or multi-object interactions. Future work could focus on extending support to more intricate material compositions."
