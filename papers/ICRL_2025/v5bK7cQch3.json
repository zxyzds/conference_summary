    "title": "Learning 3D Medical Image Models From Brain Functional Connectivity Network Supervision For Mental Disorder Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "For mental disorder diagnosis, most previous works are task-specific and focus primarily on functional connectivity network (FCN) derived from functional MRI (fMRI) data. However, the high cost of fMRI acquisition limits its practicality in real-world clinical settings. Meanwhile, the more easily obtainable 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, which captures brain anatomy, is ofen overlooked in standard diagnostic processes of mental disorders.\nTo address these two issues, we propose CINP (Contrastive Image-Network Pre-training), a framework that employs contrastive learning between 3D T1w MRI and FCNs. CINP aims to learn a joint latent semantic space that integrates complementary information from both functional and structural perspective. During pre-training, we incorporate masked image modeling loss and network-image matching loss to enhance visual representation learning and modality alignment.\nFurthermore, thanks to contrastive pre-training which facilitates knowledge transfer from FCN to T1w MRI, we introduce network prompting. This protocol leverages 3D T1w MRI from suspected patients and FCNs from confirmed patients for differential diagnosis of mental disorders.  \nExtensive experiments across three mental disorder diagnosis tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of CINP, using both linear probing and network prompting, compared with FCN-based methods and self-supervised pre-training methods.\nThese results highlight the potential of CINP to enhance diagnostic processes with the aid of 3D T1w MRI in real-world clinical scenario.",

The approach of cross-modal contrastive learning is well-founded and offers a solid framework for using information from both modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy while also enabling retrieval/diagnosis when one of the modalities is missing.\u2028\n2. The three objective functions are well-described, and the authors provide detailed ablation studies, which contribute to a better understanding of their impact on model performance.\u2028\n3. The clear delineation between pretraining and evaluation sets facilitates relatively fair comparisons across out-of-domain datasets."

For instance, the experimental setup for network prompting is somewhat challenging to follow, as detailed in my questions below.\u2028\n2. The authors hypothesize that the \u201cCINP\u201d model has potential for improvement through fine-tuning; it would be better to directly include corresponding results in the tables for a more comprehensive understanding.\u2028\n3. The comparisons are primarily between CINP and single-modality models (sMRI or FCN). There is a lack of discussion and direct comparisons with existing multi-modal methods for mental health diagnosis, both in linear probing and fine-tuning contexts. At least, some consensus on FCN and SSP-based model predictions would allow for fairer comparisons.\u2028\n4. Although several metrics are presented, the authors did not discuss in detail the differences, especially when two metrics offer contrasting results.\u2028\n5. The authors did show the advantages of pretraining over simply fine-tuning a model directly on the evaluation dataset that utilizes both modalities as input. This is an important aspect to demonstrate the value of pretraining. Further improvements could include testing in a low-data regime to see if pretraining can reduce data requirements for subsequent fine-tuning.\u2028\n6. While improvements are shown, the absolute values of metrics appear low for potential clinical applications. Providing context on results from the literature for the same task or similar datasets would help readers unfamiliar with this specific field better interpret the model's performance."

Regarding network prompting, what is meant by partitioning all samples into 5/10 subsets? What is the purpose of this partitioning? Additionally, could the authors clarify why they chose to use 10% or 50% of the data? Is this to assess retrieval performance in a low-data regime? It would also be helpful to explain why the results are better when using 10% of the training data compared to using 100%.Also, the number 29.33% seems inconsistent with the figures in Table 3."

The paper's technical contributions appear limited, as it mainly combines existing methods like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders (MAE) without significant innovation in methodology. The CINP framework may be seen as a straightforward integration of known techniques rather than a novel approach.\n2. There is still room for performance improvement. The performance of CINP on the ABIDE dataset is noticeably lower than that of the baselines, as indicated in Table 2. This suggests that the framework may not be fully optimized or may have limitations, and further improvements are needed to make it competitive across all datasets.\n3. The assumption that sMRI and fMRI features can be effectively aligned using contrastive learning lacks theoretical or empirical support from a neuroimaging or neuroscience perspective. This forced alignment may overlook important modality-specific differences, making the approach less effective for capturing unique structural-functional relationships in brain data. (See my questions below.)"

            "questions": {
                "value": "My main concern is with the rationale behind using contrastive loss in CINP to model sMRI and fMRI representations. Based on my knowledge, there is a clear distinction between neuroimaging and image-text domains. In the image-text domain, it makes sense to maximize the differences between different categories while minimizing the differences within the same category. For instance, aligning a cat\u2019s textual description with its image, while creating a contrast with dog-related text and images, is logical. However, in neuroimaging studies, why should we align sMRI and fMRI feature representations in this way? And why should we increase inter-subject differences?\n\nI also note that a healthy cohort was used for CINP\u2019s pre-training. The differences within a healthy population do not fall into distinct categorical boundaries, so it is unclear what meaningful patterns are learned by maximizing inter-subject representation differences. Brain imaging features of healthy individuals are generally quite similar in terms of overall structure and function. By maximizing these differences within healthy individuals, the model may pick up biologically insignificant or irrelevant details, diverting its focus from core features. Such differences are more likely to be noise than meaningful information. In contrastive learning, distinct category boundaries are typically required to generate positive and negative samples, but healthy individuals do not naturally fall into clear categories, making the construction of inter-subject contrasts somewhat artificial. \n\nAdditionally, enforcing a \u201cstrict alignment\u201d between sMRI and fMRI features may lack generalizability. For mental disorders, patients do not always exhibit abnormalities in both sMRI and fMRI simultaneously. For example, a patient might have a normal gray matter thickness in the prefrontal cortex as shown by sMRI, yet fMRI may reveal weakened functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and other regions (such as the parietal lobe or hippocampus). In such cases, a \u201cstrict alignment\u201c seems less appropriate. Similarly, even among healthy individuals, while there may be some correlation between gray matter thickness and functional connectivity, it is not necessarily consistent. Forcing alignment within a healthy cohort may lead the model to mistakenly assume a strong correlation between structural and functional features, thereby overlooking the natural variability and dynamic nature of functional connectivity. \n\nI look forward to seeing the authors' response and would consider raising my score if they can adequately address my concerns."
