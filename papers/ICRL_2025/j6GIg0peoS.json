    "title": "GLANCE: Global Actions in a Nutshell for Counterfactual Explainability",
    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of machine learning systems in critical real-world decision-making applications has highlighted the urgent need for counterfactual explainability methods that operate effectively. Global counterfactual explanations, expressed as actions to offer recourse, aim to provide succinct explanations and insights applicable to large population subgroups. Effectiveness is measured by the fraction of the population that is provided recourse, ensuring that the actions benefit as many individuals as possible. Keeping the cost of actions low ensures the proposed recourse actions remain practical and actionable. Limiting the number of actions that provide global counterfactuals is essential to maximize interpretability. The primary challenge, therefore, is balancing these trade-offs\u2014maximizing effectiveness, minimizing cost, while maintaining a small number of actions. We introduce GLANCE, a versatile and adaptive framework, comprising two algorithms, that allows the careful balancing of the trade-offs among the three key objectives, with the size objective functioning as a tunable parameter to keep the actions few and easy to interpret. C-GLANCE employs a clustering approach that considers both the feature space and the space of counterfactual actions, thereby accounting for the distribution of points in a way that aligns with the structure of the model. T-GLANCE provides additional features to enhance flexibility. It employs a tree-based approach, that allows users to specify split features, to build a decision tree with a single counterfactual action at each node that can be used as a subgroup policy. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method consistently shows greater robustness and performance compared to existing methods across various datasets and models.",

The idea of C-Glance is to cluster instances based on their similarity in the feature space or the possible recourse actions. T-Glance is a decision tree based method. For both the introduced techniques, the goal is to maximise effectiveness and minimise the cost, with a small number of actions."

                "value": "This paper introduces new algorithms for finding global counterfactual explanations (GCE) as a small set of actions that can offer recourse to most of the affected population. Any solution to the GCE problem must navigate a tradeoff among the number of actions, the cost of implementing these actions, and the proportion of the population that can effectively use them for recourse. This work specifically examines the case where the number of actions is fixed and explores the tradeoff between cost and effectiveness.\n\nThe paper differentiates between explicit and implicit GCE and proposes two algorithmic frameworks for each. Given that solving GCE with a fixed size is NP-hard in general, the proposed solutions focus on finding efficient GCEs. Empirical evaluations on standard CE datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms existing GCE methods in terms of Pareto optimality and is also computationally efficient."

                "value": "I think the formulation of GCE as a set of actions rather than directions could benefit from further justification. My default understanding of GCE aligns with GLOBE-CE, which focuses on directions for recourse rather than the actions themselves.\n\nThe overall presentation of the paper could be significantly improved. The authors are encouraged to elaborate on the rationale behind certain design choices. I have asked clarification questions in the question section regarding this. In particular, I\u2019m not sure I fully understand Section 4 (T-GLANCE).\n\nI also found it challenging to understand average cost (avc) and the tradeoff with size. If an action is added to the action set C, the recourse cost (rc) for x in the previous C decreases. However, by definition, |X_C| increases, meaning new instances in X_C contribute positively to avc. As a result, it\u2019s unclear how avc behaves as size(C) increases. I expected a definition that clearly illustrates this tradeoff. Given that the results hinge on this concept, further discussion on this choice would be beneficial.\n\nMinor issues: page 3 (computationally efficiently -> efficient), page 5 (min in Problem 1 can be misread as a min of the set), page 8 (can you avoid using red and purple in Table 1? It's hard for me to distinguish them visually)"

                "value": "When calculating the distance between two clusters, why do you focus only on the distance between the average actions in each cluster? I\u2019m curious if the average is the right summary statistic in this context.\n\nAdditionally, when merging clusters, do you retain all of their respective actions? Wouldn\u2019t it be beneficial to prune the action set as part of the merging process?\n\nI\u2019m also unclear on why the evaluations of implicit and explicit GCE are not separated. Further elaboration here could help clarify the distinction between explicit and implicit GCE.\n\nFinally, you might consider using additional metrics beyond Pareto dominance. For instance, Tables 2 and 3 suggest that Fast AReS and GLANCE perform similarly, but Table 1 gives the impression that GLANCE has notably better effectiveness."

One of my concerns is the computation cost of the proposed algorithms. For both algorithms, we need to generate diverse actions for each centroid many times. In particular, Algorithm 2 needs to compute the total effectiveness gain for all the candidates of split conditions in Line 9, which may incur a significantly high computational cost. To compute the total effectiveness gain for one split condition, we have to generate actions for two centroids after splitting and then compute each effectiveness value. In addition, we need to repeat such a heavy procedure for all the candidate split conditions. Although I recognize the average running times of the proposed algorithms in the experiments were less than roughly a few minutes in Appendix F, I am worried about their scalability when we have more candidates of split conditions. \n- W2. Another concern is that this paper includes no theoretical result on the proposed method. I am aware that Theorem 3 in Appendix A shows the hardness of the global counterfactual explanation problem. However, the proposed algorithms are heuristic without theoretical perspectives, and there is no guarantee for the quality of their obtained solution. In addition, there is no analysis of the time complexity of the proposed algorithms as well."

Could you show analyses of the time complexity of the proposed algorithms?\n- Q3 (optional). As far as I remember, AReS and CET have several hyper-parameters. How were these values determined in the experiments?\n- Q4 (optional). As the authors mention in Line 285, we can use any dissimilarity score as two distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ in Algorithm 1. What dissimilarity score could be considered appropriate, especially for $d_2$? Also, how do they affect the solution, i.e., partition and actions?\n- Q5 (optional). Is there any way to compute the total effectiveness gain more efficiently? For example, in the case of the popular CART-like algorithms, we can compute the information gain for each candidate split condition in an amortized constant time if we have sorted training samples by the value of each feature in advance. In a similar way, can we efficiently calculate the total effectiveness gain?"
