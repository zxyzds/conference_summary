    "abstract": "The various interferences in the actual environment make electromagnetic signal recognition challenging, and this topic has extremely important application value.\nIn this paper, a novel interference signal recognition transformer is proposed, named Diffusion SigFormer.\nFirstly, we explored the interference law of electromagnetic signals and designed a signal interference mechanism. \nSecondly, diffusion signal denoising modulewas proposed to denoise the input interference signal. We also use various types of noise to improve its denoising effect on electromagnetic signals.\nThirdly, SigFormer is designed to extract and classify the denoised signal.\nFor the characteristics of electromagnetic signals, SigFormer leverages 1-D Patch Embedding and combines transformer with convolution. \nFinally, we conducted experimental verification on datasets RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b and BT dataset. \nThe experimental results show that the proposed method has excellent anti-interference ability.",

                "value": "1. There are several grammatical errors throughout the manuscript.   \n\nFor example, in the Abstract section, the sentence \"Secondly, diffusion signal denoising module was proposed to denoise the input interference signal.\" should be revised to \"Secondly, a diffusion signal denoising module was proposed to denoise the input interference signal.\"   \n\nIn line 45 of the introduction section, the sentence \"Compared with LB methods, FB methods have stronger robustness and effectiveness, but its recognition performance depends on manually designed features and classifiers.\" should be revised to \"Compared with LB methods, FB methods have stronger robustness and effectiveness, but their recognition performance depends on manually designed features and classifiers.\"  \n\nThere are many similar grammatical errors in the article. The author should check them carefully.  \n\n2. Some sentences in the paper are difficult to read and understand. The author should improve his English writing skills.  \n\nFor example, in the Abstract section, the sentence \"We also use various types of noise to improve its denoising effect on electromagnetic signals.\" This sentence is not very clear. How can noise improve the denoising effect of the signal?  \n\nIn line 81 of the introduction section, the sentence \"In this paper, inspired by the powerful denoising ability of diffusion models and considering the interference of a large number of signals in reality, combined with the powerful temporal processing capability of transformers, we propose a novel signal recognition method based on diffusion model and transformer.\" The sentence is quite long and can be made clearer by breaking it up and improving some phrasing.  \n\n3. Each picture has no caption, which makes it difficult for readers to understand the picture. The method does not present enough details.   \n\nFor example, in Figure 1, it is not clear how different types of noise are added to the original signals. In addition, in the Diffusion signal denoising module, does the diffusion process only go through four steps? Is the ellipsis missing?  \nIn Figure 2, the meaning of some blocks should be explained.   \n   \n4. There are some problems in the picture. In Figure 1, the image and the legend overlap. And the borderlines are very rough. In the Diffusion Process, Some arrows are missing, and the directions are not clear.  \n\n5. Some mathematical symbols are not explained. For example, \"\u03c3tz\" is not explained. There seems to be something wrong with the derivation from Formula 3 to Formula 4. There should be a more detailed derivation process.  \n\n6. The contributions of this paper are limited. Diffusion and transformers have been proposed for a long time. For Sigformer, transformer and convolution are just simple combinations. The method proposed in this paper seems to be a patchwork of existing techniques.  \n\n7. This paper lacks ablation experiments. Additional experiments are needed to verify the role of each component of Sigformer."

Given that denoising diffusion models are well-studied, it is essential to differentiate prior work from the novel contributions of this paper.\n\nI also recommend expanding Section 2.4 with a comprehensive review of existing approaches. This would help position the proposed methodology more effectively within the domain. For instance, one technique discussed involves patching a 1D signal with positional encoding. The authors are encouraged to reference existing applications of this technique\u2014not necessarily limited to electromagnetic signal recognition\u2014and to clarify the motivation for its use in this context.\n\nA general comment: prior work should not be confined to the introduction or related work sections. I encourage the authors to cite relevant studies for each scientific claim and technique throughout the paper. Clearly distinguishing which methods contribute to the paper\u2019s original work will aid readers in understanding its position within the field and will highlight its unique contributions.\n\nFinally, a specific note: as both denoising diffusion models and transformers are well-researched topics, a straightforward application of these techniques to a new domain may not sufficiently establish originality. Greater emphasis on how these techniques are adapted or innovatively applied would strengthen the paper's contribution."

                "value": "The logic of the writing itself needs to be strengthened. In the Introduction, the author describes the related research on electromagnetic signal recognition using AI and deep learning in recent years (l48-58). However, the problems mentioned in the next paragraph are not problems encountered by existing methods (l59-65). It only describes the problems encountered by traditional signal recognition. Although more recent related research is introduced in A.1 and A.2, these methods have also not been analyzed and compared with the proposed method.\n\nThe DSDM part is very confusing. In particular, the description and formula in Section 2.3 do not match the algorithm in Section A.3 at all. According to the context, algorithm in Section A.3 combines the SIR which is described in Section 2.2, and I guess Section A.3 would be a more correct description of DSDM. In addition, placing the DSDM algorithm in the related work section will make readers confused whether DSDM is the method proposed by the author or an existing method.\n\nAdding noise to the training data is a long-established method to enhance the performance of time-series signal recognition. The experiments cannot explain whether the improvement in effect comes from the denoising process of DSDM or the noise adding for training.\n\nSince the DSDM proposed by the author constrain the step number of diffusion processes t to 1, the author should show the relevant ablation study. Including the constrain of t, not using t as input, and comparison with the original diffusion, etc. The proposed SigFormer also needs to be verified. The author mentioned that the original transformer will cause training instability, but there is no relevant experimental comparison and analysis. Papers that use 1x1 convolution to enhance the performance of the transformer on time-series recognition have not been well cited and compared, such as [a]. And paper that add condition on signal side [b] should also be included in the comparison.\n\nOverall, the correctness and logic of the writing of this paper need to be strengthened. There is also a lack of analytical and experimental results sufficient to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n[a] Eldele, Emadeldeen, et al. \"Tslanet: Rethinking transformers for time series representation learning.\" ICML (2024).\n[b] Li, Yuxin, et al. \"Transformer-Modulated Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.\" ICLR (2024)."
