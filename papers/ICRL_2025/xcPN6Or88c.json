    "title": "ImputeINR: Enhancing Time Series Imputation with Adaptive Group-based Implicit Neural Representations",
    "abstract": "Time series data frequently exhibit the presence of missing values, rendering imputation a crucial process for downstream time series tasks and applications. However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely absent observed values. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module in ImputeINR architecture to capture patterns from different time scales, thereby effectively enhancing the fine-grained and global consistency of the imputation. To address the unique challenges of complex temporal patterns and multiple variables in time series, we design a specific form of INR continuous function that contains three additional components to learn trend, seasonal, and residual information separately. Furthermore, we innovatively propose an adaptive group-based framework to model complex residual information, where variables with similar distributions are modeled by the same group of multilayer perception layers to extract necessary correlation features. Since the number of groups and their output variables are determined by variable clustering, ImputeINR has the capacity of adapting to diverse datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on seven datasets with five ratios of missing values demonstrate the superior performance of ImputeINR, especially for high absent ratios in time series.",

                "value": "This article proposes a new model for the problem of time-series imputation that uses Implicit Neural Representations (INR) for time-series modeling. The model employs a convolutional network to extract multi-scale features from the time series, followed by a transformer encoder. The time series are modeled by an INR decomposed into three sub-functions modeling the trend, seasonality, and residuals. The parameterization of the INR is performed based on the output of the transformer. To facilitate the learning of the residual function, clustering is performed on the different variables of the time series to dedicate a specific MLP to each cluster. Experiments on 7 datasets are conducted, comparing the proposed approach to various state-of-the-art algorithms. An ablation study is also carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of each component."

                "value": "The greatest weakness of the paper, in my opinion, lies in the experimental section and the comparison to existing approaches. There are at least two other papers using INRs for time-series imputation: [1], which is also set in the context of extremely missing observed data (95%), and [2], which uses trend/seasonality/residual decomposition and is also set in the context of a high missing rate. The paper does not cite or compare to these two approaches. Given the similarity of ideas and the relatively few papers on the subject, it seems necessary for the proposed model to be compared to these two approaches.\n\nA minor weakness is the section on clustering, which seems questionable to me. The assumption is that when variables are related, they remain related over time \u2013 as far as I understand, the clustering is done on the entire series. This clustering is only used in the residual part to facilitate learning. I wonder if the same result could not be achieved with better regularization of the MLP network used.\n\n[1] Time Series Continuous Modeling for Imputation and Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations, Le Naour et al., TMLR 2024\n[2] HyperTime: Implicit Neural Representation for Time Series, E.

The word \"novel\" appears multiple times throughout the paper; however, techniques such as INR, clustering, and time series decomposition (including trend, seasonal, and residual components) are well-established and widely utilized in existing research. Additionally, the approach of learning parameters to calculate imputation results through mathematical methods has been explored in prior studies[1]. Although the combination of these elements may provide certain technical contributions, the work lacks a distinctive level of innovation to set it apart from previous works.\n[1] Liu, Shuai, et al. \"Multivariate time-series imputation with disentangled temporal representations.\" The Eleventh international conference on learning representations. 2023.\n\n2. In Equations 9 and 10, the authors use fixed formulas to represent parts of the INR function (trend and seasonal components). While this choice enhances the interpretability of ImputeINR, it also reduces its ability to handle various complex datasets. Could the authors explain why they used these two fixed functions to represent the trend and seasonal components of time series data? Detailed insights will be preferred.\n\n3. The average experimental results obtained by ImputeINR are quite impressive; however, this performance is primarily evident in datasets such as BAQ and IAQ, while the improvements observed on widely used datasets like ETT and Weather are quite modest. Does this indicate that ImputeINR has stringent requirements concerning dataset distribution? The authors are encouraged to clarify which types of datasets are most appropriate for imputation with ImputeINR.\n\n4. The experimental settings require more detailed clarification. BAQ, IAQ, and Solar are datasets containing tens of thousands of time steps, while the experiments presented in this paper utilize only a few hundred or fewer. Furthermore, the training and testing set split ratios vary across datasets, such as Weather and Solar. Similar concerns are observed in other datasets as well.\n\n5. Incorporating SOTA baselines, such as CSDI[2], would enhance the credibility of the experimental results.\n[2] Tashiro, Yusuke, et al. \"Csdi: Conditional score-based diffusion models for probabilistic time series imputation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 24804-24816."

The core idea is to use the ability of INR to learn continuous functions and achieve interpolation. To adapt INR for time series imputation, trend, seasonal and residual items are considered, which are typical operations for modeling temporal data. It is suggested to further highlight the contribution and novelty of proposed framework. Please explicitly compare the proposed approach to existing methods that use trend, seasonal, and residual decomposition, and clearly state what specific innovations this method introduces beyond these typical operations.\n\nW3. As claimed in W1, in experiments, all the datasets are originally complete and only artificial missing values are considered in the evaluation. It is necessary to use real-world incomplete data with large missing rates in experiments to demonstrate the applicability of proposed methods as well as the motivation scenario.\n\nW4. It is also suggested to consider the application study using real-world incomplete datasets, to investigate the performance of using proposed techniques to serve real scenarios.\n\nW5.

However, to my knowledge, other recent studies have addressed this issue, including CSDI (Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation) and SSSD (Diffusion-based Time Series Imputation and Forecasting with Structured State Space Models). The author should include these methods in their experimental comparisons or a comparative discussion of these approaches in the literature review and highlight how ImputeINR are different and better from these approaches for extremely sparse data scenarios.\n\n2. Could the author provide recent advancements in INR for time series, limitations of current INR approaches, or how INR addresses missing values in existing work? For instance, to my knowledge, \"Time Series Continuous Modeling for Imputation and Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations\" also provide an INR framework for data imputation, for which this is not being reviewed in this work.\n\n3.  It is not so clear to me how the author generate the (missing) mask. Could the author clarify how their masks are generated in detail? In Section 4.1, the authors mention that missing values are generated by randomly masking values based on a specified mask rate. Does this imply the missing value are generated according to the missing rate? If so, have the authors also considered block missing scenarios, as proposed in SSSD, where entire segments are missing?\n\n4. Could the authors clarify why the last column in Table 2, showing imputation results with the mean/median baseline, are identical?\nIs this an error in reporting or is it a characteristic of the mean/median imputation method. If this is not an error, the authors could explain and discuss this pattern. \n\n5. Additional detail on the computational complexity of ImputeINR would be helpful. Specifically, how does its computational burden compare to that of other baseline methods?"
