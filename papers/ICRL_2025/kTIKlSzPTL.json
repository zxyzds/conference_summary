    "title": "FutureFill: Fast Generation from Convolutional Sequence Models",
    "abstract": "We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill\u2014a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from linear to square root relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.",

                "value": "The paper proposes FutureFill, a fast generation method designed for convolutional sequence models, aiming to reduce generation time complexity from linear to square root relative to context length. FutureFill utilizes a prefill cache that is theoretically more efficient in both time and memory, requiring less storage than traditional convolutional and attention-based models. The authors validate their approach through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on synthetic generation tasks."

This theoretical improvement addresses one of the core challenges of convolutional models, positioning FutureFill as a potentially valuable contribution to the field of efficient sequence generation. \n2. By using a prefill cache that scales with the number of generated tokens rather than the full context, FutureFill significantly reduces memory overhead. This is particularly valuable in applications where memory is a bottleneck, making the method more accessible for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n3. FutureFill offers an alternative to attention-based models, which suffer from quadratic complexity, especially with longer sequences. By exploring a convolution-based approach, the paper contributes to the broader goal of overcoming the limitations of self-attention in handling long sequences."

Without testing FutureFill on more practical benchmarks or large-scale NLP tasks, it\u2019s difficult to assess its true effectiveness and scalability.\n2. While the authors emphasize efficiency improvements, they do not compare FutureFill against other advanced, optimized generation techniques. \n3. The authors focus mainly on theoretical comparisons with standard convolution and attention models. However, many recent techniques in sequence modeling\u2014such as token pruning, cache compression, or sparse attention mechanisms\u2014are entirely overlooked, which limits the relevance of FutureFill in the context of state-of-the-art sequence generation methods."

The paper briefly mentions the complexity of benchmarking FutureFill on accelerated hardware, but how feasible is it to implement this method in practice? Given the reliance on FFT, how does FutureFill perform on GPUs without optimized FFT support? \n3. The magin formatting of this paper is changed, which may violate the requirement of ICLR."
