    "title": "Diffusion-based Decoupled Deterministic and Uncertain Framework for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Diffusion-based denoising models have demonstrated impressive performance in probabilistic forecasting for multivariate time series (MTS). Nonetheless, existing approaches often model the entire data distribution, neglecting the variability in uncertainty across different components of the time series. This paper introduces a Diffusion-based Decoupled Deterministic and Uncertain ($\\mathrm{D^3U}$) framework for probabilistic MTS forecasting. The framework integrates non-probabilistic forecasting with conditional diffusion generation, enabling both accurate point predictions and probabilistic forecasting. $\\mathrm{D^3U}$ utilizes a point forecasting model to non-probabilistically model high-certainty components in the time series, generating embedded representations that are conditionally injected into a diffusion model. To better model high-uncertainty components, a patch-based denoising network (PatchDN) is designed in the conditional diffusion model. Designed as a plug-and-play framework, $\\mathrm{D^3U}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing point forecasting models to provide probabilistic forecasting capabilities. It can also be applied to other conditional diffusion methods that incorporate point forecasting models. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves over a 20\\% improvement in both point and probabilistic forecasting performance in MTS long-term forecasting compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additionally, extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the $\\mathrm{D^3U}$ framework.",

                "value": "This work introduces a novel diffusion-based time series framework called D3U, designed to enhance probabilistic forecasting. D3U effectively decouples the deterministic and uncertain components of the forecasting process. The conditional network is focused on delivering precise point forecasts, while the conditional DDPM (PatchDN) handles high-uncertainty probabilistic forecasting. Additionally, D3U functions as a plug-and-play framework, allowing for easy integration into existing point forecasting models. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over SOTA baselines."

It combines the point forecasting of seasonal and trend components with a generative sampling model for the residual component.\nThe point forecasting part consists of a well-known model (SparseVQ) and is used to produce a prediction $\\hat y$ of the input time series as well as a latent representation $f_{enc}(x)$ which serves as a condition for the generative part.\nThe generative part is a DDPM which shall produce samples of the residual $y-\\hat y$, the reverse process is hereby conditioned on the latent $f_enc(x)$ and the conditional expectation in the reverse process is modelled by a novel patch-based denoising network $g_\\phi$. \nThe network $g_\\phi$ is comprised of a sine-positional encoder for a strided windows representation of the residuals and transformer encoder blocks. It is conditioned on the latent $f_enc(x)$.\nIn experiments, the model shows competitive or better performance compared to SOTA models on different datasets. The authors conclude that the architecture can serve as framework to obtain a generative sampling model of improved performance for arbitrary point forecasting, conditioning models."

The concept is straightforward: decomposing multivariate time series data into deterministic and uncertain components, using a point forecasting model for the high-certainty component and a conditional diffusion model for the high-uncertainty component. Most of the diffusion design relies on previous work; for example, SparseVQ (Zhao et al., 2024) is used as the conditioning network, and the conditional DDPM is almost the same as the original. The only apparent innovation is the design of the Patch Denoising Network, which itself is not overly complex. Overall, this work feels more like a stitching together of existing methods applied to time series data, with insufficient original contributions."

So, how would you decompose the data in the new scenario? Additionally, if the characteristics of the deterministic and uncertain components in the time series data differ between the new scenario and the training data, how can you ensure the model performs well?"
