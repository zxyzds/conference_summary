    "title": "P(all-atom) Is Unlocking New Path For Protein Design",
    "abstract": "We introduce Pallatom, an innovative protein generation model capable of producing protein structures with all-atom coordinates. Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution $P(\\textit{structure}, \\textit{seq})$ by focusing on $P(\\textit{all-atom})$, effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into token-level and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with \"traversing\" representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.",

                "value": "The paper presents Pallatom, a generative model for protein structures based on all-atom coordinates. Precisely, the standard all-atom representation is extended to obtain the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representation, which pads the original 6 all-atom features with 8 more virtual atoms. At its core, Pallatom is a diffusion generative model which is trained to denoise the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representations, adapting parts of the AlphaFold3 model from the structure prediction to the generative setting. Experiments in _de novo_ protein design show that Pallatom is capable of generating coherent and diverse low-to-medium-sized proteins.\n\n**Judgment**\n\nIn my opinion, this paper is a tremendous effort in solving the de novo protein generation task with denoising diffusion. However, I could not fully appreciate the author's contribution because the way it is presented is rather convoluted and because of some unfortunate choices (such as the rather confusing notation borrowed from another paper). I am sure this has to do with the fact that the authors had to limit the writing to 10 pages. Perhaps ICLR is not the right venue for this kind of papers, because of the page limits; probably a journal article would do more justice to such a technically involved work. I am giving a score of 5 for the moment being, I'll be happy to revise after hearing from my fellow reviewers and the author's replies."

                "value": "**Disclaimer**\n\nI couldn't properly understand the methodological contribution of this paper (details below). This might bias my overall judgment.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nThe main problem with this paper is the way it is presented. While I had no problems in understanding papers on the same subject (e.g. Protpardelle), here I had a very difficult time reading. Some reasons why:\n\n1) the paper takes too many concepts from granted (e.g., the all-atom representation is not explained, examples of sequence/structure conflicts that motivate the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representation are lacking, and so on). Perhaps it would be better to add a brief explanation of the all-atom representation in the introduction, and providing 1-2 specific examples of sequence/structure conflicts in Section 2.1 to motivate the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representation.\n\n2) it uses the unfortunate notation of Karras et al. (2022), which makes understanding the contribution more difficult (e.g. $\\sigma(t)$ vs. $\\sigma_t$, $F_{\\theta}$ undefined). Perhaps you could add a notation table to help the reader. Also please make sure that all the symbols and acronyms used in the paper are defined before or immediately after their first use.\n\n3) it is not well-structured, or at least, it uses section names that are confusing (e.g. section 2 is about \"preliminaries\", yet some contributions, e.g. $\\texttt{atom14}$ are described there). Maybe it would be better to reorganize the sections so that your contribution stands out from work that has already been done, although I understand this could be a very disruptive change.\n\nOther major problems I have found:\n- $\\texttt{atom14}$ is not ablated, it is not clear whether its addition is really needed to improve performances. It would be better to include a specific ablation on Pallatom with and without the $\\texttt{atom14}$ representation, using the metrics you defined for all-atom models.\n- comparing backbone-only models with their own metrics to all-atom models with their own metrics is not really meaningful in my opinion. However, I'm not sure there is a metric that could be used in this case; perhaps you can just compare the ratio of novel and unique protein structures produced by both classes of methods?"

Scalability Constraints on Complex Systems\nPallatom\u2019s training and testing focus largely on shorter protein sequences (up to length 128), and although it exhibits scalability for slightly longer sequences, its practical applicability to more complex protein systems, such as large complexes or multi-chain proteins, remains unclear.\n3.

The authors mention that the dual-track framework is inspired by AlphaFold3, but they do not fully explain the rationale behind their specific modifications to the framework for protein generation. The authors should explain how the traversal atomic-level representations help to prevent the repeated accumulation of redundant structural information.

Discuss the limitations of the Pallatom model in terms of its ability to generate proteins with diverse secondary structures. The results in Figure 2B and 2C show that Pallatom, like other comparative methods, has difficulty generating proteins with predominantly \u03b2-sheet structures. The authors should discuss the reasons for this limitation and potential strategies for addressing it in future work.\n4.  **Explore the potential of Pallatom for designing larger and more complex protein systems, such as antibody complexes and self-assembling materials.** The authors mention this as a direction for future work, but they could expand on the specific challenges and opportunities involved in extending the model to these more complex systems."
