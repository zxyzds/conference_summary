    "title": "Multi-modal graph neural networks for localized off-grid weather forecasting",
    "abstract": "Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface.\nHowever, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground.\nIn this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest.\nThis multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind vector, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts.\nEach data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph.\nUsing message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes.\nExperiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods.\nOur approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.",

For example, instead of doing the ERA5 prediction as proposed in the paper, the prediction results can be further calibrated with the off-grid observations, in this way, the accuracy will be greatly improved. In this case, what is the difference between the proposed approach and the above method. I also would like to see the results. \n2. Missing baselines. There are many SOTA baselines for either grid-based predictions or off-grid predictions, but the authors only compare with some basic methods, more baselines are needed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. Since the method rely on the forecasting results of ERA5, the accuracy will be affected heavily by its values. More experiments and discussion should be added."

I suggest the author consider submitting to a more suitable venue or work towards a more impactful contribution to the topic, rather than an incremental improvement.  I have shown some weakness that I can find in the paper writting aspect but the essential problem of this paper is that lacks breakthrough novelty. \n\n1. The Introduction section lacks a discussion of the motivation. It does not systematically explain the motivation behind the work, nor does it thoroughly compare the proposed model with previous models.\n2. The summary of contributions at the end of the Introduction has a high degree of repetition with earlier sections and is not concise or well-summarized.\n3. The innovative aspect of the model is restrictive. The paper only uses local observation data to adjust global forecasts, which is restrictive.\n4. The presentation of Figure 1 is not closely connected to the context and does not provoke further thought. It is merely shown without being integrated into the discussion. The symbol representing time in Figure 2 is also a bit small.\n5. The related work section only briefly lists some relevant works without providing a systematic or organized analysis. Specifically, in the Gridded Weather Forecasting section, only two types of machine learning methods are listed without explaining their advantages or improvements. It also fails to highlight how the proposed model builds on or innovates beyond previous models.\n6. The Discussion and Conclusion sections are not concise enough. Some paragraphs are overly lengthy, especially in the experimental results section where certain analyses are repeated, making the content appear redundant.\n7. The paper uses many technical terms related to weather forecasting, which may be difficult for cross-disciplinary readers to understand due to a lack of background information.\n8. The paper does not mention the conditions for actual deployment or the hardware resources required, making it hard to replicate the results.\n9. The paper does not discuss limitations, nor does it analyze the computational costs, which affects the credibility of the work.\n10. The Method section lacks an analysis of the model architecture, making it difficult for readers to understand the internal structure of the model.\n11. The paper places the model architecture diagram in the Appendix, which makes it inconvenient for readers and easy to overlook. The author should reorganize the content of the paper.\n12. The paper only describes the meaning of each term in the equations (eqs. 6 and 10) without explaining the overall logic of the equations. There is no explanation of the internal relationships between the equations. The explanations of equations in the Method section are isolated and not interconnected.\n13.
