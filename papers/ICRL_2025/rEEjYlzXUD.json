    "abstract": "The committor functions are central to investigating rare but important events in molecular simulations. It is known that computing the committor function suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Recently, using neural networks to estimate the committor function has gained attention due to its potential for high-dimensional problems. Training neural networks to approximate the committor function needs to sample transition data from straightforward simulations of rare events, which is very inefficient. The scarcity of transition data makes it challenging to approximate the committor function. To address this problem, we propose an efficient framework to generate data points in the transition state region that helps train neural networks to approximate the committor function. We design a Deep Adaptive Sampling method for TRansition paths (DASTR), where deep generative models are employed to generate samples to capture the information of transitions effectively. In particular, we treat a non-negative function in terms of the integrand in the loss functional as an unnormalized probability density function and approximate it with the deep generative model. The new samples from the deep generative model are located in the region of the transition and fewer samples are located in the other region, which provides effective samples for approximating the committor function and significantly improves the accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with both simulations and realistic examples.",

                "value": "1. The proposed method assumes that the metastable states A and B are already identified. In practical molecular dynamics (MD) applications, especially in complex systems, identifying these states can be challenging and may require additional computational methods or expert knowledge. This reliance potentially limits the method\u2019s applicability to systems where metastable states are not well-defined or are difficult to determine. Incorporating a mechanism or providing guidelines for identifying metastable states within the framework would enhance the method\u2019s usability.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that identifying metastable states can be challenging. The committor function essentially quantifies the probability that a stochastic process starting from a point $\\boldsymbol{x}$ will first reach $B$ rather than $A$. Some domain knowledge is required for building the model, i.e., the partial differential equations (PDEs) defined in equation 1. Like other classes of PDEs, the PDE for characterizing the committor function needs to be specified the boundary conditions, which requires additional information. Here, the information on metastable states helps specify the boundary conditions.\n\nAt present, we focus on the numerical approximation of the committor function and not necessarily on the identification of metastable states, which may indeed require prior biological or chemical knowledge. We acknowledge your constructive suggestion to incorporate mechanisms or guidelines for identifying these states within the framework, and we will consider this for future work to enhance the method\u2019s applicability and usability.\n\n2. The current method focuses on estimating the committor function between two metastable states A and B . In practical molecular systems, there are often more than two metastable states that contribute to the system\u2019s dynamics. How can your Deep Adaptive Sampling method be adapted to handle scenarios with three or more metastable states?\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that, in many real problems, there are often more than two metastable states. \n\nIn systems with multiple metastable states, different mathematical models, specifically the partial differential equations (PDEs) and boundary conditions are required. Our current focus is solely on numerically computing the solution of such a PDE defined in equation (2), which are well-established for calculating the committor function between two metastable states. Our method may be directly applied to multiple metastable states if the proper PDE models is built."

                "value": "3. From Figure 2c, DASTR sampled points are incorrect. The sampled particles are not mostly near $A$ or $B$ but reside in between where there is an energy barrier. Is this a mistake in visualization?\n\nFor committor functions, by definition, it is easy to verify that $q(\\boldsymbol{x}) = 0$ for $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in A$ and $q(\\boldsymbol{x}) = 1$ for $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in B$. Hence, we can only focus on the committor function $q$ defined in $\\Omega \\backslash (A \\cup B)$. Training deep neural networks to approximate the committor function requires data points to minimize the loss. The main difficulties come from generating the data points in the transition state region. If one uses the Langevin dynamics to generate data points, then these points cluster around the metastable regions $A$ and $B$ due to the high-energy barriers. This will result in a large generalization error for neural network approximation since we want to estimate the committor function in $\\Omega \\backslash (A \\cup B)$. This is why we develop DASTR. We want to define a proper sampling distribution induced by deep generative models for sampling, which can generate samples on those areas with high-energy barriers. It is good news if the samples generated by DASTR are located in the region $\\Omega \\backslash (A \\cup B)$ , because DASTR is able to provide effective samples in the transition area which is desired for computing the committor function. \n\nThe samples shown in Figure 2(c) are selected at the $2$-th adaptivity iteration. As the adaptivity iteration step increases, the set of samples is located in the transition state region. You can see the numerical results carefully, and the results presented in Table 1 demonstrate the performance of our method, where DASTR is one order of magnitude more accurate than the baseline methods in all settings. \n\n4. Have you tried sampling with lower transition rates, such as on the scales of 1e-5? In this case, the transitions are rare events, so it is more convincing to show the effectiveness of DASTR.\n\nSuch a challenging alanine dipeptide test problem has already been presented in section 5.3, where the scale of the transition rate is $10^{-5}$. Please see the results in this section. By the way, the settings of the rugged Mueller potential test problem in section 5.1 are the same as that of the literature (Jiaxin Yuan et. al., 2024) you listed, but there are no results about the challenging alanine dipeptide problem in the literature (Jiaxin Yuan et al., 2024; Xinru Hua et al., 2023)."

                "value": "1. The paper does not solve a difficult problem in estimating the committor function, for example, rare events with a committor function of 1e-5 scales. Based on Figure 5, the committor function has a smooth curve from 0 to 1 and requires not that many sample sizes to estimate. In this case, even uniform sampling can obtain good results. It is hard to convince the readers that the deep adaptive sampling method can save high simulation costs and be extended to difficult rare event sampling problems.\n\nFirst, the curve in Figure 5 is not the committor function itself. Please look at the curve in Figure 5 carefully. Figure 5 is the committor function evaluated along the curve $\\{(\\kappa, \\ldots, \\kappa)^\\top : \\kappa \\in [a/\\sqrt{d}, b/\\sqrt{d}]\\}$. This figure shows that even for a specific curve, the relative error of DASTR is smaller than that of other sampling strategies. Why do we show the solution in this curve? Because this is a $20$-dimensional problem, not just a one-dimensional test problem. Using this curve to visualize the solution results is suggested by the literature (Nusken \\& Richter, 2023). Again, it is not the committor function itself in Figure 5.  \n  \nSecond, for this test problem, you can see that the relative error is about $10^{-1}$ for uniform sampling and SDE (please see Figure 5(b), 5(c) and Table 2), where the SDE sampling strategies are used in the literature (Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022). DASTR is one order of magnitude more accurate than the baseline methods. So why do you say uniform sampling can obtain good results? \n    \nThird, please see the alanine dipeptide test problem and read section 5.3 carefully. This is a well-known challenging and realistic test problem for estimating the committor function, where the scale of the transition rate is $10^{-5}$. Specifically, the isomerization process of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum at $T= 300K$ is studied. The goal is to compute the committor function under the CHARMM force filed (Jo et al., 2008; Brooks et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2016). Due to the high energy barrier between the two metastable states $A$ and $B$, it is almost impossible for the molecule to cross this barrier from $A$ to $B$. DASTR is used to solve such a realistic example. The results are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. The results obtained by our method matches the reference solution computed by expensive simulations well.\n\n2. The paper misses many related work citations and comparisons with these methods. The experiments only have a comparison with uniform sampling and SDE sampling, and there are many other methods to compare.\n\nWe aim to compute the committor function governed by the partial differential equation. We use a deep neural network to approximate the committor function, which requires minimizing a loss over a set of random samples. We can cite these references you listed in the revised manuscript. Moreover, we have checked the references you listed. Except for (Lars Holdijk et al., 2023), the other two references do not include the alanine dipeptide test problem. Also, the literature  (Khoo et al., 2019) is already listed in the related work section (Please see section 2). The method proposed in this literature (Khoo et al., 2019) is to discretize the variational loss by sampling from the SDE, which is exactly one of the baselines in our numerical experiments (Please see section 5.1 and section 5.2)."
