    "title": "Physics-aligned field reconstruction with diffusion bridge",
    "abstract": "The reconstruction of physical fields from sparse measurements is pivotal in both scientific research and engineering applications. Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles. Additionally, a boundary-aware sampling technique is implemented to ensure adherence to physical boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PalSB through its application to three complex nonlinear systems: cylinder flow from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. The results reveal that PalSB not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits enhanced compliance with physical constraints compared to existing methods. This highlights PalSB's capability to generate high-quality representations of intricate physical interactions, showcasing its potential for advancing field reconstruction techniques.",

Additionally, they adapt their sampling procedure to be \"boundary-aware\" by padding the input appropriately and achieve good performance with a small number of function evaluations through \"early-stop sampling.\""

The authors convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by evaluating it across three datasets (with two tasks each) and comparing it against several reasonable baselines. Further, they conduct an ablation study, reinforcing the value of their design choices. The early stop sampling strategy in particular could prove to be useful outside of the context of physical field reconstruction as well. The method and results are presented clearly with only minor clarifications needed."

                "value": "This paper presents the Physics-aligned Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (PalSB) method, developed for reconstructing physical fields from sparse data subject to physical constraints. Reconstruction of physical fields is a key task in fields such as fluid mechanics, meteorology, and astrophysics, where spatiotemporal information about systems must be recovered from sparse, often noisy, observations. Despite significant advances in machine learning and the use of diffusion models to solve complex data problems, many existing approaches fail to satisfy physical laws and struggle to cope with the nonlinear nature of complex physical systems.\n\nPalSB proposes a new approach to data reconstruction that incorporates a diffusion bridge mechanism (Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge) specifically adapted to satisfy physical constraints. The model is trained in two stages: the first stage focuses on local reconstruction map construction, and the second stage focuses on global physical principles. This combination allows for the creation of super-resolved data that not only more accurately but also better satisfy physical constraints than similar methods.\n\nThe pretraining stage of PalSB is based on a diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger bridge, which allows for efficient transition between high-quality and corrupted data distributions. To reduce computational costs and improve the accuracy of the model, the training process is performed on small local patches of the high-resolution field. This helps the model focus on the local structure of the data, avoiding the need for large computational resources. The second stage involves Physics-aligned Finetuning, which allows the model to fit physical laws represented as differential equations. This stage minimizes deviations from physical laws using a combination of physically informed and regression loss functions.\n\nThe paper also proposes boundary-aware sampling to handle boundary conditions and early stopping sampling, which improves the generation efficiency and reduces the number of required steps. These strategies allow the model to better account for global conditions and significantly improve the performance of PalSB.\n\nThree complex physical systems were chosen to evaluate PalSB: flow around a cylinder, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. Based on the benchmark results, PalSB demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and physical compliance compared to other methods, including interpolation, end-to-end models, and physically informed diffusion models (PIDM). In particular, PalSB significantly reduces physical inconsistencies and improves the compliance with spatial patterns in both Fourier and real space interpolation problems.\n\nThe study also showed that removing individual PalSB modules (e.g., physically consistent tuning or boundary-aware sampling) degrades the physical compliance and model performance. This highlights the importance of PalSB's integrated approach to achieve high accuracy and compliance with physical laws.\n\nIn conclusion, PalSB demonstrates great potential for field reconstruction in complex systems, showing high quality data recovery and improved compliance with physical constraints. In the future, PalSB is expected to be extended to 3D problems, which will cover a wider range of scientific and engineering applications that require compliance with physical laws during the generation process."
