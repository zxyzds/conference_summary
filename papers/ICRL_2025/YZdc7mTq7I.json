    "title": "GeoMind: A Geometric Neural Network of State Space Model for Understanding Brain Dynamics on Riemannian Manifold",
    "abstract": "State space model (SSM) is a powerful tool in neuroscience field to characterize the dynamic nature of brain functions by elucidating the mechanism of how brain system transits between brain states and how underlying states give rise to the observed neural activities. Although tremendous efforts have been made to lend the power of deep learning and mathematical insight of SSM in various functional neuroimaging studies, current state-of-the-art methods lack a holistic view of brain state evolution as a self-organized dynamical system where each part of the brain is functionally inter-connected. Since the topological co-activation of functional fluctuations exhibits an intrinsic geometric pattern (symmetric and positive definite, or SPD) on the Riemannian manifold, the call for understanding how a selective set of functional connectivities in the brain supports diverse behavior and cognition emerges a new machine learning scenario of manifold-based SSM for large-scale functional neuroimages. To that end, we propose a geometric neural networks, coined *GeoMind*, designed to uncover evolving brain states by tracking the trajectory of functional dynamics on a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. Our *GeoMind* demonstrates promising results in identifying specific brain states based on task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, as well as in diseases early diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Autism. These results highlight the applicability of the proposed *GeoMind* in neuroscience research. Furthermore, to assess the generalization capabilities of our model, we applied it to the domain of human action recognition (HAR), achieving promising performance on three benchmark datasets (UTKinect, Florence and HDM05). This demonstrates the scalability and robustness of the proposed geometry deep model of SSM in capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse fields.",

A stronger motivation, with an explanation of the specific benefits that the Riemannian manifold brings to neuroimaging tasks, would make the choice more convincing.\n2. In my view, the main contribution of the paper lies in replacing the Euclidean algebra of conventional SSMs with Riemannian geometric algebra and applying this to fMRI images.

In addition to feature/model interpretation, does the GaA module also improve the prediction?\n4.

In addition to manifold learning, it is also common to apply the tangent space projection to brain connectome data before feeding it into ML/DL models. Comparison with it would also be helpful to demonstrate the strength of learning on SPD.\n6. In model comparison, BOLD signals were used as graph embeddings for the graph-based models. As BOLD signals are not directly comparable across different individuals (especially for resting-state fMRI), using static FC as embeddings may improve these models' performance. \n7.
