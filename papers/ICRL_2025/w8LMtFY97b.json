    "title": "Hierarchical Uncertainty Estimation for Learning-based Registration in Neuroimaging",
    "abstract": "Over recent years, deep learning based image registration has achieved impressive accuracy in many domains, including medical imaging and, specifically, human neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the uncertainty estimation associated with these methods has been largely limited to the application of generic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) that do not exploit the peculiarities of the problem domain, particularly spatial modeling. Here, we propose a principled way to propagate uncertainties (epistemic or aleatoric) estimated at the level of spatial location by these methods, to the level of global transformation models, and further to downstream tasks. Specifically, we justify the choice of a Gaussian distribution for the local uncertainty modeling, and then propose a framework where uncertainties spread across hierarchical levels, depending on the choice of transformation model. Experiments on publicly available data sets show that Monte Carlo dropout correlates very poorly with the reference registration error, whereas our uncertainty estimates correlate much better. % with the reference registration error. Crucially, the results also show that uncertainty-aware fitting of transformations improves the registration accuracy of brain MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate how sampling from the posterior distribution of the transformations can be used to propagate uncertainties to downstream neuroimaging tasks.",

                "value": "Authors present a method to estimate the uncertainty in medical image registration at 3 different stages: (1) on the estimate of the distribution of the deformation field at each voxel (assuming this is Gaussian and gathering a mean and standard deviation per point), (2) on the distribution of the fitted transformation, and (3) on the distribution of possible outcomes on the downstream task. The uncertainty from the first level is used in the transformation fitting step weighting down contributions from less certain pixels. By drawing samples of the fitted transformation, a distribution of results for the same downstream task is generated which is used to estimate the 3rd level of uncertainty. Authors demonstrate their approach in the context of registration-based Brain image segmentation where the given input image is deformed to match the standard MNI atlas and the labels from the atlas are propagated to the deformed image."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The presentation could be improved. The background, motivation, and knowledge gap are not clearly explained, making it challenging to follow the paper\u2019s purpose and direction. Although the study is about why uncertainty estimation matters in brain registration, it doesn\u2019t make a strong case for why this is important. There isn\u2019t enough support or reasoning behind this focus, which leaves readers unsure about the value or impact of the work.\n2. The experiments are insufficient. This paper only compares its method to a single approach, RbR. Although RbR was released in 2024, it is still unpublished and available only on arXiv, which makes it less robust as a baseline for comparison. Including more established and published baselines would be essential to provide a solid foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n3. From the experimental results (e.g., Table 1), the introduction of uncertainty estimation does not appear to provide a statistically significant improvement to the model. This makes it difficult to assess its effectiveness and raises questions about the practical value of incorporating uncertainty estimation into the approach.\n4. Most of the latest work in brain registration focuses on unsupervised learning, largely due to the high cost of collecting accurate transformation ground-truth for high-dimensional images (e.g., 3D MRI). However, this paper still stay on a supervised learning approach, making it seem less aligned with current trends and potentially less practical for real-world applications where labeled data is limited.\n5. The evaluation criteria lack validity. This paper collects ground-truth transformations using NiftyReg, a tool introduced around 15 years ago. Since then, more state-of-the-art methods have been shown to outperform NiftyReg, indicating that the ground-truth it provides may be inaccurate. This undermines the reliability of the results presented in the paper and raises concerns about the credibility of its findings.\n6. The novelty of this work is limited. The main contribution appears to be the addition of an uncertainty loss term, while the other loss terms and network architecture are based on existing work. This incremental improvement does not significantly advance the field, as much of the framework relies on previously established methods."

For modeling epistemic uncertainty, why did the author choose to use Monte Carlo dropout, and how exactly was it implemented?\n3. Given that the deformation field (non-linear transformation) is a high-dimensional tensor, how do authors verify the accuracy of the ground-truth labels when collecting them? As I understand, NiftyReg is a registration method\u2014if this method is used to generate ground-truth labels, does that imply the proposed method can only perform as well as NiftyReg at best?\n4. The total training loss includes multiple terms marked as optional in the paper. Are these terms truly necessary? Was an ablation study conducted to assess their impact on performance?"
