    "title": "InstantSplamp: Fast and Generalizable Stenography Framework for Generative Gaussian Splatting",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large generative models for 3D, especially the evolution from NeRF representations to more efficient Gaussian Splatting, the synthesis of 3D assets has become increasingly fast and efficient, enabling the large-scale publication and sharing of generated 3D objects. However, while existing methods can add watermarks or steganographic information to individual 3D assets, they often require time-consuming per-scene training and optimization, leading to watermarking overheads that can far exceed the time required for asset generation itself, making deployment impractical for generating large collections of 3D objects. To address this, we propose InstantSplamp a framework that seamlessly integrates the 3D steganography pipeline into large 3D generative models without introducing explicit additional time costs. Guided by visual foundation models,InstantSplamp subtly injects hidden information like copyright tags during asset generation, enabling effective embedding and recovery of watermarks within generated 3D assets while preserving original visual quality. Experiments across various potential deployment scenarios demonstrate that \\model~strikes an optimal balance between rendering quality and hiding fidelity, as well as between hiding performance and speed. Compared to existing per-scene optimization techniques for 3D assets, InstantSplamp reduces their watermarking training overheads that are multiples of generation time to nearly zero, paving the way for real-world deployment at scale.",

                "value": "InstantSplamp introduces a fast, scalable framework that embeds hidden information like copyright tags into 3D generative models without additional processing time. Leveraging visual foundation models and cross-attention mechanisms, this approach integrates watermarking directly within the 3D Gaussian Splatting process. Unlike traditional methods requiring per-scene optimization, InstantSplamp minimizes overhead to nearly zero, enabling efficient large-scale deployment of watermarked 3D assets. A U-Net-based decoder recovers the hidden information, balancing visual quality with steganographic fidelity. This innovation addresses scalability challenges in 3D asset generation and protection, optimizing both watermark embedding and retrieval."

Although it performs much better compared to StegaNeRF, the impact on visual quality due to watermark injection seems counterproductive.\n- There is no 360-degree visual quality demo, and only two views are provided, which makes it hard to assess the rendering quality of the 3D assets and the quality of watermark extraction. It\u2019s unclear whether the rendering quality of the 3D assets is 3D consistent.\n- From the data in Table 1, the rendering quality of your method is not significantly better than LSB or DeepStega, and there\u2019s no comparison with the latest method, GS-Hider.\n\nGS-Hider: Hiding Messages into 3D Gaussian Splatting"

In the recovery stage, the decoder network extracts the hidden image exclusively from the rendering of a specific viewpoint. Additionally, an adaptive gradient harmonization technique is introduced, which functions as a masking mechanism, embedding the hidden information within certain model weights to preserve both steganographic ability and the visual quality of the renderings."

While Figure 1 illustrates the time efficiency improvements of the proposed method for watermarking, could you provide some quantitative experimental results to further emphasize this point?\n2. The robustness testing only considers two types of corruptions (JPEG compression and Gaussian blur), which seems limited in scope. It would be valuable to include additional forms of corruption, such as noise, scaling, or cropping, for a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, a comparative robustness analysis with other state-of-the-art methods is missing, which would provide a clearer understanding of how InstantSplamp performs under various conditions.\n3. How does the proposed method compare with other 3D watermarking approaches targeting binary messages, such as those for NeRF or other 3D representations?
