    "title": "CAMMARL: Conformal Action Modeling in Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Before taking actions in an environment with more than one intelligent agent, an autonomous agent may benefit from reasoning about the other agents and utilizing a notion of a guarantee or confidence about the behavior of the system. In this article, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm CAMMARL, which involves modeling the actions of other agents in different situations in the form of confident sets, i.e., sets containing their true actions with a high probability. We then use these estimates to inform an agent\u2019s decision-making. For estimating such sets, we use the concept of conformal predictions, by means of which, we not only obtain an estimate of the most probable outcome but get to quantify the operable uncertainty as well. For instance, we can predict a set that provably covers the true predictions with high probabilities (e.g., 95%). Through several experiments in two fully cooperative multi-agent tasks, we show that CAMMARL elevates the capabilities of an autonomous agent in MARL by modeling conformal prediction sets over the behavior of other agents in the environment and utilizing such estimates to enhance its policy learning",

The authors test this in Section 5, but they do not really give enough information on the alternative approach (APU) for me to understand. I have trouble following the arguments in the paragraph starting on line 469, and I would appreciate additional information/clarifications to better follow these arguments.\nRelated to this: I have difficulties following the sentence in line 423ff: \u201c(5) CAMMARL can be preferred over strong benchmarks such as EAP owing to its higher interpretability due to the theoretical guarantees of conformal predictions in terms of coverage (Angelopoulos et al., 2020) (discussed more in Section 6).\u201d \u2013 I am not sure that there is enough evidence for claiming that the theoretical guarantees of conformal predictions are the reason for the better performance. Firstly, these theoretical guarantees are only valid under certain assumptions, and I am not sure they are fulfilled in this case. Secondly, my intuition would be that the reason is that (a) uncertainty information does help and (b) maybe the specific format provided by the conformal predictions is easier to handle than other uncertainty predictions. In any case, the sentence should be weakened and some additional discussion in Section 5 would be appreciated. \nIn this context, the reference to Section 6 is also unclear, maybe you mean Section 5?"

For example, including success rates and reward values would provide a clearer picture of agent performance improvements during evaluation.\n\nA comprehensive assessment of agent performance with the trained model is missing. Adding metrics such as success rates, average rewards, and perf across varying conditions during post-training evaluation would significantly strengthen the experimental results section.\n\nThe claim regarding trends in confidence coverage needs more support, as the current presentation in Figure 7 is inconclusive.
