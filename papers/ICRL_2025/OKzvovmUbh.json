    "title": "Learning Universal Features for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization",
    "abstract": "In recent years, advanced image editing and generation methods have rapidly evolved, making detecting and locating forged image content increasingly challenging. Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying the edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different forgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included in the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones.\nIn response, we present an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL). Once trained, our model can detect both seen and unseen forgeries, providing a more practical and efficient solution to counter false information in the era of generative AI. \nOur method focuses on learning general features from the pristine content rather than traces of specific forgeries, which are relatively consistent across different types of forgeries and therefore can be used as universal features to locate unseen forgeries. Additionally, as existing image forgery datasets are still dominated by traditional hand-crafted forgeries, we construct a new dataset consisting of images edited by various popular deep generative image editing methods to further encourage research in detecting images manipulated by deep generative models. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the detection of unseen forgeries and also demonstrates competitive results for seen forgeries.",

This is counterintuitive because models typically perform better on the training set (seen forgeries) than on the test set (unseen forgeries). The fact that GIFL struggles slightly more with forgeries it was trained on suggests that this may be due to the use of the same pristine images in both the training and test data. This overlap could artificially inflate performance on unseen forgeries compared to other models, as the model may learn underlying features from the pristine content rather than focusing solely on identifying manipulations. This approach might lead to improved generalization to unseen manipulations but may not be as robust in detecting forgeries in scenarios where both the image content and forgery types are more variable.\n* The paper lacks clear details on how the dataset is split between training and testing, particularly regarding out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. It appears that the same images with different manipulations are used for both ID and OOD evaluations, which might blur the distinction between the two. Additionally, there is no clear indication of whether entirely unseen images (not present in the training set, even in pristine form) are included in the OOD test set. This undermines the claim of the model\u2019s generalization ability, as the testing protocol may not fully represent a challenging OOD scenario."

It would be helpful to clarify if \"domain\" refers to spatial vs. spectral representations and if \"depth\" is related to different layers in the transformer or network architecture.\n* In Fig. 1, it appears that FtF_tFt\u200b is not directly an input to UFLT, but this line seems to suggest otherwise: \"We then utilize a Universal Forgery Localization Transformer (UFLT) to align the features of the forged image with those of the partial image.\" Could you clarify how this alignment process is done beyond what\u2019s mentioned about the loss function? Is the alignment occurring explicitly within the layers of UFLT, or is it primarily driven by the loss function guiding the final output?\n* While GIFL shows notable improvements on unseen forgeries, there is a slight performance drop on seen forgery types compared to existing methods, as noted in the comparison with LDM and CTSDG. How do you explain this gap, given that GIFL performs better in many visual samples? What aspect of the network or loss function might be responsible for the lower performance on seen forgeries with these methods?\n* The paper mentions the use of the same images with different manipulations for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Are there any images in the testing set that do not appear in the training set, even in pristine form? Specifically, do you test the model on both OOD image types and OOD manipulation types simultaneously?

                "value": "Methodology:\n- I concur with the viewpoint that \"authentic features ... are more consistent across different types of forgeries and can be used as universal features.\" Along this line, I think it is possible to train and extract universal authentic features using only authentic data (e.g., [1*, 2*] that use only authentic data to learn camera fingerprints to build forgery localization algorithms), which would further substantiate this view. Unfortunately, in Sec. 3.1, the authors only utilize forged data to construct the training process, lacking further discussion and analysis in this regard.\n\nTechnology:\n- The UFLT proposed in Sec. 3.2 is not fully compared with existing methods (FFC, ViT, and other spectral detection networks), and lacks reasonable research motivation. For example, the statement in line 208 that \"these methods can only extract the spectral traces of some specific forgeries\" lacks evidence support. It is recommended that the authors add experimental phenomena to illustrate the shortcomings of existing methods and the advantages of the proposed method.\n\nDataset: Although the authors have created the new ForgeryADE dataset, it does not exhibit significant improvements or unique attributes for the IFL task.\n- Firstly, in terms of dataset scale, it comprises only 20,000 original training images and 2,000 test images with a relatively low resolution (512x512), which falls short compared to existing large dataset like [3*].\n- Secondly, in terms of the generation process, randomly selecting masks and reconstructing them using (not the latest GAN or Diffusion) generation methods is also like the existing dataset construction process.\n- Lastly, regarding data quality, examples from ForgeryADE (shown in the first column of Figure 3, such as CTSDG and SSDE in the left column, and Deepfillv2 and DDNM in the right column) exhibit noticeable visual flaws. It is recommended that the authors employ a quality assessment system to filter out low-quality synthetic forgery data.\n- Therefore, I do not believe ForgeryADE could stand as an independent core contribution point. Perhaps, considering creating more intriguing datasets from a multimodal perspective (such as text, speech, etc., controlling the forgery process) could be a more interesting approach.\n\nExperiments:\n- The core focus of this paper is on learning general features for unseen data. However, the training and test sets remain within the same domain (\"each of these methods is applied to ... training images and test images,\" as mentioned in line 258). This experimental setup makes it challenging to demonstrate whether the proposed method can effectively learn sufficient cross-domain, general features.\n- In the comparative experiments, the authors indicate that they retrained the models of their competitors. However, there is a lack of detailed explanation on how this retraining was conducted, which could potentially result in the competitor algorithms not achieving their intended effects. A fairer approach would involve conducting control experiments using the same training and test sets that the competitors all share. For instance, CAT-Net, FOCAL, and TruFor all utilized the same training set.\n\nSmall question:\n- The original size of the images in the ForgeryADE is 512x512, so why is line 308 experimented on a size of 448x448?\n\n[1*] \u201cExif as language: Learning cross-modal associations between images and camera metadata\u201d in CVPR\u201923.\n\n[2*] \u201cNoiseprint: A CNN-based camera model fingerprint\u201d in TIFS\u201919.\n\n[3*] \u201cRethinking Image Editing Detection in the Era of Generative AI Revolution\u201d in ACM MM\u201924."
