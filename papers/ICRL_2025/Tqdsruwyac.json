    "abstract": "Models of virtual cells and virtual tissues at single-cell resolution would allow us to test perturbations in silico and accelerate progress in tissue and cell engineering. However, most such models are not rooted in causal inference and as a result, could mistake correlation for causation.\nWe introduce Celcomen, a novel generative graph neural network grounded in mathematical causality to disentangle intra- and inter-cellular gene regulation in spatial transcriptomics and single-cell data. Celcomen can also be prompted by perturbations to generate spatial counterfactuals, thus offering insights into experimentally inaccessible states, with potential applications in human health. We validate the model's disentanglement and identifiability through simulations, and demonstrate its counterfactual predictions in clinically relevant settings, including human glioblastoma and fetal spleen, recovering inflammation-related gene programs post immune system perturbation. Moreover, it supports mechanistic interpretability, as its parameters can be reverse-engineered from observed behavior, making it an accessible model for understanding both neural networks and complex biological systems.",

The motivation is well explained and the results on the impact of perturbed spot on surrounding cells are very convincing. It shows why we need to consider cell communication on spacial omnics data. \n3. The idea is novel. The author links GRN inference among neighboring cells with entropy maximization under the control of some lagrangian multipliers, which are then modeled by GNN. Theorem 1 is also inspiring."

For example, the author used $s^i_{\\alpha}$, $s^\\alpha_{i}$, and $s_{\\alpha i}$ to refer the same concept.\n\n2. While I understand this is one of the first few papers studying, the lack of baseline comparisons in the experiments makes the results section less convincing. For example, while the results does show the impact of perturbed spot on surrounding area, how accurate it is? With GNN, I'm not surprised to see this kind of phenomenon. Are there any ways to provide a quantitative measurement or comparisons with the methods? Could you add some baselines or ground truth comparison?\n\n3. A common acknowledged fact is that for causal models, there is a huge gap between synthetic data and the data we observe in real life. While the idea of in-silico perturbation data generation is very interesting, can you discuss the similarity/difference between the generated data and real data?"

                "value": "1. In section 3.1, you mentioned that the inspiration of this work comes from the notion of force in physics and the objective is to learn the \"least\" number of forces. Then you said \"'least' here is in the sense of entropy\". However, later on, all we are trying to do is to maximize entropy. After thinking, I think I sort of understand the concept but someone else may get stuck too. Could you add a bit more explanation on how does the objective of minimizing number of forces transform into maximizing the entropy?\n\n2. Could you comment on the runtime of this algorithm? Also, how long does it take (clock time) to finish the experiment you did in your study?"

                "value": "The main weakness of the manuscript is its poor connection to the underlying biology, as exemplified by the two issues below.\n\n- The authors present a set of three assumptions upon which their whole model relies. However, they never discuss the implications of these assumptions, and without appropriate commentary, I frankly find difficult to understand what these assumptions entails. How do their assumptions compare with respect to the current limits of spatial transcriptomics technologies? Are there specific conditions, tissues, or other situations where these assumptions may not hold? Moreover, how are these assumptions related to more classical assumptions of causal learning theory, namely faithfulness, Markov condition, and causal sufficiency?\n\n- Cells in tissues are usually grouped within functional clusters. Most typically, cells will belong to distinct cell types, which depending on the type of tissue may located together (endothelial cells in the inner layers of blood vessels) or scattered across the connecting matrix (e.g., fibroblast in mussle tissue). Other cases are possible as well: for example, glutamatergic neurons in the cortex will belong to different layers, where each layer will have different roles in cognitive functions. To my understanding, in its current iteration the Celcomen method fully disregards information on cell types or other functional clustering, even if this information can be instrumental in better understanding cell to cell communication mechanisms. For example, causal relationships between cell may be largely dictate on whether these cells are of the same or of different type."

However, I would suggest that the authors:\n- Acknowledge this limitation of their current model\n- Discuss how disregarding cell type information may impact the interpretation of their results\n- Propose specific ways the model could be extended in future work to incorporate cell type or functional cluster information"
