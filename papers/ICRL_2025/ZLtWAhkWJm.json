    "abstract": "Developing robust physics-informed representations of chemical structures that enable models to learn topological inductive biases is challenging. In this manuscript, we present a representation of atomistic systems. We begin by proving that our representation satisfies all structural, geometric, efficiency, and generalizability constraints. Afterward, we provide a general algorithm to encode any atomistic system. Finally, we report performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on numerous tasks. We open-source all code and datasets. The anonymized code and data are available in the supplementary material.",

In particular, the representation 'stitches' together representations of different neutrons, protons and electrons. The authors prove that polyatomic complexes satisfy (rotational, translational, permutational) invariances, continuity (with respect to atomic positions), generalizability (in the sense of being well-defined for arbitrary chemical compounds) and topological accuracy (upto electronic structure).\nThe authors perform experiments on the photoswitches, ESOL, FreeSolv and Matbench JDFT2D dataset with two variants of their method (Fast Complex and Deep Complex), and find comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.\n\nMy main concerns are the readability of the paper together with the lack of convincing empirical results (which the authors also admit to). It would be nice to come up with a task where this representation is provably better than existing methods."

For example, Figure 1 is barely readable due to small text, and there is extra whitespace throughout the paper (eg. \"( 2.12)\" on page 3 and so forth.)\n- The modeling assumption of an electron as a single sphere is quite chemically inaccurate (especially for delocalized systems). It would be good for the authors to discuss this weakness and how to improve this aspect of their representation.\n- Experimental results are not super convincing, given that the RMSE of their method is often much higher than state-of-the-art methods. The authors do mention this as a weakness, but I would like to see how improvements can be made."

This is a big assumption, do the results change significantly if missing values are removed?\n- Please highlight your method in all tables for clarity.\n- What exactly is the role of the random matrix denoting proton-electron interactions?

I suggest the authors to check the original ACE paper (Ralf Drautz, PRB 2019). The permutation invariant within atoms of the same element is achieved by simply summing over basis function of neighbor displacement, and by using clusters it also circumvents the (J N) summation.\n    - In line 391, the authors state that the electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force hold the atom together, which is not a physically correct statement.\n- The construction with proton, neutron, and electron is not very physically meaningful for the tasks of interests. This is just to obtain a representation for a single atom, which basically includes only the element and isotope information. A direct embedding on the element type will be simpler and achieve the same goal and learnable.\n- In the comparison with other methods, this method does not show impressive results.

We are skeptical about the necessity of these additional criteria.  Molecular representation is a lossy compression of information, and expecting a perfect representation of all properties may be challenging. Perhaps focusing on certain aspects while neglecting others could be more helpful for specific tasks. For example, electronic structure information and topological accuracy may not be very helpful in predicting macroscopic properties such as solubility, which is also experimentally demonstrated in Table2 and Table 3. Have the authors discussed why these criteria are added and are these additional criteria really useful?\n\n\n\n[1] M. F. Langer, A. Goe\u00dfmann, and M.

Section 2 lacks sufficient explanations connecting the lemmas and theorems, making it challenging to follow the argument. The description of the algorithm in Section 2.3 is brief and does not fully clarify the logic. Additionally, Figure 2 is uninformative and takes up space that could be better used to elaborate on the explanation and discussion.\n\nW2: The experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness or utility of the new representation. Across most datasets, the performance of the proposed representation is suboptimal, failing to justify its usefulness. The experiments focus solely on property prediction performance. It would be more informative to include comparisons of computational cost, assessments of generalizability, evaluations of long-range interaction capabilities against machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models, and tests on datasets where other representations struggle due to issues such as lack of uniqueness. In such cases, MLIP models could serve as a meaningful baseline due to their ability to represent diverse materials.\n\nW3:  Due to the suboptimal layout, the sections on experiments and discussions (Sections 3 and 4) are very brief and lack insightful analysis that could demonstrate the effectiveness of the new representation.\n\nIn conclusion, the current draft requires substantial revisions before it can be considered for acceptance.
