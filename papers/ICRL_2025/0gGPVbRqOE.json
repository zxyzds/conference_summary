    "title": "Splitted Wavelet Differential Inclusion for neural signal processing",
    "abstract": "Wavelet shrinkage is a powerful tool in neural signal processing. It has been applied to various types of neural signals, such as non-invasive signals and extracellular recordings. For example, in Parkinson's disease (PD), $\\beta$ burst activities in local field potentials (LFP) signals indicated pathological information, which corresponds to \\emph{strong signal} with higher wavelet coefficients. However, it has been found that there also exists \\emph{weak signal} that should not be ignored. This weak signal refers to the set of small coefficients, which corresponds to the non-burst/tonic activity in PD. While it lacks the interpretability of the strong signal, neglecting it may result in the omission of movement-related information during signal reconstruction. However, most existing methods mainly focused on strong signals, while ignoring weak signals. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Splitted Wavelet Differential Inclusion}, which is provable to achieve better estimation of both the strong signal and the whole signal. Equipped with an $\\ell_2$ splitting mechanism, we derive the solution path of a couple of parameters in a newly proposed differential inclusion, of which the sparse one can remove bias in estimating the strong signal and the dense parameter can additionally capture the weak signal with the $\\ell_2$ shrinkage. The utility of our method is demonstrated by the improved accuracy in a numerical experiment and additional findings of tonic activity in PD.",

                "value": "The paper presents a novel method, the Splitted Wavelet Differential Inclusion (SWDI), for enhancing neural signal analysis, particularly for applications related to Parkinson\u2019s disease. SWDI introduces a dual-parameter approach that estimates both the strong and whole signals simultaneously, addressing limitations of previous wavelet shrinkage techniques. The authors demonstrate that their closed-form solution path improves estimation accuracy for both signal components. This work contributes to the field of neural signal processing by offering a robust framework for analyzing complex neural data, which could have significant clinical applications in neurodegenerative disease research."

The authors approach this challenge using wavelet analysis, where they propose to partition the signal into strong and weak components based on the magnitudes of the wavelet coefficients. The paper presents a new method, termed Splitted Wavelet Differential Inclusion (SWDI), which is designed to recover the strong component by employing a differential inclusion framework. It is shown theoretically and empirically in a simulation that the proposed method recovers the strong signal more accurately than other methods based on wavelet shrinkage. Additionally, the method is demonstrated in application to neural signals, where the goal is to identify medication effects on Parkinson\u2019s disease."
