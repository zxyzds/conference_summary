    "title": "IgGM: A Generative Model for Functional Antibody and Nanobody Design",
    "abstract": "Immunoglobulins are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to identify and bind to foreign substances, playing an essential role in shielding organisms from infections and diseases. Designing specific antibodies opens new pathways for disease treatment. With the rise of deep learning, AI-driven drug design has become possible, leading to several methods for antibody design. However, many of these approaches require additional conditions that differ from real-world scenarios, making it challenging to incorporate them into existing antibody design processes. Here, we introduce IgGM, a generative model for the de novo design of immunoglobulins with functional specificity. IgGM produces antibody sequences and structures simultaneously for a given antigen, consisting of three core components: a pre-trained language model for extracting sequence features, a feature learning module for identifying pertinent features, and a prediction module that outputs designed antibody sequences and the predicted complete antibody-antigen complex structure. IgGM has shown effectiveness in both predicting structures and designing novel antibodies and nanobodies, making it relevant in various practical scenarios of antibody and nanobody design.",

                "value": "The article discusses the challenges in practical applications where obtaining the structures of antigens and antibodies (including the framework region) is often unfeasible. To address this, it introduces an end-to-end algorithm called IgGM, which simultaneously predicts the sequences and structures of the CDR regions, performs docking based on the epitope, and predicts the structure of the antigen-antibody complex. Additionally, the article employs a two-stage training method to enhance the model's performance in predicting both structures and sequences."

The model can not only design amino acids in the CDR region, but also complete antigen docking, which is unprecedented. IgGM not only has excellent performance in predicting antibody structure, especially in the CDR region, but also outperforms existing algorithms in docking. IgGM not only shows SOTA performance on conventional antibodies, but also performs well on nanobodies, further demonstrating the application value of IgGM."

However, the innovation in this part is not strong enough.\n2. The article did not elaborate on the introduction and explanation of the Inter chain Feature Embedding Module and Structure Encoder.\n3. In line 343, the authors define the success rate as DockQ > 0.23. The authors should either provide a reference to justify the selection of this threshold or elaborate on the rationale behind it.\n4. From the overall text, it appears that the length of the antibody CDR regions is also specified; however, the authors do not clarify this in the problem formulation."

Will the training data of ESM-PPI appear in the validation set of IgGM? Has this part been considered?\n3. As shown in Table 1, IgGM (AF3) uses the structure predicted by AF3 as the initial state. However, the authors do not clearly specify whether the sequence input to AF3 is the ground truth sequence. If it is, this would indirectly leak the answer, leading to inflated metrics for both the subsequent structures and sequences. A more rigorous approach would be to use 'initial state sequence + AF3 (random initial state sequence)' instead of 'random initial state sequence + AF3 (ground truth sequence)'"

                "value": "1. In line 278, the probabilities of 4:2:2:2 are assigned to the model to design CDR H3, CDR H, and all CDR. So, do you mean CDR-H3 only for 4/10, all CDR-Hs for 2/10, and all CDRs for 2/10 ?\n\n2. I am confused as to why you ultimately trained a consistency model. I comprehend that the key advantage of a consistency model lies in accelerating the generation process, enabling completion in fewer steps. However, in a scientific problem such as antibody design, is acceleration truly significant? Related to this, you have employed 10 different sampling steps in the appendix, but aside from the success rate (SR), the other four metrics seem to decline with the increase in the number of steps. Even SR shows a decline after surpassing 10 steps. These experimental results differ from what we might anticipate; I would appreciate a detailed study and explanation. Additionally, how does the original model perform without using the consistency model?\n\n3. Some physical metrics (like energy) are needed for a more refined evaluation. \n\n4. The model name (DiffIg) in Figure 4 has not been updated. \n\n5. The experiment in Section 4.2 seems to be the most important one in this paper, but I am somewhat unclear about the experimental setup here.\n  \n    5.1. 'Structure prediction\u21d2docking\u21d2CDR generation\u21d2side-chain packing' is not the process of dyMEAN. On the contrary, this is the 'Existing Works Pipeline' shown in Figure 1 to highlight the end-to-end approach of dyMEAN.\n  \n    5.2. In the stage of structure prediction, how is the sequence of the CDR part defined? Are random sequences used, or are special symbols like [MASK] employed?\n  \n    5.3. The AAR of dyMEAN on CDR-H3 is much lower than reported in the literature. Although the training and test data used in this paper differ from the original dyMEAN article, such a significant disparity needs to be explained (43.65%->29.4%).\n  \n    5.4. In both Section 4.1 and 4.2, there is a version of IgGM that uses AF3-predicted structures for initialization, making the prior distribution inconsistent with N(0, I). How does IgGM predict the structure in this scenario? Was an additional IgGM trained with AF3 predicted structures as prior? If it's the latter, how were the noise addition and denoising processes conducted?\"\n\n6. Finally, for any researcher working on AI-driven antibody design, aligning in silico evaluation with wet-lab experimental results is an essential consideration. Unfortunately, I did not find any discussion related to this in the main paper. If IgGM were to be eventually validated experimentally, do you believe the advantages of IgGM over other methods would still persist? Also, what improvements could be made?"

One major limitation is that the generation of antibodies depends on their framework regions, which predetermine the length of CDRs and may not always be available when handling a new antigen. Since the optimal CDR lengths are not known a priori, the authors should demonstrate the capability of IgGM in designing antibodies with varying CDR lengths.\n\n2. However, in line 147, the authors state that their method \"...enables the design of the whole antibody structure even without experimental structures.\" This claim requires clarification, as the results presented only demonstrate the ability to design CDRs.\n\n3. I suggest that the authors should compare their method with other antibody deisgn methods, such as:\n - Co-design models: AbX [1] (very similar framework with IgGM)\n - Structure-only models: RFdiffusion for antibody design [2]\n - Sequence-only models: AbLang [3] and IgLM [4]\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1.
