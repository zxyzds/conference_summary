    "title": "Neighbor-aware Geodesic Transportation for Neighborhood Refinery",
    "abstract": "Neighborhood refinery aims to enhance the neighbor relationships by refining the original distance matrix to ensure pairwise consistency.\nTraditional context-based methods, which encode instances alongside their local neighbors in a contextual affinity space, are limited in capturing global relationships and are vulnerable to the negative impacts of outliers in the neighborhood. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Neighbor-aware Geodesic Transportation (NGT) for the neighborhood refinery. NGT first constructs a global-aware distribution for each instance, capturing the intrinsic manifold relationships among all instances. This is followed by an optimization transportation process that utilizes the global-aware distribution within the underlying manifold, incorporating global geometric spatial information to generate a refined distance. NGT first involves Manifold-aware Neighbor Encoding (MNE) to project each instance into a global-aware distribution by constraining pairwise similarity with the corresponding affinity graph to capture global relationships. Subsequently, a Regularized Barycenter Refinery (RBR) module is proposed to integrate local neighbors into a barycenter, employing a Wasserstein term to reduce the influence of outliers. Lastly, Geodesic Transportation (GT) leverages geometric and global context information to transport the barycenter distribution along the geodesic paths within the affinity graph. Extensive evaluations on several tasks, such as re-ranking and deep clustering, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed NGT.",

The proposed modules Regularized Barycenter Refinery and Geodesic Transportation provide theoretical innovations for solving previous problems. At the same time, a large number of experimental results on re-ranking and deep clustering also provide empirical support. Overall, although the idea is simple and clear, it is indeed effective and provides new insights for subsequent research."

                "value": "a. Many techniques actually have been proposed and the proposed model seems a combinations of existing methods. For instance, in the Manifold-aware Neighbor Encoding, the authors utilize a Gaussian kernel to construct a manifold-aware space, differing from the traditional use of Euclidean distance to create a Euclidean space. This mapping approach to a nonlinear space is actually a typical technique in spectral clustering. Furthermore, both the neighbor search method in Eq. (3) and the bidirectional similarity diffusion in Eq. (4) are common practices in prior research. Thus, the paper presents limited novel insights.\n\nb. The authors introduce a Regularized Barycenter Refinement module aimed at enhancing robustness against outliers. However, Eq. (6) combines the Euclidean and Wasserstein distances. It\u2019s worth noting that Euclidean distance is inherently sensitive to outliers, making this choice potentially questionable for addressing this issue. It seems that this approach is primarily driven by optimization convenience rather than a robust outlier solution.\n\nc. The third module, as claimed by the authors, uses an existing technique to compute the shortest path in an affinity graph. Consequently, the three primary modules in this work are largely based on established methods.\n\nd. While the authors aim to address robustness to outliers, they do not provide any visual or convincing evidence to support their claims regarding this issue.\n\ne. The authors assert that their approach captures global relationships; however, the techniques employed are still grounded in conventional methods that calculate pairwise affinity weights. Additionally, the lack of visual evidence or further analysis undermines this claim, making it unconvincing.\n\nf. Key experimental details are missing. Firstly, none of the results include standard deviations, which is crucial given the sensitivity of deep learning models to seed selection. Secondly, despite the model\u2019s strict analysis and explicit formulation, the authors do not provide convergence analysis and empirical validation, which is an important omission."
