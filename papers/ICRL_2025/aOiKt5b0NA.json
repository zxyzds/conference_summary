    "title": "Salvador Urban Network Transportation (SUNT): A Landmark Spatiotemporal Dataset for Public Transportation",
    "abstract": "Efficient public transportation management is essential for the development of large urban centers, providing several benefits such as comprehensive coverage of population mobility, improvement of the local economy with the offer of new jobs and the decrease of transport costs, better control of traffic congestion, and significant reduction of environmental impact limiting gas emissions and pollution. Realizing these benefits requires carefully pursuing two essential pathways: (i) deeply understanding the population and transit patterns and (ii) using intelligent approaches to model multiple relations and characteristics efficiently. This work addresses these challenges by providing a novel dataset that includes various public transportation components alongside machine learning models trained to understand and predict different real-world behaviors. Our dataset comprises daily information from about 710,000 passengers in Salvador, one of Brazil's largest cities, and local public transportation data with approximately 2,000 vehicles operating across nearly 400 lines, connecting almost 3,000 stops and stations. As benchmarks, we have fine-tuned diverse Graph Neural Networks to perform inference on vertices and edges, undertaking both regression and classification tasks. These models leverage temporal and spatial features concerning passengers and transportation data. We emphasize the greatest advantage of using our dataset lies in different possibilities of modeling a real-world urban mobility dataset, reproducing our results, overcoming our models, and investigating several other open-problem situations listed in this manuscript as future work, which include the designing of new methods, optimization strategies, and environmental approaches. Our dataset, codes, and models are available at https://github.com/suntdataset/sunt.git.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Limited comparison to existing datasets:\nThe authors mention several existing transportation datasets (e.g., TaxiBJ, BikeNYC, METR-LA) but don't provide a detailed comparison of SUNT's features and capabilities relative to these datasets. A table comparing key attributes (e.g., data types, temporal/spatial resolution, coverage) would help readers understand SUNT's unique contributions and advantages.\n\n2. Lack of error analysis in data processing:\nThe paper describes a complex process for inferring passenger alighting locations, but doesn't provide an analysis of potential errors or biases introduced by this method. An evaluation of the accuracy of these inferences, perhaps through a small-scale validation study, would strengthen confidence in the dataset's quality.\n\n3. Limited exploration of temporal aspects:\nWhile the dataset includes 5 months of data, the benchmarking experiments focus on only a few specific days. A more comprehensive analysis exploring temporal patterns (e.g., weekday vs. weekend, seasonal variations) would better demonstrate the dataset's potential for longitudinal studies.\n\n4. Narrow range of benchmark tasks:\nThe benchmarking focuses on three tasks (node classification, edge classification, node regression). Expanding this to include tasks more directly relevant to transportation planning (e.g., demand prediction, route optimization) would better showcase the dataset's practical utility.\n\n5. Lack of multi-modal analysis:\nAlthough the dataset includes information from buses, BRT, and subway systems, the benchmarks don't explicitly demonstrate how these different modes can be analyzed together. Showcasing multi-modal analyses would highlight a key strength of the dataset.\n\n6. Limited discussion of privacy considerations:\nWhile the paper mentions that privacy was respected in data collection, there's little discussion of potential re-identification risks or mitigation strategies employed in the public release of the dataset.\n\n7. Absence of qualitative insights:\nThe paper focuses heavily on quantitative benchmarks but doesn't provide qualitative insights into transportation patterns or urban dynamics that the dataset reveals. Including some case studies or visualizations of interesting patterns would make the paper more compelling to transportation planners and policymakers.\n\n8. Lack of scalability analysis:\nGiven the large scale of the dataset, an analysis of computational requirements for processing and analyzing the full dataset would be valuable for researchers planning to use it.\n\n9. Limited discussion of data quality and potential biases:\nWhile the paper describes the data collection process, it doesn't deeply address potential biases or quality issues in the raw data sources (e.g., GPS errors, fare evasion)."

Considering the fast development in the spatiotemporal AI domain, it would be more convincing to include more recent methods.\n- For the first node classification task, all the methods performed pretty well.
