    "abstract": "The foreign exchange market, with its daily trading volume reaching nearly trillions of dollars, presents significant opportunities for the application of advanced predictive analytics. Traditional exchange rate forecasting methods often overlook the interdependencies between currencies and struggle with long-range data dependencies, leading to challenges in capturing the true market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network with Hierarchical Transformer (STGAT). Our model innovatively combines spatial graph convolutions with a dual-view temporal transformer-based mechanism, utilizing a Temporal Linearity Graph Attention Network (TLGAT) to account for currency relations in a time-sensitive manner. By integrating a linear attention mechanism for enhanced efficiency and capturing both local and global sequential data embeddings, STGAT provides a framework based on a hierarchical transformer for predicting exchange rates. We validate our approach on exchange rates of seventeen currencies over 2,092 trading days, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",

Without demonstrating superior performance on commonly used datasets such as ETTh, electricity, or traffic data, it is difficult to find the approach convincing.\n\n3.The experimental results in Table 1 appear quite weak, with many models showing R\u00b2 values below zero, meaning they perform worse than simple mean prediction. This suggests the authors may not have given adequate attention to data normalization or baseline parameter tuning.\n\n4.
