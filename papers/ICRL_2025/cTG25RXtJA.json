    "title": "KEEP: Towards a Knowledge-Enhanced Explainable Prompting Framework for Vision-Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) embedded with expansive representations and visual concepts have showcased significant potential in the computer vision community. Efficiently adapting VLMs such as CLIP, to downstream tasks has garnered growing attention, with prompt learning emerging as a representative approach. However, most existing prompt-based adaptation methods, which rely solely on coarse-grained textual prompts, suffer from limited performance and interpretability when handling tasks that require domain-specific knowledge. This results in a failure to satisfy the stringent trustworthiness requirements of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in high-risk scenarios like healthcare. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Explainable Prompting (KEEP) framework that leverages fine-grained domain-specific knowledge to enhance the adaptation process across various domains, facilitating bridging the gap between the general domain and other specific domains. We present to our best knowledge the first work to incorporate retrieval augmented generation and domain-specific foundation models to provide more reliable image-wise knowledge for prompt learning in various domains, alleviating the lack of fine-grained annotations, while offering both visual and textual explanations. Extensive experiments and explainability analyses conducted on eight datasets of different domains, demonstrate that our method simultaneously achieves superior performance and interpretability, shedding light on the effectiveness of the collaboration between foundation models and XAI. The code will be made publically available.",

                "value": "This paper introduces the Knowledge-Enhanced Explainable Prompting (KEEP) framework, designed to improve the adaptability and interpretability of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for domain-specific tasks. Traditional prompt-based methods often rely on general, coarse-grained textual prompts, limiting their performance and interpretability, especially in critical fields like healthcare that require high levels of trustworthiness in Explainable AI (XAI). KEEP addresses this limitation by integrating fine-grained, domain-specific knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and specialized foundation models, enhancing the relevance of prompts for specific domains. This approach enables more reliable and informative image-wise explanations and outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability. Experiments across eight diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of this framework, highlighting the beneficial synergy between foundation models and XAI."

In particular, it takes advantage of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to query knowledge from external datasets, and generate the image-wise prompt by comparing the knowledge and image embeddings. The prompts and images are then jointly utilized in a model trained with contrastive and standard classification objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method among multiple datasets, and validate the usefulness of domain knowledge."

                "value": "(1) Despite the emphasis on integrating domain knowledge specific to each sample, there is no quantitative evaluation of the relevance of extracted knowledge. This is particularly important considering that many of the applications in the paper involve high-stakes decisions (e.g., clinical diagnosis) and LLMs can potentially suffer from hallucination. It is necessary to perform a user study with domain experts or evaluate with ground truth annotations (e.g., comparing the similarity between generated prompts with clinical reports [ref1]). \n\n(2) Related to the previous comments. Looking at the results in Figure 4, it appears that the proposed knowledge is only marginally better than random knowledge in terms of faithfulness, and altering the knowledge prompts leads to negligible changes to the model performance. This is relatively worrisome, as it indicates that the validity of knowledge has limited effects on the model behaviors. \n\n(3) The paper only compares with general prompting methods that do not have access to domain knowledge, and it is unclear how advantageous is the proposed method in specific domains. It is reasonable to include state-of-the-art methods of the corresponding datasets in Table 1 (e.g., Derm7pt, Pneumonia, etc.)\n\n(4) The authors claim that cross-attention is used to provide sub-region explanations. However, the method utilizes a standard instance-wise contrastive objective without explicitly considering the spatial dimension. No evidence is provided to validate how such a paradigm helps address the issue. \n\n(5)  Figure 5 visualizes the gradient-based saliency maps of several examples. Nevertheless, since gradient-based approaches can have mixed explainability [ref2], it would be helpful to further consider other explainable AI methods, e.g., [ref3, ref4].\n\n(6) The authors argue that the proposed method is the first framework for generating instance-wise prompts with domain knowledge. Nevertheless, similar problems have been explored before (e.g., [ref5, ref6]), which also leverages LLMs and contrastive learning.\n\nReferences\n\n[ref1] Exploring the Boundaries of GPT-4 in Radiology.

Though the authors claim that the methods are leveraged in various domains, the paper only implements their methods in natural and medical imagery, where natural images are the main focus domain of existing VLMs. Thus, the only experimental domain to support the VLM adaption in this paper is the medical domain, which might not be enough to support the validation of the proposed method.\n\n2. As the authors provide better text prompts as domain-specific knowledge, the solo better text prompt should be ablatively studied.\n\n3. Since you already leverage the BiomedCLIP to provide domain-specific knowledge, why you do not directly prompt the BiomedCLIP yet still prompt the natural vision-based CLIP? \n\n4. Existing methods are still cornered in the natural vision, which is not really changing the domain gap of CLIP.\n\n5. Actually, this method is not the first attempt to achieve the domain adaption of CLIP, yet the compared methods are only the traditional natural-vision based prompt learning method. More recent methods with regard to domain prompt learning like [1,2] should be added to make a fair comparison. \n\n[1] Domain-controlled prompt learning\n\n[2] Domain prompt learning with quaternion networks"
