    "title": "Generating Freeform Endoskeletal Robots",
    "abstract": "The automatic design of embodied agents (e.g. robots) has existed for 31 years and is experiencing a renaissance of interest in the literature. To date however, the field has remained narrowly focused on two kinds of anatomically simple robots: (1) fully rigid, jointed bodies; and (2) fully soft, jointless bodies. Here we bridge these two extremes with the open ended creation of terrestrial endoskeletal robots: deformable soft bodies that leverage jointed internal skeletons to move efficiently across land. Simultaneous de novo generation of external and internal structures is achieved by (i) modeling 3D endoskeletal body plans as integrated collections of elastic and rigid cells that directly attach to form soft tissues anchored to compound rigid bodies; (ii) encoding these discrete mechanical subsystems into a continuous yet coherent latent embedding; (iii) optimizing the sensorimotor coordination of each decoded design using model-free reinforcement learning; and (iv) navigating this smooth yet highly non-convex latent manifold using evolutionary strategies. This yields an endless stream of novel species of ``higher robots'' that, like all higher animals, harness the mechanical advantages of both elastic tissues and skeletal levers for terrestrial travel. It also provides a plug-and-play experimental platform for benchmarking evolutionary design and representation learning algorithms in complex hierarchical embodied systems.",

                "value": "This work proposes (1) a simulation framework, (2) a generative model, and (3) a co-optimization procedure for endoskeletal robots that consist of both rigid bones and soft tissue, in contrast to rigid-only or soft-only bodies in many previous works. (1) The endoskeletal robots are simulated as a collection of elastic and rigid voxels in a 3D space, with type-specific constraint forces between them. (2) The learning-based generative model is trained by autoencoding a large dataset of synthetic training data (valid voxelized body plans) into a latent space. After training, the decoder generates voxelized body plans from this latent space, which are post-processed into a graph structure defining a simulated robot body. (3) The co-optimization procedure uses two nested training loops, in which the outer \"evolutionary\" loop searches through the latent space with CMA-ES to design better morphology, and the inner \"lifetime\" loop learns a reused actor/critic architecture with PPO to control an arbitrary morphology on control tasks. The agent is rewarded for forward locomotion across a variety of terrains."

The manuscript provides an extensive related works section for situating this work within the field, which was helpful.\n\n**S2: Clarity.** The manuscript was a pleasure to read. The writing is clear and concise, with appropriate details provided in the extensive appendices. The mathematical notation is simple and consistent. The figures are thoughtfully designed. Overall, great work!\n\n**S3: Quality.** The methods are appropriately applied, and the experimental results are technically sound and informative (especially with the ablations).\n\nOverall, I believe this is a solid work which I will recommend acceptance of, provided that my feedback below is adequately addressed."

Currently, the reward values aren't contextualized, so it's had to tell if the behavior is actually good, only that it's improving.\n\n**W3: Ablation of discrete action space.** It would be useful to show the comparison of discrete vs continuous action space (line 310), and provide some discussion. Is this a constraint from your simulation, or a learning issue? Wouldn't PPO also be able to control continuous action spaces, as it does in other related sim works?\n\n**W4: Minor figure/text edits.**\n- Figure 2 has nice aesthetics, but could be simplified. It has a lot of extraneous subpanel labels that aren't useful (Figure 5 too). Really the figure has 3 columns (initial, training, final), and the rows are instances of the same population. This message could be highlighted with in-figure annotations, like an arrow indicating the direction of training time.\n- Figure 1 looks pretty, but what is its purpose? It looks like a bunch of molecules floating on a dark ocean, which was confusing as it primed me to think about fluid simulations, (but the sim only works on terrestrial envs, line 533). Also, the entire caption is one really loong sentence.\n- Typos: line 376 sampled, line 398 the the, Fig 7 subpanel A label, Equation 10 star misplaced"
