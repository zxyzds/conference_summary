    "title": "DiffPath: Generating Road Network based Path with Latent Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "With the increasing use of GPS technology, path has become essential for applications such as navigation, urban planning, and traffic optimization. However, obtaining real-world path presents challenges due to privacy concerns and the difficulty of collecting large datasets. Existing methods, including count-based and deep learning approaches, struggle with two main challenges: handling complex distributions of path segments and ensuring global coherence in generated paths. To address these, we introduce DiffPath, a path generation model based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). By embedding path into a continuous latent space and leveraging a transformer architecture, DiffPath captures both local transitions and global dependencies, ensuring the generation of realistic paths. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing approaches in generating paths that adhere to real-world road network structures while maintaining privacy.",

                "value": "This paper introduces DiffPath, a path generation model that uses a latent diffusion model (LDM) and a transformer to generate realistic synthetic road paths, addressing privacy concerns and data limitations in urban navigation and planning. DiffPath embeds discrete paths into a continuous latent space, allowing it to capture complex path distributions and ensuring coherence between adjacent and distant road segments. By incorporating a customized loss function, the model aims to generate paths with rare segments often missed by traditional methods. Experimental results on datasets from Chengdu and Xi\u2019an show that DiffPath outperforms existing approaches in generating synthetic paths that align well with real-world road networks."

In related studies, the assumption of maintaining symmetry in the adjacency matrix of existing diffusion models may inaccurately represent one-way streets as bidirectional. This warrants a more in-depth discussion, as directed graphs do not necessarily require a symmetric structure in their adjacency matrices.  \nW3. The legend does not correspond with the paper's description; please verify the relationship between paths P1 and P2 in Figure 2 and the accuracy of the related statement in line 64.  \nW4. The ablation study analyzes replacing the Transformer with UNet but lacks a thorough analysis of the Diffusion module.  \nW5. No reproducible code is provided, making it impossible to verify the validity of the research findings."

More justification is needed to demonstrate that the generated path adheres to the constraints of the road network to substantiate this challenge.  \nQ2. Diffusion-based models typically exhibit high complexity; how does the computational complexity of DiffPath compare to the baseline?"

Besides, it is also unclear how this study addresses the claimed challenge.\n2. The novelty is limited compared with the previously proposed diffusion based trajectory generation method[1,2]. The difference between this study and the previous one is only that this study adopts transformer architecture. Moreover, how do this study ensure topology constraint during path generation is not convincing. They proposed to clamp the predicted latent state to the nearest valid road segment embedding. How can generation convergence is guaranteed under this kind of operation? Besides, this operation is not theoretically guaranteed to meet the topology constraint.\n3. The experimental studies are not sufficient, for example, they don\u2019t compare with other diffusion-based trajectory generation methods [1,2].\n\n[1] Zhu Y, Yu J J, Zhao X, et al.
