    "title": "CO-MOT: Boosting End-to-end Transformer-based Multi-Object Tracking via Coopetition Label Assignment and Shadow Sets",
    "abstract": "Existing end-to-end Multi-Object Tracking (e2e-MOT) methods have not surpassed non-end-to-end tracking-by-detection methods. One potential reason is its label assignment strategy during training that consistently binds the tracked objects with tracking queries and then assigns the few newborns to detection queries. With one-to-one bipartite matching, such an assignment will yield an unbalanced training, \\textit{i.e.}, scarce positive samples for detection queries, especially for an enclosed scene, as the majority of the newborns come on stage at the beginning of videos. Thus, e2e-MOT will be easier to yield a tracking terminal without renewal or re-initialization, compared to other tracking-by-detection methods. To alleviate this problem, we present Co-MOT, a simple and effective method to facilitate e2e-MOT by a novel coopetition label assignment with a shadow concept. Specifically, we add tracked objects to the matching targets for detection queries when performing the label assignment for training the intermediate decoders. For query initialization, we expand each query by a set of shadow counterparts with limited disturbance to itself. With extensive ablations, Co-MOT achieves superior performance without extra costs, \\textit{e.g.}, 69.4\\% HOTA on DanceTrack and 52.8\\% TETA on BDD100K. Impressively, Co-MOT only requires 38\\% FLOPs of MOTRv2 to attain a similar performance, resulting in the 1.4$\\times$ faster inference speed. Codes are attached for re-implementation.",

                "value": "The paper tackles end-to-end Transformer-based multiple-object tracking. Previous methods, such as TrackFormer and MOTR, face issues with imbalanced distribution in detection and tracking label assignments, where most objects are assigned to track queries, leaving only a few \u201cnewborns\u201d for detection queries. This joint training approach results in weaker detection performance compared to tracking-by-detection methods. To resolve this, the paper proposes a coopetition label assignment strategy to re-balance assignments between track and detection queries. Additionally, it introduces a shadow set that changes the original one-to-one mapping in DETR to a one-to-set mapping, further enhancing tracking performance. Results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.\u200b"

                "value": "1. To solve the issue of disproportional assignment of track and detection queries, there are also other simpler alternatives. A straightforward option would be to train detection queries jointly on image detection datasets alongside video tracking datasets. For example, detection queries could be trained exclusively on image datasets, treating every object as a new object. An ablation study comparing proposed methods to this simple joint training alternative is appreciated.\n\n2. The paper uses the first 5 decoders to train with all queries, while the last one trains separately on detection and tracking queries. An ablation study could clarify whether a different arrangement, such as using the first decoder for track queries and the last five for all queries, would impact performance. An ablation study regarding this would be helpful for readers to understand the optimal configuration.\n\n3. The applicability of the coopetition label assignment strategy is mostly limited to cases where there is more video data than image data for training, leading to an imbalance in track and detection query assignments. However, in many practical settings, the opposite is true\u2014large-scale [1] and open-vocabulary MOT tasks [2] often have substantially more image detection data than video tracking data. In these cases, common practice in MOT is to use joint training with both image and tracking data, which provides sufficient supervision for detection queries. This is contrary to the paper\u2019s analysis, and it would be beneficial for the authors to also at least discuss these more common scenarios.\n\n[1] Li, Siyuan, et al. \"Matching Anything by Segmenting Anything.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.\n\n[2] Li, Siyuan, et al. \"Ovtrack: Open-vocabulary multiple object tracking.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2023."

Coopetition Label Assignment (COLA) revises label assignment by allowing detection queries to utilize tracked objects during training in intermediate decoders. This approach boosts feature augmentation for tracking objects with diverse appearances and alleviates the issue of tracking termination. Shadow Set Strategy aims to address training imbalance in one-to-one matching, CO-MOT introduces \"shadow sets,\" which add slight disturbances to each query, thus allowing one-to-set matching. This enhances the discriminative training process and the model's generalization.The proposed method outperforms existing e2e-MOT models on benchmarks like DanceTrack and BDD100K with improved tracking metrics such as HOTA and TETA, demonstrating higher efficiency and inference speed."

In the experiments section, the authors need to include comparisons with more methods on the MOT20 and BDD100K datasets.\n\n3. Since the authors analyze the impact of tracking queries on detection performance in transformer-based trackers, if this point serves as one of the motivations, they should compare whether the proposed framework shows improvement in mAP in the experiments.\n\n4.

Notably, Fig.4 in the manuscript only presents the Flops, which is not the actual training and inference time. Intuitively, more object queries would bring larger computation costs. Why do shadow sets not?\n\n\n- Although the proposed method demonstrates strong performance on the tested datasets, it would be advantageous to evaluate CO-MOT on MOT20. The authors assert that the proposed approach enhances detection recall. Thus, the more densely populated nature of MOT20 provides a more suitable context for assessing the effectiveness of the model.\n\n- The authors should investigate the sensitivity of the proposed method to hyperparameters, such as the number of shadow sets and the parameters of the coopetition label assignment strategy. Understanding how these hyperparameters affect performance would provide valuable insights for practical implementation.\n\n- The writing should be improved. For instance, in Fig.3 and Fig.4, the axis titles are overlapped with the axis. The readability of Figures 3 and 4 could be improved by adjusting the axis labels to avoid overlap.
