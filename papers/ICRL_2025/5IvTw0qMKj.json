    "title": "C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention",
    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting.\nComparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.",

                "value": "The paper introduces C2INet, a novel model designed to enhance multi-agent trajectory prediction in dynamic environments by addressing key challenges like environmental bias and catastrophic forgetting. C2INet incorporates a prior-aware memory module that stores optimal priors across tasks, enabling it to adapt incrementally to new scenarios while retaining performance on past tasks. A core component of the model is the continual causal intervention mechanism, which aims to disentangle latent confounding factors that could negatively impact prediction accuracy.\n\nThe model's design emphasizes a balance between computational efficiency and performance, employing variational inference to align environment-dependent priors with posterior estimates, thus maintaining robustness against latent biases. The inclusion of a pseudo-feature-based pruning strategy ensures the memory module remains efficient and manageable even as task volume increases. C2INet's framework is evaluated on datasets such as ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone, showcasing its strong adaptability and significant improvements in prediction metrics like Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) when compared to traditional trajectory prediction models."

Innovative Design:\nThe paper introduces a novel model, C2INet, which combines causal intervention with continual learning, specifically using a memory module to retain optimal priors across different scenarios to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

This design enhances the model's adaptability to dynamic environments, making it suitable for multi-agent trajectory prediction in complex settings, such as autonomous driving and crowd monitoring.\n\n3. Potential Limitations of the Prior Memory Module:\nAlthough the prior memory module helps alleviate catastrophic forgetting, it heavily relies on storing priors for different tasks, which may lead to challenges in memory management and capacity. As the number of tasks grows, the memory module might struggle to scale efficiently. Additionally, the paper does not discuss how to effectively manage priority or memory compression when storage space is limited.\n\n4. Limitations of the Experimental Datasets:\nAlthough the paper uses multiple datasets, these are mainly focused on specific domains (e.g., pedestrian and vehicle trajectory prediction) and lack diversity. The generalizability of the experimental results to more complex or diverse dynamic environments is unclear, limiting the method\u2019s applicability to real-world scenarios.\n\n5. Complex Hyperparameter Tuning with Limited Guidance:\nC2INet involves multiple key hyperparameters (e.g., the KL divergence adjustment coefficient, weights in the memory module) that significantly affect model performance, but the paper does not provide detailed guidance on tuning them. The complexity of hyperparameter tuning, combined with a lack of explicit guidelines, may hinder other researchers from reproducing and applying the method in different settings."
