    "title": "TetSphere Splatting: Representing High-Quality Geometry with Lagrangian Volumetric Meshes",
    "abstract": "We introduce TetSphere Splatting, a Lagrangian geometry representation designed for high-quality 3D shape modeling. TetSphere splatting leverages an underused yet powerful geometric primitive -- volumetric tetrahedral meshes. It represents 3D shapes by deforming a collection of tetrahedral spheres, with geometric regularizations and constraints that effectively resolve common mesh issues such as irregular triangles, non-manifoldness, and floating artifacts. Experimental results on multi-view and single-view reconstruction highlight TetSphere splatting's superior mesh quality while maintaining competitive reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TetSphere splatting demonstrates versatility by seamlessly integrating into generative modeling tasks, such as image-to-3D and text-to-3D generation.",

                "value": "1. My main concern with the paper is its novelty and contribution: the paper essentially proposes to deform a mesh w.r.t a visual loss which is standard (e.g., [Nicloet et al. 2021]), while using two standard regularizes to guarantee a \"good\" deformation (smooth and without inversions). This is a very standard approach. The only part that seems less explored is the use of tetrahedra instead of triangles, however this of course has been explored extensively outside of the context of differentiable rendering, hence the only part I can deem truly novel is \"using tetrahedra instead of triangles in tandem with multiview reconstruction\". This feels like a marginal contribution. It could be argued to be a very practical approach which may convince me to champion it, however that leads me to my second concern:\n2. Evaluation seems somewhat selective, and the methods compared to do not strike me as the immediate alternatives. Namely, I find [Nicolet et al. 2021] as a main contender, as well as \"Continuous remeshing for inverse rendering\" which is uncited. Many other techniques that cite [Nicolet et al. 2021] can be considered. \n3. The argumentation for the use of a volumetric mesh instead of a triangle mesh needs to be justified further through experiments. It seems the only argument for a full discretization of the *volume* (as opposed to the surface via a triangle mesh), is to regularize the volumetric deformation with the two losses. This seems like a significant overkill, as simpler regularizers could be employed on the triangle mesh (again, e.g., Nicolet et al. 2021) to ensure it behaves well."

                "value": "The paper proposes a shape reconstruction method that takes a set of images as input and fits a 3D model with reflectance properties to them. In line with a large body of recent work, it combines a rendering loss with shape regularization to directly optimize a 3D scene representation by \"simple\" numerical descent. The problem is particularly challenging as the paper uses a \"Lagrangian\" representation, specifically, a tetrahedral mesh that co-moves with the surface points obtained.\n\nAs recent work, such as [Nicolet 2021] has pointed out, the success of such an approach critically hinges upon suitable regularization, as the rendering loss is ambiguous and it is easy to get stuck in a bad local minimum with nonsensical mesh structures (which has been an issue for a long time in attempting such direct shape optimization against relatively weak data constraints).\n\nThe key contribution of this paper is to use a volumetric representation, a tet-mesh, with a penalty against inversion of elements along with an incrementally applied smoothness regularizer (a bi-harmonic energy applied to deformation gradients of the current mesh) that promotes changes in low-frequency shape first.\n\nThe paper provides very convincing results and shows a number of interesting applications, some of which only made it into the appendix."

                "value": "I think that the main strength of the paper is the idea itself: Regularization is important to avoid bad mesh structure, and a volumetric representation intuitively gives much more leeway to regularization over a pure thin-shell / surface model (the inductive bias of this being a solid is stronger than regularizing details on thin surface). The proposed setup with inversion constraints and smoothness looks plausible and seems to work very well in practice. I should add that I am not actively working in this area, so I might miss some related work; but if this kind of approach has not yet been tried, the approach itself seems worth publishing.\n\nThe results are also convincing in terms of quality and versatility. The paper is very well written, nicely illustrated and enjoyable to read. Comparisons against some related recent method also underline the quality of the results quantitatively."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In my opinion, the main downside is that the paper is rather light on analysis: Why does it use the bi-harmonic energy on deformation gradients? What does this actually mean (application to derivatives should create higher-order smoothness, or in terms of a Fourier-perspective, add an additional high-pass filter in front of the regularizer)? What happens, if other regularizers are used? How important is the non-inversion term, and how brittle are parameter choices? It would also be interesting to discuss the relation to other attempts at stricter regularization, such as Nilcolet et al.'s work. I would guess that the volumetric approach is strictly superior, if fully exploited; showing something like this experimentally would make the paper much stronger.\n\nSome of the limitations could also been discussed more clearly. For example, the paper only produces piecewise meshes, which are overlayed; it does not solve the problem of globally fitting a single tet-mesh. Comparisons in mesh quality should take this into account. Further, this also shows implicitly that the method is still to brittle to handle strong deformations during optimization; otherwise, one could just fit a single sphere globally. In this context, as well as in general, it would be instructive to show how to break the method by slowly stepping outside its \"convergence radius\" where good results can be obtained into cases where results are unsatisfactory. My criticism here is not that there are limitations but that the paper could be strengthened by studying them more in depth.\n\nFinally, the paper seems like a better fit to a conference on computer vision or graphics in terms of methods and problems, but I would consider the topic close enough not to exclude it."

If so, can you make a formal or experimental argument to convince the reader? If the differences are more nuanced, what are the key trade-offs one has to make here?"

The paper does not seem to mention how to extract the surface mesh from the tetrahedral mesh, which I think is also an important part of the whole pipeline.

If I understand correctly, this seems to be strongly related to \"silhouette coverage\", which must be consistent with the topology of GT. I would like to see an analysis of the Euler characteristic (Genus) in the tables.\n4. This paper introduces many metrics to evaluate the quality of the mesh, but no corresponding references or mathematical definitions are given, like Manifoldness Rate and Connected Component Discrepancy. I hope to see their mathematical definitions in the appendix, which will make it easier for readers to understand. \n5. Regarding mesh quality, first of all, do all compared methods have similar resolution/triangle numbers? If mesh quality is to be compared, giving the triangle numbers is a must. It would be great if the authors could provide a metric for triangle quality, such as the Edge Chamfer Distance in NMC [Chen and Zhang. 2021] and TriangleQ in CWF [Xu et al. 2024].\n6. In addition, since your initialization is multiple tetrahedralized spheres, what is the connection between the spheres? Are they multiple independent connected branches? If so, how to deal with the intersection between them, and how to ensure that the final mesh is an independent and connected one?\n7.
