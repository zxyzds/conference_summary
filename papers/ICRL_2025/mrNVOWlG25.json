    "title": "MotifDisco: Motif Causal Discovery For Time Series Motifs",
    "abstract": "Many time series, particularly health data streams, can be best understood as a sequence of phenomenon or events, which we call motifs. A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify causal relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (motif disco-very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of Motif Causality (MC), inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We also integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for other downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.",

                "value": "Thanks for your time and effort on this review. \n\nTechnical Novelty:  \nMotifDisco is the first framework to learn causal relationships amongst time series motifs, and there is no prior work solving this problem. In this context, Motif \u201cdiscovery\u201d of casuality refers to the process of identifying previously unknown causal relationships amongst a set of motifs. Lamp et al, 2024 solve a different problem (they are trying to generate synthetic data), quantify causality differently (i.e., using a different formulation) and the process they use to learn causality is complex, not interpretable and has issues with scalability. In addition, previous methods for causality in time series cannot be directly applied to learn causal relations amongst motifs because of one or more of the following issues:  \n-\tThey compose relations between only two time series, and cannot find relationships amongst a set of motifs or traces (Amornbunchornvej et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2023).  \n-\tThey formulate causality based on various statistical properties amongst variables- things like variable-based correlation and density-, classification- and prediction-based error measures between variables (Amornbunchornvej et al., 2021; Bonetti et al., 2024; Irribarra et al., 2024). These assumptions do not hold for univariate time series motifs.  \n-\tThey compose causal relationships over time series using repeated statistical measures or temporal dynamics \u2013 things like learning implicit repeated patterns, or computing sufficiency or faithfulness hypotheses over lags across the full time series (Sun et al., 2015; Assaad et al., 2021; L\u00f6we et al., 2022; Najafi et al., 2023; Lamp et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024). These methods do not work for motifs because they are short time series (so there would be no repeated patterns, nor will statistical hypotheses like sufficiency or faithfulness hold since they are not evaluating multiple time lags repeated over a trace.).   \n-\tThey require labels or a known underlying causal structure to guide model training (Gong et al., 2023; Najafi et al., 2023; Bonetti et al., 2024), which is not available for our data and many similar event-based data streams.  \n\nTo make this more clear, we have updated the Related work section to explicitly state this (see lines 122-128).\n\n\nExperimental Evaluation:  \nWhile we do agree that comparing with existing state of the art would make the paper stronger, unfortunately this is not possible because there is no prior work on quantifying causality amongst motifs. We cannot directly compare with prior Granger causal techniques because their framework set-up or model assumptions do not hold for univariate motifs (see more details in the related question previously about technical novelty).\n\nWe focused our evaluation to one domain (diabetes, using glucose traces) because this application is particularly well motivated to use and understand relationships amongst motifs. We selected this dataset because it contains a large set of glucose traces with high variability and motif representation amongst traces. Future work may investigate uses of MotifDisco on other health datasets.\n\nDetails about the base models used for each use case are provided in Section 5. Details about the dataset used are provided in Section 6 under Experimental Details. If there are additional questions related to use case model architectures or the dataset we are happy to answer them!"

                "value": "Thanks for your time and detailed review. \n\nMotif Construction (Weakness 1 and Question 1):  \nSince we wanted the focus of this paper to be on the formulation and development of the motif causality framework, motif extraction was outside the scope of the paper. That being said, as mentioned by the reviewer (and as also mentioned in our paper), more dynamic or intelligent motif extraction methods could definitely be used for motif extraction based on the desired use case (e.g., methods like Chinpattanakarn & Amornbunchornvej, 2024; Scha \u0308fer & Leser, 2022; Ye & Keogh, 2009). Our framework is amenable to any motif extraction method.  \n\nSince our framework finds relationships amongst predefined motifs, the results will look different if a different set of input motifs are given. We note that interesting causal relationships were found amongst motifs even when a simple motif extraction method was used, such as chopping.\n\nGraph Interpretability (Question 2):  \nInteresting question. It depends on the dataset, but for instance for the glucose traces the causal graph structure will get larger and more complex (e.g., because there may be more edges between more motifs) as the number of motifs increases, and the length of the motifs decreases. A way to balance this is through the edge prediction threshold, \\theta. For example, if you wanted a sparser graph that only contained the strongest causal relationships, you could set \\theta to a high value such as 0.8.\n\nGeneralizability (Question 3):  \nMotifDisco is very generalizable, because the framework does not make any glucose-specific assumptions in its preprocessing, learning or post-processing. The only constraint required by the framework is that you provide an input set of univariate time series traces and select its hyperparameters (including the motif length and the edge prediction threshold). Future work may directly investigate uses of MotifDisco on other health datasets.\n\nPersonalization (Weakness 2 and Question 4):  \nThis is an interesting point. The framework does not directly account for inter-individual variability, as it only learns causal relationships across the provided population of input motifs. One way to combat this would be to feed as input only traces from a single individual or from a specific sub-cohort or population, in order to force the framework to focus on understanding personalized causal relationships. This would be quite feasible to do in the diabetes space since glucose traces are typically collected continuously (i.e., every 5 minutes) and there may be months to even years of data per patient.\n\nRecognized Limitations of the Paper (Weakness 3 and 5):  \nThe reviewer makes valid points about these paper limitations, which we recognize ourselves and address explicitly in Section 7: Conclusion & Limitations. As mentioned in that section, there are many opportunities to further optimize our runtime (e.g., by parallelization). Also, although we do not have a causal ground truth to compare to, our framework performs well on the three use cases, which may provide some evidence that motif causality is useful for real world tasks.\n\nComparison to SOTA (Weakness 4):  \nPlease see our response to reviewer t5ma where we have given a longer response to this question. Succinctly, while we do agree that comparing with existing state of the art would make the paper stronger, unfortunately this is not possible because there is no prior work on quantifying causality amongst motifs. We cannot directly compare with prior Granger causal techniques because their framework set-up or model assumptions do not hold for univariate motifs. We have also clarified this in the Related Work section (see lines 122-128).\n\nClinical Validation (Weakness 6):  \nThe scope of this paper was focused on describing the theoretical development of the novel motif causality calculation and framework. However, this is a good point and clinical validation is actually the next phase of this project that we are currently working on."

As such, discussion about motif extraction methods and artifacts is outside the scope of the paper since the problem of how to extract motifs has been widely solved (e.g., there are many nice methods to pull out motifs in an intelligent manner, given some criteria, and specific to different disciplines, such as Chinpattanakarn & Amornbunchornvej, 2024; Scha \u0308fer & Leser, 2022; Ye & Keogh, 2009). Our framework is amenable to any motif extraction method, and, as evidenced by our results, works even when using simple or heuristic motif extraction methods, such as chopping. \n\nCapturing Time Occurrence & Frequency in Framework (Weakness 3):  \nRight, so an advantage of Granger Causality is that the model does not need explicit \u201cmetadata\u201d about motif temporality to still be able to learn causal relationships amongst data, which is one of the reasons we selected this as our base mathematical notion to build upon."

The segments are then embedded into graph node embeddings using GraphSage, a message passing graph neural network. These embeddings are then passed through a link prediction model that maximizes the probability of links with high transfer entropy (conditional entropy gain achieved through adding node i to the conditional to predict node j). This process is then repeated over multiple epochs of the training time series data to learn the graph where links are added iteratively. Subsequently, in each iteration, links are removed by computing the reverse edge graph and their corresponding link prediction probabilities. Finally, this motif causal network is used for time series prediction, anomaly detection and clustering."

This may lead to arbitrary definitions of motifs that do not always correspond to well-defined physiological phenomena. The authors could consider more dynamic motif extraction methods.\n2. Lack of Personalization: The majority strategy for causal inference used in the GNN might overlook personalized differences across individuals, which could limit the accuracy of BP estimation or understanding of other health parameters in highly diverse populations.\n3. No Ground Truth for Causal Evaluation: A notable limitation is the lack of ground truth causal structures for motifs, which makes the evaluation of the learned causal graphs challenging. Although indirect measures such as downstream task performance are used to validate the usefulness of the model, a more direct assessment of the accuracy of causal inference is missing.\\\n4. No comparison with SOTA: this paper does not provide an extensive, systematic comparison against other state-of-the-art causal discovery frameworks and deep learning methods for forecasting, anomaly detection, and clustering.\n5. Scalability Issues: The scalability analysis shows that training times grow significantly for large motif sets and numbers of traces. The current implementation may not be suitable for very large datasets, especially in real-time applications. Methods like parallelization for computing motif causality are suggested as improvements.\n6. Limited Clinical Validation: The evaluation was limited to glucose data, and the clinical significance of the discovered causal motifs is not thoroughly validated.
