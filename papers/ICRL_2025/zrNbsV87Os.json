    "title": "SSIF: Physics-Inspired Implicit Representations for Spatial-Spectral Image Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Existing digital sensors capture images at fixed spatial and spectral resolutions (e.g., RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral images), and generating super-resolution images with different resolution settings requires bespoke machine learning models. Spatial Implicit Functions (SIFs) partially overcome the spatial resolution challenge by representing an image in a spatial-resolution-independent way. However, they\nstill operate at fixed, pre-defined spectral resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose Spatial-Spectral Implicit Function (SSIF), a neural implicit model that represents an image as a function of both continuous pixel coordinates in the spatial domain and continuous wavelengths in the spectral domain. This continuous representation across spatial and spectral domains enables a single model to learn from a diverse set of resolution settings, which leads to better generalizability. This representation also allows the physical principle of spectral imaging and the spectral response functions of sensors to be easily incorporated during training and inference. Moreover, SSIF does not have the equal spectral wavelength interval requirement for both input and output images which leads to much better applicability. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of SSIF on two challenging spatial-spectral super-resolution benchmarks. We observe that SSIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even when the baselines are allowed to train separate models at each spatial or spectral resolution. We show that SSIF generalizes well to both unseen spatial and spectral resolutions. Moreover, due to its physics-inspired design, SSIF performs significantly better at low data regime and converges faster during training compared with other strong neural implicit function-based baselines.",

In summary, this paper presents impressive innovations and demonstrates substantial effort. However, *Issue 1* raise some doubts about the reliability of the experimental results. Moreover, since the performance in spectral super-resolution is more appealing, the related experiments need improvement (such as Issue 3). If the concerns I raised are addressed, I would consider raising the score."
