    "title": "Leveraging Implicit Sentiments: Enhancing Reliability and Validity in Psychological Trait Evaluation of LLMs",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing integration into human life. Understanding their inherent characteristics, such as personalities, temperaments, and emotions, is essential for responsible AI development. However, current psychometric evaluations of LLMs, often derived from human psychological assessments, encounter significant limitations in terms of reliability and validity. Test results reveal that models frequently refuse to provide anthropomorphic responses and exhibit inconsistent scores across various scenarios. Moreover, human-derived theories may not accurately predict model behavior in practical real-world applications.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Core Sentiment Inventory (CSI), a novel evaluation instrument inspired by the Implicit Association Test (IAT). CSI is built from the ground up with a significantly broader range of stimuli words than traditional assessments. CSI covers both English and Chinese to implicitly evaluate models\u2019 sentiment tendencies, which allows for a much more comprehensive assessment.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CSI effectively quantifies models\u2019 sentiments, revealing nuanced emotional patterns that vary significantly across languages and contexts. CSI significantly improves reliability, yielding more consistent results and a reduced reluctance rate, and enhances predictive power by effectively capturing models\u2019 emotional tendencies. These findings validate CSI as a robust and insightful tool for evaluating the psychological traits of LLMs, offering a more reliable alternative to traditional methods.",

                "value": "The paper introduces Core Sentiment Inventory (CSI), a multilingual evaluation benchmark aimed at assessing the sentiment tendencies of LLMs in an implicit manner. The approach leverages 5,000 neutral words from English and Chinese and prompts the LLM to express polarity towards these neutral words. By assessing this polarity, the paper measures the biases of the models with respect to optimism or pessimism. To quantify the reliability of CSI, the paper validates the method against BFI, where CSI shows significant decrease in reluctance (i.e., model punting)."

                "value": "Reasons to reject\n\nWhile the paper has merit, I see the some critical flaws presented below:\n\n- The decision to pick all top nouns/verbs is questionable to me. Yes, nouns and verbs \u201ctend\u201d to be neutral. However, this is not always the case. From the examples in Table 2, some of these words are clearly polarized. \u201cImprove\u201d has positive connotations, as well as \u201cteam\u201d. I believe there needs to be a manual filtering step where these words are removed to ensure reliable results. As it stands, I think the model does not have implicit biases if it assigns \u201cimprove\u201d as positive.\n- Design choices are not well-motivated. The approach does multiple predictions for the same word and the method shuffles the order of words to measure inconsistency. (1) Given this goal, why is temperature T set to 0? Wouldn\u2019t a higher temperature better indicate the model uncertainty in assigning tragedy/comedy? (2) Why is the number of words sampled equal to 30? What happens with n > 30 or n < 30. Why wasn\u2019t the number of words picked so it maximizes the context window?\n- The prompt design is biased. (3) Why is neutral not a valid option? A very strong model with perfect instruction following capabilities will always pick one of the two (comedy/tragedy) and will never output \u201cneutral\u201d. (4) Given the definition of neutral score as N_{inconsistent} / N, I am wondering what percentage of words the model predicted in opposite categories? I think they should be very few. In this case, neutral score is solely determined by poor instruction following, not implicit biases."
