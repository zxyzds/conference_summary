    "abstract": "Recent research into solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained significant traction, particularly through the application of deep (reinforcement) learning for end-to-end solution construction. However, many current construction-based neural solvers predominantly utilize Transformer architectures, which can face scalability challenges and struggle to produce diverse solutions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework beyond Transformer-based approaches, i.e., Adversarial Generative Flow Networks (AGFN). This framework integrates the generative flow network (GFlowNet)\u2014a probabilistic model inherently adept at generating diverse solutions (routes)\u2014with a complementary model for discriminating (or evaluating) the solutions. These models are trained alternately in an adversarial manner to improve the overall solution quality, followed by a proposed hybrid decoding method to construct the solution. We apply the AGFN framework to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and travelling salesman problem (TSP), and our experimental results demonstrate that AGFN surpasses the popular construction-based neural solvers, showcasing strong generalization capabilities on synthetic and real-world benchmark instances.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel neural solver for vehicle routing problems, specifically CVRP and TSP. It employs a generative flow network (GFlowNet) to learn a diverse set of potential solution trajectories to address the common challenge in VRP solvers of falling into locally optimal solution. The GFlowNet is trained in an adversarial manner where a discriminator is used to distinguish between the raw outputs of the network and their corresponding optimized trajectories obtained via local search techniques. To further balance the exploration and exploitation, the method uses a hybrid decoding strategy, similar to $\\epsilon$-greedy. Experimental results show that the proposed method generally outperforms existing baselines, especially on larger problem instances with higher numbers of nodes."
