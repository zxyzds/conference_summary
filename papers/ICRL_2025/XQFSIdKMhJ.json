    "title": "Using Generative AI to capture High Fidelity Temporal Dynamics to target Vehicular Systems",
    "abstract": "Generative models have transformed the creation of text, images, and video content by enabling machines to generate high-quality, realistic outputs. These models are now widely being adopted in advanced fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and media production. Since vehicle data is limited due to proprietary concerns, utilizing generative models to mimic complex vehicle behaviors would provide powerful tools for creating synthetic data that can serve as a crucial component for enhancing the fidelity of vehicle models, better predictive maintenance, more robust control systems, autonomous driving features and resilient defense mechanism against cyber threats. This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Conditional Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) model, which trains on limited available real vehicle data and is then able to generate synthetic time series data mimicking the actual vehicle data. The LSTM network helps in learning temporal characteristics of vehicle network traffic without needing the system details, which makes it applicable to wide range of vehicle networks. The conditional layer adds auxiliary information by labeling\ndata for different driving scenarios for training and generating data. The quality of the synthetic data is evaluated visually and quantitatively using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Predictive and Discriminative Scores. For demonstration purposes, the generative model is integrated into a validated vehicle model, where it successfully generates synthetic sensor feedback corresponding to the dynamic driving scenarios. This showcases the model\u2019s ability to simulate realistic sensor data in response to varying vehicle operations. Leveraging the high similarity to actual data, the generative model is further demonstrated for its potential use as malicious attack mechanism due to its deception capabilities against state of the art Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Without triggering the thresholds of the IDS, the model is able to penetrate the network stealthily with a low detection rate of 47.05%, compared to the 90% or higher detection rates of other known attacks. This effort is intended to serve as a test benchmark to develop more robust ML/AI based defense mechanisms.",

                "value": "I have the following major concerns on this paper:\n\n### Lack of discussion and evaluation of recent line of research in generative diffusion models\n\nThis paper should discuss and evaluate the recent generative models for automotive more clearly. This research is motivated by the limitation of existing works in high annotation cost of real-world data and incapability in covering edge cases like extreme weather or rare traffic events. These are the same motivations for the recent generative model works such as [a, b, c]. I can see that this work focuses on the sensor input generation rather than scenario generation, but scenario generation should be preferable as long as it is realistic since we still do not know what kind of driving scenario is required to reproduce the sensor input. To address these concerns, this paper should discuss the differences between their methods and these recent generative approaches and demonstrate their advantages quantitatively. At least, I want to know why this paper avoids even discussing such important prior work.\n\n[a] Hu, A., Russell, L., Yeo, H., Murez, Z., Fedoseev, G., Kendall, A., ... & Corrado, G. (2023).

Muvo: A multimodal generative world model for autonomous driving with geometric representations. arXiv e-prints, arXiv-2311.\n\n\n### Lack of sufficient evaluation of vehicular system data\n\nThis paper should provide a more sufficient evaluation of vehicular system data because the current evaluation does not answer if these signals are realizable in actual driving scenarios. Exploring edge cases is important, but edge cases are meaningless if they are not realizable. The current evaluations with MMD, DS, and PS do not give a good understanding of vehicle-level consequences. I understand that it may not always be possible to come up with actual driving scenarios, but, this paper should provide at least several use cases. Otherwise, this work cannot provide meaningful feedback to the developers.\n\n\n### Limited novelty in LSTM-based GAN model for generating time-series data\n\nAs this paper mentions, their methodology is highly inherited from Yoon et al. (2019), which originally proposed a time-series data generation with GAN and LSTM. Although the application to new areas can be seen as a contribution, it can only be seen as a minor contribution unless sufficient evaluation is provided to illustrate that the application brings significant improvements in the areas. If this paper intends to claim the novelty in their methodology, this paper should highlight their technical updates and their motivations for why these updates are necessary in this research."

I appreciate the authors input to bring cGAN to generate synthetic sensor data to facilitate autonomous driving, however, I have several concerns for this work:\n\n1.  In the introduction, the author claimed that \"there is a gaps in preparedness for edge cases like extreme weather or rare traffic events\", I was expected to see technique contribution and experimental efforts to collect data and resolve the problem, however, I was disappointed to find there is no such presentation in this work.\n\n2. The author overclaimed the contribution by stating generate multiple sensors data and even put a matrix to clarify the $X_{ij}$, however, I didn't find any contribution to enforce the generalization of generating multiple sensors data. In experiment, there is only one sensor data is synthesized, which is not aligned with the author's claim.\n\n3. I am actually quite confused about the setpoint setting, in the real world, there is no such command to set a discrete velocity, in stead, there is only involve driver's action like press the pedal or break, which should be continuous action with continuous feedback. Therefore, I am convinced by the usage of the model in the autonomous driving scenario.\n\n4. Fig. 5 is also confused to me, as the synthetic velocity always align with the set-point command and away from the normal velocity, how it is possible for a real car to have the speed like this (e.g., sudden speed drop)? And how this will contribute to the decision making of autonomous driving?\n\n5. There is no source code or demonstration to support this finding."

Autonomous vehicles rely on multiple sensors that operate under complex and varied conditions.
