    "title": "RankNovo: A Universal Reranking Approach for Robust De Novo Peptide Sequencing",
    "abstract": "De novo peptide sequencing is a critical task in proteomics research. However, the performance of current deep learning-based methods is limited by the inherent complexity of mass spectrometry data and the heterogeneous distribution of noise signals, leading to data-specific biases. We present RankNovo, the first deep reranking framework that enhances de novo peptide sequencing by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple sequencing models. RankNovo employs a list-wise reranking approach, modeling candidate peptides as multiple sequence alignments and utilizing axial attention to extract informative features across candidates. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics, PMD (Peptide Mass Deviation) and RMD (Residual Mass Deviation), which offer delicate supervision by quantifying mass differences between peptides at both the sequence and residue levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RankNovo not only surpasses its individual base models, which are used to generate training candidates for reranking pre-training, but also sets a new state-of-the-art de novo sequencing benchmarks. Moreover, RankNovo exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen models\u2014those whose generations were not exposed during training, highlighting its robustness and potential as a universal reranking framework for peptide sequencing. Our work presents a novel reranking strategy that fundamentally challenges existing single-model paradigms and advances the frontier of accurate de novo peptide sequencing.

                "value": "1. The performance improvement seems modest. RankNovo's peptide recall only surpasses the baseline by 0.037 (V1) and 0.023 (V2). Since RankNovo is trained and inferred based on these base models, it theoretically can only outperform them. The evaluation of RankNovo's performance should be based on its improvement relative to SOTA baselines. Otherwise, for such minor improvements, why not simply use the predictions from other models instead of inference multiple models through RankNovo?\n\n2. There seems to be a lack of analysis regarding the parameter number, training time, and inference time of RankNovo compared to other de novo models, which should be addressed in the experimental section. Given that RankNovo requires inference results from multiple (2 to 6) other models during training and inference, it can be inferred that its training and inference times would be slower than those of other models."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The definition of robustness in the paper seems somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, it appears to refer to the model's robustness to noise in mass spectrometry data (Lines 12\u201314, Lines 81\u201384), but RankNovo might not sufficient to address this issue. On the other hand, it seems to refer to the issue of having inconsistent baseline models available during training and testing phases.\n\n\n2. Based on the disadvantage mentioned earlier regarding modest performance improvement, there should be experiments to demonstrate whether naive methods (instead of RankNovo) can also achieve reasonable results. For instance, during inference, for multiple predicted peptides from different base models, one could select: (1) the peptide with the highest score from a model output, (2) the most frequently predicted peptide, or (3) the peptide closest to the precursor mass, and compare the performance of these methods against RankNovo. This approach would help demonstrate that RankNovo indeed learns some knowledge from the predicted results of multiple models."
