    "title": "Graphical-TS: An Interactive AI Pipeline for Multivariate Time Series with Ground-truth Graphical Modeling",
    "abstract": "We present \\texttt{Graphical-TS}, an interactive simulation framework for multivariate time series (MTS) incorporating spatiotemporal causal graphical models. The system offers extensive customizability, enabling users to define and modify causal dynamics with uncertainty in spatiotemporal relationships and functional mappings. \\texttt{Graphical-TS} integrates expert knowledge, supports MTS simulation, and allows for the input of real-world MTS data, facilitating a dynamic interplay between data-driven learning and domain expertise. The system iteratively enhances causal relationships and simulated data by simulating MTS data based on specified causal graphs, performing causal discovery from real or simulated MTS, and enabling the integration and refinement of expert knowledge with learned causality. This approach progressively improves the quality of causal models and the data they generate, supporting tasks such as time series forecasting, imputation, prediction, and robustness testing via scenario-driven distribution shifts. We compared state-of-the-art causal discovery methods on datasets generated by \\texttt{Graphical-TS}. The empirical results demonstrate the platform\u2019s consistent performance compared to existing methods while offering versatility under distinct scenarios. This enables users to explore datasets more thoroughly and drive improvements in causal discovery research. With an intuitive user interface that connects domain experts and algorithm developers, \\texttt{Graphical-TS} empowers users to manipulate causal relationships, embedding domain knowledge into machine learning workflows. Originally developed to study physiological dynamics in patients, the system has broad applicability across various fields, offering a versatile platform for generating MTS datasets with known dynamics, validating causal discovery algorithms, and advancing research in time series analysis.",

Below are specific weaknesses along with constructive and actionable insights for improvement:\n\n1. Empirical Validation and Case Studies\nWeakness: The paper lacks comprehensive empirical validation of the Graphical-TS framework. While it outlines the functionalities and theoretical underpinnings, there are limited real-world case studies or experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in practice.\n\nActionable Insight:\n\nIncorporate Case Studies: The authors should include detailed case studies that showcase the application of Graphical-TS in real-world scenarios, particularly in fields like healthcare or finance. This could involve analyzing existing datasets to illustrate how the framework improves causal discovery compared to traditional methods.\n\nBenchmarking Against Existing Methods: Conduct systematic comparisons with established causal discovery methods (e.g., PCMCI, GES) using standardized datasets. Presenting quantitative metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) would provide a clearer picture of the framework's performance and its advantages.\n\n2.
