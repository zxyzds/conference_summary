    "title": "Towards Human-like Virtual Beings: Simulating Human Behavior in 3D Scenes",
    "abstract": "Building autonomous agents that can replicate human behavior in the realistic 3D world is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. This requires agents to be holistic goal achievers and to naturally adapt to environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce ACTOR, an agent capable of performing high-level, long-horizon, abstract goals in 3D households, guided by its internal value similar to those of humans. ACTOR operates in a perceive-plan-act cycle, extending the ungrounded, scene-agnostic LLM controller with deliberate goal decomposition and decision-making through actively searching the behavior space, generating activity choices based on a hierarchical prior, and evaluating these choices using customizable value functions to determine the subsequent steps. Furthermore, we introduce BehaviorHub, a large-scale human behavior simulation dataset in scene-aware, complicated tasks. Considering the unaffordable acquisition of human-authored 3D human behavior data, we construct BehaviorHub by exploring the commonsense knowledge of LLMs learned from large corpora, and automatically aligning motion resources with 3D scene for knowledgeable generation. Extensive experiments on our established benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture leads to effective behavior planning and simulation. BehaviorHub also proves beneficial for downstream task development. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.",

                "value": "This paper presents ACTOR, an LLM system for simulating human-like behavior in 3D environments. It also proposes a comprehensive dataset, BehaviorHub, for training and evaluating such systems. ACTOR operates on a perceive-plan-act cycle, using value-based behavioral planning and hierarchical prior knowledge to decompose complex goals into achievable steps while adapting to environmental changes. The BehaviorHub dataset contains 10k human behavior samples in 1.5k 3D scenes, generated by a semi-automated pipeline that uses language models to generate plausible behavior sequences with corresponding motion data. The paper also presents an evaluation framework that measures both behavior planning and motion simulation effectiveness, and demonstrates ACTOR's superior performance compared to existing approaches."

                "value": "There are a few notable issues that concern me.\n\n1. Although the generation of human-like behavior from high-level description is promising, the proposed method does not show sufficient technical contributions to shed light on this problem. The use of LLM for manipulating agents or robots is not new (see [a, b]). Adopting the perception-decision-action loop is straightforward and not new either (see [c, d]). I do not see a clear statement that articulates the core contribution in techniques compared to previous methods.\n\n2. The value functions used seem relatively simplistic, using basic metrics such as shortest path and binary language-based decisions, rather than incorporating more sophisticated physical constraints or human behavior patterns. The probabilistic formulation of the value function used in this paper is somewhat trivial, as it is simply implemented by constructed decrete values, i.e., 1.0/0.7/0.3/0.01. Such a probabilistic model (p_v) does not involve any learning process, how to guarantee the that the used distribution match the actual underlying distribution?\n\n3. In addition, the baselines (LLMaP and HuggingGPT) aren't specifically designed for 3D human behavior simulation, and the human evaluation sample size is small with only five participants. It would be better if some more task-oriented baselines were used in the experiments.\n\n[a] J. Liang, W. Huang, F. Xia, P. Xu, K. Hausman, B. Ichter, P. Florence, and A.

This is difficult to evaluate when the 'ground-truth plans' mentioned in the paper are not explained e.g., in the example below \n*For behavior planning, Sentence-BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) are used to measure the semantic similarity between the ground-truth plans and predictions.* (5.4)\n\n2) Introducing hierarchical decomposition of goals and decision making. Why should candidates at the same level be restricted to executable actions or high-level semantic units of activities? I could see multiple potential paths where it might be beneficial for some paths to be longer than others. \n\n3) Perception module: Why does the below prompt *ENVIRONMENT: {residential interior}; OBJECTS: {bed, desk, chair, kitchen counter, sink, television,..., sofa}; SURROUNDINGS: {sink: empty, faucet: turned on, toilet: vacant}* help attain \u2018deep understanding of the environment\u2019.\nAre there any experiments/ previous works to justify this structure of inputs?"
