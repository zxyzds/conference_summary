    "title": "CAD-Editor: Text-based CAD Editing through Adapting Large Language Models with Synthetic Data",
    "abstract": "Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. \n\\emph{Text-based CAD editing}, which automatically modifies CAD models following textual instructions, is important yet not extensively studied. \nExisting work explores design variation generation, which randomly alters specific parts of a CAD model, offering no control over the final appearance.\nThis work introduces \\emph{CAD-Editor} for text-based editing.\nWe leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone to take the concatenation of textual instruction and original CAD sequence as input and predict the edited CAD sequence, where the sequence representation of a CAD model is designed for easier processing by LLMs.\nMoreover, we propose fine-tuning LLMs by using a synthetic dataset followed by a selective dataset.\nThe synthetic data is produced by leveraging powerful existing models, including design variation generation models for producing paired CAD models and multi-modal models for capturing textual differences between these pairs.\nThe selective data is created by choosing top examples from outputs of the initially fine-tuned LLMs based on human feedback or metrics.\nIn this way, a large-scale synthetic dataset offers basic capability while a selective dataset that is less noisy and better aligned with human intentions boosts performance further.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the advantage of CAD-Editor both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

                "value": "The paper introduces CAD-Editor, a novel approach for text-based CAD editing that leverages LLMs to interpret and apply textual instructions to CAD models. CAD-Editor is designed as a sequence-to-sequence generation model, enabling users to edit CAD models via natural language inputs. The paper outlines a method involving two phases of fine-tuning on synthetic and selective datasets to optimize performance. Experimental results demonstrate CAD-Editor\u2019s improvements in accuracy, alignment with textual instructions, and CAD model validity over other models, including SkexGen and Hnc-CAD. This work also establishes a benchmark for text-based CAD editing."

On one hand, the choice of the base dataset is crucial for the model's generalization ability, and CAD-Editor is only optimized on the DeepCAD dataset. On the other hand, the generation of the synthetic dataset relies on existing CAD generation models (such as SkexGen and Hnc-CAD), both of which are also trained on DeepCAD. Therefore, the performance of CAD-Editor on the DeepCAD benchmark raises suspicions of overfitting. That is, if the fine-tuning dataset mainly contains CAD models from a specific industry (such as the automotive industry), the trained model may not handle CAD models from other industries (such as aerospace or construction) well.\n- The reliance on GPT-4o. The proposed method requires multiple prompts to GPT-4o to obtain generated data. The article does not discuss the token cost of GPT-4o and potential performance bottlenecks."

I am curious whether CAD-Editor can be more effective when scaled to larger models or more diverse datasets.\n- How does CAD-Editor perform when dealing with vague or ambiguous text instructions? Does the model have the ability to identify and correct erroneous editing instructions?"
