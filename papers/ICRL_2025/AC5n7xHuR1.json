    "title": "AgentHarm: Benchmarking Robustness of LLM Agents on Harmful Tasks",
    "abstract": "The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents---which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks---may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly complaint with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak strings can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents.",

The benchmark is intended to be used to test whether guardrails put in place in LLM agents against harmful activities are indeed effective.\n\nThe paper includes an experimental evaluation, where several state of the art LLMs are tested against this benchmark."

                "value": "W1. The tasks are single prompt and require the LLM agent access to a set of tools pre-defined by the benchmark. While these tools may be realistic, this benchmark does not cover interactions in a more open-ended world. Harmful behaviours may emerge in unpredictable scenarios that go beyond pre-defined toolsets, which limits the real-world robustness of the benchmark. I think this is an inherent weakness with any testing benchmark of such kind, although it could be mitigated by having the ability to increment the set of tools available or having the possibility for the agent to have multi-step conversations, i.e., sequentially generating prompts from the agent's responses. This is also limited by the nature of the task, as giving harmful agents access to the open world would be a bad idea.\n\nW2. As part of its grading function, the benchmark uses other LLMs to judge whether the responses are malicious or not. I see two problems with this choice. The first one is that it is not clear to me when reading the paper whether the reliability of these judges was tested, and if so, how reliable their answers are. The second one is that this could become a vulnerability of the benchmark. A malicious entity could attack the LLM judge to produce assessments of \"no harm\" in order to certify a malicious LLM agent as \"not harmful\". I am not suggesting changing the benchmark to address this vulnerability, I rather think this is an issue that a potential certification authority using this benchmark would have to address. I suggest the authors mention this risk as part of the discussion in Sec. 5.\n\nW3. Since this is a benchmark paper, it would be useful in the assessment to have access to the full benchmark. As far as I can see, there is no source code included as supplementary material."

LLM judges are only used for narrowly defined sub-assessments not for scoring overall success. Success on a task requires\n\n- all expected tools have been called and have been called in right order\n    \n- key details (e.g. specific PII) has been mentioned\n    \n- LLM judges may be used to verify expected semantics of specific text artefacts (e.g. whether an email represents a valid attempt to buy a forged passport)\n    \n- refusals are assessed using an LLM judge \u00a0\n    \n\nIn addition to the malicious tasks, the authors include a dataset of 110 benign agentic tasks that otherwise exactly mirror the malicious agentic tasks. This allows them to assess the difference in success rate between jailbroken behavior on malicious tasks vs non-jailbroken behavior on benign tasks and thereby assess performance degradation from jailbreak prompts. \u00a0\n\nThe main findings are\n\n- very simple jailbreak attacks reduce refusal rates very significantly (tens of percentage points) for many SotA LLMs. Implies that SotA LLMs are not robust against jailbreaks to enforce malicious agentic behavior\n    \n- many models exhibit high success rates and low refusal rates even without jailbreaks\n    \n- Task completion success rates under jailbroken conditions are very high and comparable to success rates on benign tasks. Implies that the jailbreak does not impede competent behavior of the LLMs\n    \n- best-of-n-sampling can very significantly increase success rates\n    \n- performance and refusal rate vary a lot across different harm domains\n    \n- refusal rates are also affected by different prompting techniques (CoT, ReAct)"
