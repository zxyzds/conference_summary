    "title": "Multi-objective antibody design with constrained preference optimization",
    "abstract": "Antibody design is crucial for developing therapies against diseases such as cancer and viral infections. Recent deep generative models have significantly advanced computational antibody design, particularly in enhancing binding affinity to target antigens. However, beyond binding affinity, antibodies should exhibit other favorable biophysical properties such as non-antigen binding specificity and low self-association, which are important for antibody developability and clinical safety. To address this challenge, we propose AbNovo, a framework that leverages constrained preference optimization for multi-objective antibody design. First, we pre-train an antigen-conditioned generative model for antibody structure and sequence co-design. Then, we fine-tune the model using binding affinity as a reward while enforcing explicit constraints on other biophysical properties. Specifically, we model the physical binding energy with continuous rewards rather than pairwise preferences and explore a primal-and-dual approach for constrained optimization. Additionally, we incorporate a structure-aware protein language model to mitigate the issue of limited training data. Evaluated on independent test sets, AbNovo outperforms existing methods in metrics of binding affinity such as Rosetta binding energy and evolutionary plausibility, as well as in metrics for other biophysical properties like stability and specificity.",

                "value": "This paper focuses on some important properties, such as non-antigen binding specificity and low self-association, and optimizes the model in a DPO-like manner. What differs it from other DPO-based methods lies in two forms, the optimization targets and continuous rewards. With a two stages training framework, the proposed AbNovo is capable of capturing generalized protein information and constraining the generated results with desired properties. Experiments also support the effectiveness that generated antibodies are well designed."

                "value": "1. The announcement of \"The first deep generative model for multi-objective antibody design\" in summarized contributions, AbDPO also supports multi-objective optimization.\n\n2. In energy evaluation, if you want to assess the energy performance of the designed backbone, energy minimization is necessary for the side chains while keeping the backbone structure unchanged, and then calculate the energy. If you wish to evaluate the antibody's performance in real experiments (which implies the CDR region's structure might not maintain the designed configuration), you can use multi-chain supporting folding models like AlphaFold3 to predict the binding structure. When calculating energy, does the relaxation you used optimize only the side chain conformations, or does it also alter the main chain structure? If it's the latter, are these experiments intended to demonstrate that AbNovo can generate a better initial structure for Rosetta relaxation?\n\n3. Does the optimization of these physical properties contribute to some chemical validity? For example, does the peptide bond length get closer to the actual length?\n\n4. The standard deviation of the physical energy needs to be presented.\n\n5. The AAR performance is excessively high, and it's necessary to check whether the training data of the protein language model contains samples similar to the test set.\n\n6. I am curious about how many amino acids have mutated in those designed antibodies that outperform natural ones (at least in binding energy).\n\n7. The task setting of dyMEAN is different from others, including AbNovo. dyMEAN does not provide the real FR structure, making direct comparison somewhat unfair. Additionally, how is it achieved to use dyMEAN to generate 128 antibodies for an antigen?\n\n8. Calculating RMSD on the aligned structures seems somewhat unreasonable. Typically, for two rigid bodies that can freely undergo SE(3) transformations, alignment is performed first, followed by RMSD calculation. However, in the setting of this paper, the FR region is given, meaning the CDR region cannot undergo SE(3) transformations independently, thus requiring a direct RMSD calculation."

In there, we also observe that only a single antibody generated by DiffAb against 5NUZ does violate constraints. Therefore, it seems inadequate that the visualized antibody for DiffAb in Figure 2 is a sample which does not fulfill all constraints.
