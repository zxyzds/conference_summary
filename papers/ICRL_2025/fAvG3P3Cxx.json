    "title": "MultiRC: Joint Learning for Time Series Anomaly Prediction and Detection with Multi-scale Reconstructive Contrast",
    "abstract": "Many methods have been proposed for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. Despite some progress, research on predicting future anomalies is still relatively scarce. Predicting anomalies is particularly challenging due to the diverse reaction time and the lack of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRC to integrate reconstructive and contrastive learning for joint learning of anomaly prediction and detection, with multi-scale structure and adaptive dominant period mask to deal with the diverse reaction time. MultiRC also generates negative samples to provide essential training momentum for the anomaly prediction tasks and prevent model degradation. We evaluate seven benchmark datasets from different fields. For both anomaly prediction and detection tasks, MultiRC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/status/MultiRC-CCE6.",

This lack of specificity could hinder readers from understanding how the framework directly addresses the anomaly prediction problem.\n\n2. Inaccurate Representation of Prior Work: The description of the Anomaly Transformer seems to overlook its handling of \"prior-association\" and \"series-association,\" which are crucial aspects of its approach. This misrepresentation could lead to an incomplete comparison with the existing literature. The paper mentions the DCdetector's architecture but does not elaborate on its multi-scale sampling structure and approach. This omission might affect the comprehensiveness of the discussion on related work.\n\n3. Potential Error in Problem Definition: In the anomaly prediction task, the definition of the antecedent range as t-r: r seems to have an error. The starting index of the future look-forward window should be t instead of t+1, as t represents a time point, not a duration.\n\n5. Vagueness in Multi-scale Structure Explanation: The paper states that variables with longer periodic changes are more likely to evolve gradually, but it does not provide clear evidence or examples to support this claim. This lack of clarity could confuse readers and detract from the paper's credibility.\n\n6. Insufficient Detail on Univariate Sub-sequences: The process of obtaining univariate sub-sequences and the rationale behind using similarity calculations for extracting dominant periodic components require further explanation. The current exposition is ambiguous and may impede reader comprehension.\n\n7. Suspicious Performance Data: The PAD method's reported F1 score on the SWaT dataset is lower than both its Precision and Recall values, which is counterintuitive. This discrepancy raises doubts about the accuracy of the experimental data presented in the paper."

Therefore, when the anomaly labels are accurate (indicating the beginning of anomalies regardless of severity), the anomaly prediction task assumed in this paper should essentially belong to the standard anomaly detection task. In other words, the anomaly labels in Figure 1 are inaccurate. It should include the yellow area. \nTherefore, I do not think the anomaly prediction problem differs from anomaly detection tasks.\n\nI know that several multivariate anomaly detection datasets used in this paper have inaccurate anomaly labels. The widely used UCR anomaly dataset contains many time series with accurately labeled anomalies. I suggest that the authors use this dataset for further research. Moreover, the paper lacks specific examples of dataset analysis. It would be better to provide more visualized results to support the research.\n\nThe paper's methodology is limited in terms of innovation. There have been research works on contrastive representation learning for anomaly detection. The investigation into related works is insufficient. Also, the motivation for using representations from different resolutions as positive samples is unclear. \n\nFrom the source code, window sizes seem to be too short (64), much less than the actual abnormal window size (>1000). \n\nThe writing quality of this version of the paper is unsatisfactory due to many unexplained details. In particular, mathematical formulas and algorithm descriptions lack explanation or contain errors, resulting in some details of the model being unclear.\n\nFor examples: \n- The subscript range in x_{t-h-1:t-h-1} at line 216 is incorrect.\n- It's unclear how patch x_p at line 244 maps multiple scales to different timesteps due to varying patch numbers at different granularities.\n-  Formulas 6 lack formal definitions for c and i, with no relevant explanations in the context or formulas.\n- It's unclear how x_{n,p} at line 293 is generated, and the definitions of n and p are ambiguous.\n- The settings for lambda_{Con} and lambda_{Rec} in (11) are not clearly explained.\n- The variables h and f at line 417 are not utilized in the model section, raising confusion. The specific differences between the anomaly prediction process during training/testing and anomaly detection tasks lack explanation.\n\nSince the instance normalization technique is utilized in the proposed framework when some abnormal ts are segmented and shifted from the original range, will this normalization operation produce false negative results?\n\nComputational costs: As you use channel independence, what are the computational costs? Will dealing with multivariate time series be much slower?"
