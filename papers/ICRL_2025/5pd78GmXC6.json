    "title": "Charting the Design Space of Neural Graph Representations for Subgraph Matching",
    "abstract": "Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering, molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc.\nNeural methods have shown promising results for subgraph matching.\nOur study of recent systems suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching networks.\nExisting methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space, which remains largely uncharted.\nWe undertake the first comprehensive exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural representations of the graphs.\nOur extensive experiments reveal that judicious and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large performance benefits.\nBeyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.",

The authors observe that prior methods for neural graph matching have been narrowly focused, with most methods falling into limited design categories. To address this, the authors organize a comprehensive framework including key architectural choices: relevance distance, interaction stages, interactions structures, interaction non-linearity, and interaction granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that unexplored combinations within this design space can lead to performance improvement."

                "value": "-  While the paper does a thorough job of exploring the design space or structured ablation studies, it does not provide a principled explanation of why certain configurations (or subcomponents) yield performance improvements. Adding a more in-depth empirical and theoretical analysis can address this issue. This can not only strengthen the contributions but also offer a more principled foundation for future research in this area.\n- Although the best combination shows performance benefits, its novelty is limited. The only differences between the best model and the existing state-of-the-art (IsoNet) are the interaction stage and non-linearity (which have been proposed in existing studies). Without providing principled rationales (as the first bullet), this could make the contributions appear incremental.\n- The dense presentation makes it challenging for readers to immediately see the paper\u2019s structure and key subcomponents. I think the authors should present a clearer organization and structured outline. In particular, Figure 1 is hard to interpret. I think that the authors can provide more human-readable visualization. Plus, please put some margin to the bottom of Figure 1."

Some of the paper writing can be made more clearer. E.g. \u201cChallenging the widely\nheld expectation that early interaction is more powerful, IsoNet\u2019s late interaction approach outperforms GMN, even when GMN\u2019s final score computation is made asymmetric\u201d \u2013 It is a bit unclear what it means by \u201casymmetric\u201d, especially due to the fact this is written at the beginning of intro and the audience may not be familiar with this area of research. \n3. It may be useful to introduce/outline the summarized findings at the end of the introduction section."
