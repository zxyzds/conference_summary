    "title": "Iterative Nash Policy Optimization: Aligning LLMs with General Preferences via No-Regret Learning",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success\nin aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent\nRLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In\nthis paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach\nit from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as\na two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy\noptimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-\nregret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods,\nINPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead,\nwe introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference\ndataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its\neffectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an\nLLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win\nrate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial\nimprovement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms.",

                "value": "This paper studies the RLHF problem from two-player game perspective, namely the Nash learning problem with human preference, which is a generalization of the contemporary Bradley-Terry model. Unlike previous papers which learns and approximates the underlying preference model, this paper assumes only the access to query human feedback from the preference oracle. The proposed algorithm, INPO, follows a self-play training framework where each player performs a mirror descend to optimize its objective function, which consists of the win probability and a KL regularizer, preventing the current policy to deviate from reference policy. Through a carefully designed loss, the algorithm does not need to estimate the win probability of two responses. Theoretical convergence rate and intensive experiments with LLMs are provided."

This paper studies the Nash policy learning from the human feedback problem with only access to the query oracle, without a function approximator for the underlying preference dynamic. This setting is novel and more challenging than previous papers on similar settings. In the reviewer's view, this problem formulation also has much potential in training LLMs under diverse human populations (instead of obtaining feedback from GPT-4), where the underlying preference dynamic may be impossible to approximate. \n\n2. The proposed algorithm INPO uses a carefully designed loss, which does not estimate the win rate of two trajectories, and has the potential to improve human query complexity. It is practical and implementable.\n\n3. Extensive experimentation on LLMs and representative benchmarks has been conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach. INPO is shown in Table. 1 to outperform baselines of the same size in the average sense. The theoretical convergence rate is also provided, including duality gap convergence and policy convergence."

                "value": "1. The confidence intervals in experimental results are not provided, and the significance of improvement for the proposed algorithm is not evaluated.\n\n2. One of the claims the paper made is the algorithm does not need to estimate the average win rate of two responses, unlike previous works, say [1][2], and is potentially more query efficient. This claim is not entirely solid, as previous works, say [2], seem also implementable without estimating the average win rate accurately, i.e., set K=1 in Algorithm 1 of [2]. Even though the experiment results favor the claim compared to SPPO in Table. 1, where SPPO used more queries, more justification on where the query efficient advantage comes from needs to be detailed, i.e. is it from variance reduction, or from better-extracting information from preference?\n\n2. The theoretical contribution is limited. The main theorems, i.e., Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, are based on infinite human queries at each iteration, and the assumption that the optimization problem (7) at each iteration can be exactly solved.\nThis makes the theoretical model almost the same as classic online mirror descent under convex objective function, and the proofs also directly plug in the classic OMD results. Assumption A is also unrealistic, as it requires the support of reference policy to cover all policies in the optimization trajectory, including the optimal policy. Due to these idealized assumptions, and the fact that the training only lasts for T=3 iterations in the experiment, the main theorems could not provide any insight on the empirical improvement of INPO. However, if the authors position this paper's contribution majorly on the empirical side, the level of theoretical limitation may still be acceptable.\n\n[1] Rosset, Corby, et al. \"Direct nash optimization: Teaching language models to self-improve with general preferences.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.03715 (2024).\n\n[2] Wu, Yue, et al. \"Self-play preference optimization for language model alignment.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.00675 (2024)."

                "value": "RLHF involves optimizing a policy to align a language model with human preferences. It is generally done by separately training a reward model and then uses RL steps with this reward model as feedback as well as a regularization to ensure that the model does not drift too far from the initially trained LM.\n\nThe paper proposes an algorithm to bypass the training of a separate reward model (this line of work has been introduced by the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, Rafailov et al., 2024). It does so by iteratively optimizing the policy in an online learning fashion. Similarly to Nash Learning from Human Feedback, Munos et al. (2023), it formulates the problem as a two-players game where the Nash equilibrium is the symmetric optimal policy for both players. The duality gap represents how close from the optimum $\\pi*$ the policies are.\n\nThen, the paper introduces the iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO) algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Basically, INPO is an online mirror descent tailored for this specific problem. Theorems 3 and 4 prove convergence (Theorem 3 gives a bound on the duality gap for the averaged policy over $T$ rounds that scales in $O(1/ \\sqrt{T})$). Several experiments support the paper."

At least, a deeper comparison would be needed. Except slight variations, is it possible to have a clearer description of the true contributions of the paper?\n\nIt is mentioned that INPO is better than its offline counterparts, a claim that is quite common in the RLHF literature. However, is there a guarantee to bound the convergence rates or the precision of an online versus an offline procedure here?
