    "title": "UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules",
    "abstract": "Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.",

            "summary": {
                "value": "This paper proposes a unified model for molecular generation and property predictions. Since diffusion models require diffusing the 3D molecular conformers to a collapsed state, the molecular structures in the early time steps do not contain any meaningful structural information. As a result, the joint training of generation and property prediction can be inconsistent in the early stage. The author develops a theoretical framework to explain this issue. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel training paradigm that separates the diffusion time steps into two stages, which are nucleation time and growth time. The joint training would only be conducted during the growth time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                "value": "(1) It appears that the nucleation time cannot be determined prior to training the diffusion models. This could prove to be highly costly if there is a need to repeatedly retrain the diffusion models with varying hyperparameters, which may be impractical in real-world applications;\n\n(2) While the theoretical framework is well-developed, this reviewer believes that the theoretical analysis section occupies an excessive portion of the paper. Given that the phenomenon observed by the authors is quite intuitive, experimental observations or straightforward explanations could suffice;\n\n(3) Although the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, UniGem only marginally outperforms the baseline methods across most datasets and tasks. Furthermore, the molecular generation benchmark is not entirely convincing at this stage, as the evaluation metrics used in this benchmark fail to distinguish the capabilities of various state-of-the-art generation models. Also, in the molecular quantum property prediction benchmark tasks, UniGem only slightly surpasses the baseline models, and many quantum properties are absent from the reported benchmark results. Overall, the current empirical results do not sufficiently convince readers of the superiority of the proposed method;\n\n(4) The novelty is a little bit limited from the algorithmic contribution side. The major contribution is splitting the diffusion training into two different stages and only conducting the joint training in the later stage. This is somehow not that significant in more general application domains."

Denoising has recently emerged as a dominant pre-training method for molecular representation learning, with strong physical interpretability. Combining the diffusion model with representation learning is a promising direction and good first trial.\n\n2. Decoupling atom type and coordinates during generation is an interesting approach. Together with theoretical insights, this approach shows promise in reducing generation error. This technique resembles some protein generation models, where pure chain geometry is initially learned before predicting amino acid sequences.\n\n3.

                "value": "1. The experimental setup lacks depth. To better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, I suggest testing on a property-conditioned generation task using the QM9 dataset, a standard benchmark for generative models. This would offer a more challenging evaluation, testing both the model\u2019s ability to learn representations related to specific conditions and its capacity to capture the underlying data distribution\u2014goals that align very well with the proposed method\u2019s objectives.\n\n2. The comparisons lack recent SOTA methods. It would be valuable to compare UniGEM\u2019s performance in prediction tasks against other pre-trained methods that also leverage denoising, such as UniMol or Frad (I understand that the model backbones differ, yet this comparison could at least shed some lights). This will test whether UniGEM\u2019s approach (i.e., diffusion-based denoising, with larger noise levels and more fine-grained steps) offers advantages over conventional coarser denoising techniques in representation learning."
