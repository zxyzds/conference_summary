    "abstract": "Continual learning has made significant progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting in vision and language domains, yet the majority of research has treated these modalities separately. The exploration of multimodal continual learning remains sparse, with a few existing works focused on specific applications like VQA, text-to-vision retrieval, and incremental multi-tasking. These efforts lack a general benchmark to standardize the evaluation of models in multimodal continual learning settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL), designed specifically for multimodal classification tasks. Our benchmark comprises a curated selection of multimodal datasets tailored to classification challenges. We further adapt a widely used Vision-Language model to multiple existing continual learning strategies, providing crucial insights into the behavior of vision-language models in incremental classification tasks. This work represents the first comprehensive framework for MCIL, establishing a foundation for future research in multimodal continual learning.",

                "value": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We addressed the point as follows.\n(1) We kinda disagree with the view that MCIL is not necessary just because vision-language models are powerful. As shown in the MCIL benchmark and model comparison, the challenge exists since performance drops substantially during experiences. Regardless of the intrinsic power of current vision-language models, you can't have a clue of an existing conceptual/theoretical/practical problem until you don't test the models against new challenges. Furthermore, multimodal vision-language classification is an industry-relevant problem, although is not popular in academic scenarios, it's one of the most requested use cases in some industry niche scenarios, and currently, there is not a single insight in the literature regarding how to handle pure multimodal classification problems in continual learning. We also think the argument that both modalities are not needed simultaneously to perform well should be formally demonstrated, not just stated. And maybe here we should have demonstrated this point. This is something we can do, and we thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. Regarding the issue of removing samples containing the ground truth class label in the text part, we ended up removing just a few examples per dataset, in the order of 1-10 samples, so a negligible portion of the data. No concern for leakage.\n(2) We agree that the presentation is not rich enough, and incomplete. We can improve a lot here."

                "value": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We addressed the points as follows: \n(1) we agree that the benchmark is limited. However, we made an effort to select the best pure vision-language candidates for multimodal classification. Finding relevant pure multimodal datasets is not easy since they are quite unpopular, and we did our best to at least provide the basis for a new challenge.\n(2) This issue has been raised by a previous reviewer, so I'll re-post the answer here. We think there is a misunderstanding. The cited papers are irrelevant to the current proposal. The mentioned papers are meant for unimodal scenarios. The classification problem is treated in a multimodal fashion, but as very standard for CLIP-based few-shot classification, the true modality is the vision one. The language modality is just a textual rearrangement of the classification label. So you use unimodal datasets. This is not the context in which we are proposing our benchmark. We are proposing a multimodal classification benchmark. That means that the dataset already contains image and text data aligned, both carrying their pack of semantic knowledge (this is different from engineering the class label of an unimodal dataset into a sentence of the form \"a photo of a [class]\"). \n(3) we agree that the methods proposed for model comparison are not comprehensive. We can extend the baseline model comparison with new methods and work on further Flava adaptation. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the new method to include.\n(4) The purpose of this paper was to propose a new benchmark, to to obtain a new sota. We selected a representative model designed for pure multimodal problems. We think this provides a conceptually relevant baseline to understand the challenge of multimodal CIL, more relevant than picking the newest models for the newest sota since new models and sota are produced every week.\n(5) We agree that the paper lacks a deep explanation and justification in most sections. We believe the paper can improve a lot from this perspective."

We addressed the points as follows:\n(1) We think there is a big misunderstanding since the cited papers are irrelevant to the current proposal. Except for the Audio-Visual CIL work, the mentioned papers are meant for unimodal scenarios. The classification problem is treated in a multimodal fashion, but as very standard for CLIP-based few-shot classification (in continual learning), the true modality is the vision one. The language modality is just a textual rearrangement of the classification label. So you use unimodal datasets. This is not the context we are proposing our benchmark in. We are proposing a multimodal classification benchmark. That means that the dataset already contains image and text data aligned, both carrying their pack of semantic knowledge (this is different from engineering the class label of a unimodal dataset into a sentence of the form \"a photo of a [class]\". We agree that the audio-related literature should be included in the references. A pure Vision-Language classification benchmark still doesn't exist in the literature.\n(2) ImageNet1K is a vision dataset. How does it relate to our multimodal vision-language scenario? We can maybe better clarify in the main manuscript why there is a crucial difference between unimodal and vision-language datasets and why we selected pure vision-language datasets instead of vision-only ones. However, CUB, Flowers, and DVM cars, as stated in the manuscript, are a set of curated datasets ready for multimodal classification. We discarded several irrelevant datasets, but we are open to advice regarding how to extend the benchmark.\n(3) CLIP and ALIGN accomplish classification tasks in unimodal scenarios, not in multimodal ones. In multimodal scenarios, both information (vision and language) carry information for the final classification. CLIP-related methods are unbalanced since the true data is the image, and the text data is ad-hoc engineered text reflecting the class label. To turn CLIP into a pure multimodal classifier you have to pick the final vision embedding and the final text embedding and engineer them to map onto classification nodes. The need to have this additional step made us prefer Flava-like models, intrinsically designed to have an end-to-end multimodal classification mechanism. I hope this difference is clear. We can clarify this in the manuscript.\n(4) We agree that more methods should be included, and as suggested by the reviewer, most methods like regularization-based ones are compatible with Flava. So we can include more methods in the model comparison.\n\n\nQuestions.\n(1) The text input is the sentence associated with an image in the original multimodal datasets. \n(2) MCIL is for multimodal classification, CLIP-based CIL is for unimodal classification.\n(3) Those 3 datasets are the only ones that survived a long selection process. Industry-relevant, pure vision-language datasets, are unpopular, and most of them are too trivial."

                "value": "1. My major concern is that the contribution is limited. This benchmark is referred to as multimodal, but it only includes visual and language modalities, and is limited to image classification tasks. However, such a so-called multimodal class-incremental learning (MCIL) classification task has already been investigated. There are some works on class-incremental learning using visual-language models[1-5] and it seems that there is no difference between their setting and the proposed MCIL setting. The authors should clarify and carefully discuss the differences between them. Besides, apart from the visual and language modalities, there are also works investigating the audio-visual incremental learning problem [6], and I suggest the authors should conduct a comprehensive literature review before proposing a new benchmark. The authors should explicitly compare their proposed benchmark to the existing works, highlighting any key differences or improvements. Additionally, the authors should expand their literature review to include audio-visual and other multimodal incremental learning approaches, and discuss how their benchmark relates to or differs from these broader multimodal settings.\n2. The datasets CUB, Oxford Flowers, and DVM-CAR are all small-scale datasets. Some core settings are missing from the experiments, such as experiments on ImageNet1K and experiments with different numbers of tasks, which are widely adopted in different class-incremental learning works. I suggest the authors to justify their choice of datasets and explain why they believe these are sufficient for evaluating multimodal class-incremental learning.\n3. I cannot understand why methods similar to CLIP and ALIGN do not meet Eq1. Although these methods cannot generate a unified multimodal feature representation, they still accomplish classification tasks by calculating cosine similarities. At the same time, I also fail to understand how Flava is used. What is the text input of Flava in the MCIL setting?\n4. The survey of related work is not comprehensive enough, and the compared baseline methods are not comprehensive. The recent works only include L2P and DualPrompt, which is insufficient for a benchmark evaluation. Since the authors choose Flava, which generates a unified feature representation, classic CIL methods such as Regularization-based methods (e.g. LwF) and replay-based methods (e.g. iCaRL) can also be used in the Flava model. I suggest the authors could refer to [7] for a comprehensive review of CIL methods. The authors are advised to supplement relevant experiments.\n5. Some minor issues:\n    - The number of images in line 144 and line 152, '.'->','\n    - The title of Figure 1 is too simple.\n    - In Table 1, it would be easier to understand if UB and LB are listed separately, and the best results among other methods are bolded. The formatting of Table 1 could also be improved.\n    - I suggest the authors add a figure to illustrate the whole pipeline of the proposed MCIL setting.\n\n[1] Select and Distill: Selective Dual-Teacher Knowledge Transfer for Continual Learning on Vision-Language Models (ECCV24)\n\n[2] Boosting Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models via Mixture-of-Experts Adapters (CVPR2024)\n\n[3] Continual Vision-Language Representation Learning with Off-Diagonal Information (ICML2023)\n\n[4] Preventing Zero-Shot Transfer Degradation in Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models (ICCV 2023)\n\n[5] Generative Negative Text Replay for Continual Vision-Language Pretraining (ECCV2022)\n\n[6] Audio-visual class-incremental learning.

The benchmark is formed using three existing benchmarks that consist of images along with their captions.  5 CL methods along with an upperbound and a lowerbound using Flava as the base model are tested on the benchmark by splitting each dataset into 10 incremental tasks."

What unique challenges does multimodal class-incremental learning present that are not captured by unimodal benchmarks? Other than changing the model from unimodal to multimodal, what is the specific challenge that makes this dataset specific?\n\n2. What is the novelty and motivation of this work? What specific gaps in existing multimodal continual learning research does this benchmark address?\n\n3. How this work can help researchers? How does this benchmark compare to or improve upon existing multimodal or continual learning datasets? How might researchers use this benchmark to develop new multimodal continual learning algorithms?"
