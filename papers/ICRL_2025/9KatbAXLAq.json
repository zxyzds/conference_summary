    "title": "Certified PEFTSmoothing: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Randomized Smoothing",
    "abstract": "Randomized smoothing is the primary certified robustness method for accessing the robustness of deep learning models to adversarial perturbations in the $l_2$-norm, by taking a majority vote over the multiple predictions of a random Gaussian perturbed input of the base classifier. To fulfill the certified bound and empirical accuracy of randomized smoothing, the base model either needs to be retrained from scratch to learn Gaussian noise or adds an auxiliary denoiser to eliminate it. In this work, we propose \\textit{PEFTSmoothing}, which teach the base model to learn the Gaussian noise-augmented data with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods in both white-box and black-box settings. This design is based on the intuition that large-scale models have the potential to learn diverse data patterns, including the noise data distributions. In addition, we explore the possibility of combining \\textit{PEFTSmoothing} with the fine-tuning for downstream task adaptation, which allows us to simultaneously obtain a robust version of the large vision model and its adaptation tailored to downstream datasets. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of \\textit{PEFTSmoothing}, which allow us to certify over 98\\% accuracy for ViT on CIFAR-10, 20\\% higher than SoTA denoised smoothing, and over 61\\% accuracy on ImageNet which is 30\\% higher than CNN-based denoiser and comparable to the Diffusion-based denoiser.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a PEFT-inspired method for adapting pre-trained base models to produce robust classification performance under noise-augmented data. The authors propose a white-box method that augments a trainable layer to a given base model (of various architectures) and tunes its parameters with respect to a Cross-Entropy Loss under noise-augmented labeled data samples. They also provide a black-box approach that uses an AutoEncoder style Coordinator with a frozen encoder and a trainable decoder to denoise/augment the noisy data samples before feeding them to the base model. The black-box coordinator is trained using SPSA with Cross Entropy Loss under noise-augmented labeled data. Finally, the authors also propose a joint fine-tuning and robustifying training that retrains a large model to adapt it to a downstream task while also adapting it to the randomized smoothing noise injection. \n\nThe authors also provide extensive experiments for CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets, comparing the proposed methods to other SOTA denoised smoothing methods."

Given that most of the results in the paper are based on LoRA, it might be useful to provide a detailed explanation of the setup and training of the LoRA model. Similarly, I would urge the authors to provide a more detailed overview of the four different PEFT approaches considered in the paper. Figure 1 does not adequately explain the PEFT setting. \n\nThe Imagenet results in the appendix are quite a lot worse compared to the Diffusion denoiser. While the authors suggest that this can be attributed mostly to the fact that the diffusion-based denoiser is more powerful for higher-resolution images, is there a smoother trade-off that can be established between the two models? A small discussion on this could be quite helpful."

Rather than retraining models from scratch, this work proposes using parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), typically used to fine-tune language models, to enable models to learn adversarially perturbed data-distributions.\n\nThe key contributions are as follows:\n- White-box PEFT smoothing, in which a vision model is fine-tuned after perturbing the dataset with gaussian noise.\n- Black-box PEFT tuning, in which zeroth-order optimization (specifically SPSA) is used to create a prompt-tuning based method for fine-tuning the model with perturbed data.\n- A thorough experimental validation shows that PEFT can be used to efficiently make ViT models more robust."

For instance\n  - The claim made on lines 144-146 \"Theoreticaly, Theorem 2.1 ... with Gaussian noised inputs\" is a strong one, and requires either a citation or some kind of rigorous or empirical justification in the paper.\n  - Lines 150-156 are also unclear. For instance, the authors should clarify \"large-scale vision model ... acquire such potential ...\". What does the phrase \"acquire such potential\" refer to?\n  - lines 346-347: \"this is mainly due ... especially for high resolution images\" is another strong claim that either requires a citation or empirical justification\n- It is unclear what the authors mean by \"certified.\" Is it that the PEFT can be used to guarantee the conditions of Theorem 2.1? If so, can the authors provide a formal proof for this? In order to make a claim that a method is 'Certified', a rigorous guarantee must be provided.\n- Equation (6) is written poorly and appears to be key to the entire experimental slate (and thus, this paper). Specifically:\n  - The expression should be written in terms of indicator functions\n  - The use of the '&' is unclear - do you mean the product?\n  - The authors state that \"certifiedCheck returns 1 if Theorem 2.1 is satisfied\". However, the conditions in Theorem 2.1 are all probabilistic in nature. How are the probabilities computed? Specifically, how is $\\mathrm{Pr}[F(x+\\varepsilon) = c_A]$ computed?"

Combining two well known methods, smoothing and PEFT, does not cross the novelty threshold. There is also a very large literature on certified robustness that the authors do not compare against, see https://sokcertifiedrobustness.github.io/\n\n2. Limited baselines. Compare against and cite the following relevant works:\n- S. Srinivas et al., Which Models have Perceptually-Aligned Gradients? An Explanation via Off-Manifold Robustness, NeurIPS 2023\n- R. Shao et al., On the Adversarial Robustness of Vision Transformers, TMLR 2022, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15670\n- T. Tsiligkaridis et al, Diverse Gaussian Noise Consistency Regularization for Robustness and Uncertainty Calibration, IJCNN 2023, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01231\n\nThe datasets are also quite limited and simple so I suggest a more thorough experimental study involving more domain-specific datasets, e.g. WILDS.\n\n3. How far is empirical robustness from certified robustness in your setting? A comparison is needed. Approaches for gradient masking mitigation have been studied. What are the tradeoffs? What about computational complexity?\n\n4. How does the geometry of the loss landscape depend upon the robustness properties of the large vision models you study? These are intimately related based the adversarial robustness literature."

This paper just utilizes the existing PEFT on a large-scale classification model and tests its performance under randomized smoothing. This raises concerns regarding the paper\u2019s technical contribution.\n\n**Significance**: The primary challenge in randomized smoothing (RS) is not training noise-robust classifiers but reducing the extensive inference time required for certification, often involving a majority vote over 10,000 samples. While the paper aims to reduce model training time through PEFT, this does not address the more critical issue of RS's substantial inference delay. This raises concerns about the practical impact of the proposed work.\n\n2. Some experimental settings are unfair:\n\nIn Figure 2, it's unfair to compare the PEFT methods with those training-free denoising methods.\n\nIn Table 1, clarification is needed regarding the base models used for RS and DS methods. Based on the reported performance, it appears these methods are evaluated using ResNet architectures, while PEFTsmoothing employs ViT-L and ViT-B models.\n\n3. An interesting result is that the LORA-based tuning method outperforms the full fine-tuning-based method. Typically, the performance of parameter-efficient methods could be close to but not surpass the full fine-tuning method. A more detailed analysis of this would be valuable."
