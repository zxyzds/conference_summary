    "title": "EconAI: Preference-driven Agents Simulating Economic Activities via Large Language Model",
    "abstract": "The emergence of artificial intelligence has transformed the methodological frameworks in economic research by simulating intricate interactions among diverse agents. Despite the advantage of large language models (LLMs), they often struggle with occasions involving decision-making interactions with environments. This challenge stems from the fact that most LLMs are rationality-driven, seeking optimal economic benefits, while humans are preference-driven, pursuing the balance of personal goals (\\textit{e.g.,} income and health). These differences hinder the LLMs' ability to effectively understand economic activities across various contexts, leading to biases in economic simulations. To tackle this issue, we introduce \\textbf{EconAI}, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the preference learning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating human-like preferences and cognitive processes. Specifically, EconAI features a 'knowledge brain' constructed from historical data and learning algorithms, enabling memory and making decisions for sophisticated economic facts.  By integrating elements of self-learning, reflection, and experience updates, we refine decision-making processes, resulting in more accurate economic planning and mitigating planning bias in economic activities. Through the integration of real-time economic data and historical trends, EconAI offers a robust simulation platform that can adapt to market fluctuations and economic shocks. Our findings demonstrate that EconAI can model economic phenomena like inflation and employment with greater precision, showcase a notable ability to adjust to changing economic conditions, and surpass existing frameworks significantly.",

However, it's unclear how these preferences are generated on an individual level (e.g. how certain agents are more risk averse than others). Or maybe the authors only interpreted \"preference\" to be rules/policies learnt from experiences. This needs to be clarified.\n\n3. The micro-level analysis is quite shallow and only includes some qualitative responses from the LLM. To show how the knowledge brain can improve the simulation quality on a micro-level, the paper should compare the results against other models such as EconAgent. Including more micro-level quantitative measures would be useful, for example, what knowledge/preferences do different agents have/learn.\n\n4. It would be great if the authors can include some example scenario prompts and model responses in the appendix.\n\n5. The paper fails to discuss the limitation of the EconAgent model."

                "value": "(1) In the abstract, \"most LLMs are rationality-driven, seeking optimal economic benefits ...\" Could you explain the logic relationship or provide any literature reviews that support this claim? In my opinion,  LLMs itselves do not possess intentions, desires, or goals. They are tools designed to process and generate text based on patterns and data they have been trained on. They do not seek outcomes in the way humans or even economically rational agents might. Additionally, the use of \"most\" also implies there are some that are not.\n\n(2) In line 051, the paper mentioned the ABM relied heavily on models with preset rules, which often incorporated overly simplistic assumptions about agent behaviors and interactions.  Following this, the paper mentioned the advances in agent-based modeling without specifying what these advances entail. Later, in line 057, the discussion introduces neural networks, yet it is unclear how these networks relate to the previously mentioned agent-based topics. Additionally, the specific tasks these neural networks are intended to perform within this context are not clearly defined.\n\n(3) In figure 1, could you clarify which LLM generated this solution? When testing several LLMs, I've noticed that the results typically account for various situations across different scenarios or prompt me to provide more detailed background information or clarify my goals, rather than directly providing straightforward solutions.\n\n(4) In Figure 2, can you explain how the agent's preferences interact with environmental information.\n\n(5) In table 2, can you explain how did you use EconAI to predict inflaction, unemployment, saving rate and profit margin?\n\n(6) In Figure 5, do you have statistical evidence to illustrate the performance across each scenario?

                "value": "1. One weakness of the paper is that the clarity of the presentation could be significantly improved. \n  - Some of the concepts are introduced without providing concrete examples or detailed explanations, which leaves readers with an incomplete understanding of this core component, limiting the model's interpretability and practical applicability. For instance, the authors do not clarify what \"an economic plan\" entails in a concrete sense. It remains ambiguous whether the economic plan is a simple, modifiable prompt or a more sophisticated construct with a parametric structure that enables iterative updates. If the latter is true, it is unclear how this plan is actually updated\u2014whether through specific parameter adjustments, feedback from the environment, or internal decision-making criteria.\n  - The paper uses excessive and inconsistent notation, reducing clarity. For example, the action space is denoted as \"A\" on lines 238-239 but as \"\u03b5\" on lines 259-260. A flow chart covering all design elements mentioned in the paper would improve readability, providing a clear overview.\n\n2. The paper lacks sufficient implementation details in the method and experiment sections. While the framework\u2019s primary outputs are economic variables, the authors do not explain how these variables are aggregated and measured. Although agent design is discussed, the calculation of outputs remains unclear. Additionally, the paper does not specify the input data required for the framework, including prompt templates and parameters for the LLM, making it challenging to reproduce the results. Providing these details would enhance transparency and reproducibility.\n\n3. The authors do not provide an adequate evaluation of the framework\u2019s authenticity, nor do they critically assess its limitations. Subjective evaluations without comparison to real-world scenarios should be avoided. For example, in the ablation study (Section 5.4), the framework\u2019s \u201ctoo steady\u201d behavior is labeled unfavorably without objective criteria. Additionally, in Section 5.3, it is unclear how certain observed market strategies relate to enhanced economic simulation, as these strategies might already exist in the training corpus rather than emerging from the framework\u2019s modeling capabilities."

In comparison, this paper's main contribution lies in incorporating preferences into the agent by defining agent profiles and enhancing prompting. While the proposed prompting methods\u2014self-learning, self-reflection, and self-updating\u2014seems effective, they appear to be built upon well-established techniques such as ReAct [2] and reflection [3], which might somewhat limit the novelty of the contribution.\n\n- The author argues that the flaw in previous studies is assuming rational agents without human preferences. I think this isn't necessarily a flaw\u2014it depends on the research objective. Rational agents are suitable for economic equilibrium models, but if the goal is to study complex social interactions or behavioral economics, agents should reflect human-like preferences, which involves two key aspects: 1. Agent profile distribution: The distribution of agent attributes should reflect real-world demographics and economic conditions. The author's approach here is quite solid. 2. Authenticity of agent decisions: The author overlooks whether agents' decisions reflect real human preferences. While challenging to verify, some targeted analysis of the LLM\u2019s decision-making consistency would help.\n\n- Since EconAgent [1] already analyzed rule-based and RL-based baselines, I expect EconAI to show clear improvements. However, the results are very similar, and there\u2019s no detailed comparison or qualitative analysis between the two models.\n\n[1] Li N, Gao C, Li M, et al.
