    "abstract": "Transformer models excel in time series tasks due to their attention mechanisms. However, they often suffer from \"block-like\" attention patterns caused by high feature correlation, leading to feature confusion and reduced performance. In this study, we mathematically prove and quantify this limitation, demonstrating how it affects the sparsity of the attention matrix and hinders effective feature representation. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel, model-agnostic, and plug-and-play method called SEAT (Sparsification-Enhanced Attention Transformer) that leverages frequency domain sparsification. By transforming time series data into the frequency domain, our method induces inherent sparsity, reduces feature similarity, and mitigates block-like attention, allowing the attention mechanism to focus more precisely on relevant features. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of Transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency. This provides a mathematically grounded solution to inherent flaws in attention mechanisms, offering a versatile and effective approach for advancing time series analysis.",

According to Thm 1, the time series seems to be discretized and sparsified, in the perspective of transformer, the time(or frequency) interval of adjacent samples is not important. In Transformers, relative position matters more than absolute time points. Rather than that, the performance improvements might be due to the fact that as the time-seires get longer, the patterns of time series becomes regular, which means time series on frequency domain are clusterd, easily captured by transformer. Could the authors provide more insight on this perspective?\n- Could you explain under which conditions SEAT consistently outperforms or underperforms compared to other methods across different datasets?"

                "value": "So just to clarify, is it that the FFT is 2D FFT with the input $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times D}$ ? The output of the SEAT block is $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times L}$. Also,  in lines 341-347, it is not clear how the time domain (after IFFT and skip connection) representation is sparse. A frequency domain to time domain conversion need not necessarily produce a sparser output. How is it ensured that the output time domain representation will be sparse. Another question is where is the attention being applied in the SEAT block ? Is it in the Real Linear and Image Linear blocks ?\n\n\nDoes SEAT act as preprocessing step (that makes the time domain representation sparse) for the feature extractor which would then be used in the actual time series forecasting with standard (point/channel wise) attention ?\n\n\nTable 1 claims significant advantages of SEAT over baselines. This is also demonstrated through Figure 2. However, several scores are very close to corresponding baselines when SEAT is applied (such as PatchTST for ETTh1 and ETTm1). Further more, there is a lot of variation in performance when SEAT is applied. Therefore, it would be great to have comparisons to show why some of the methods show more improvements than others or why the others do not show similar improvements (very small change as seen in PatchTST). There are even methods that show a drop in performance, such as Informer and iTransformer for the traffic set.\n\n\nAs the input and output of SEAT block are both time domain signals it would be beneficial to have a before and after comparison of these signals to analyze what was removed as part of the process. \n\nIn lines 316-317, it is mentioned that SEAT enhances accuracy and robustness. It would be great to have experiments that drive this point. \n\nSome potential baseline that can be compared with SEAT are feature subset selection and feature disentanglement. These baselines can also help focus the attention mechanism on features that are important thereby potentially mitigating the block like attention pattern. The current experiments demonstrate that SEAT can be useful when added to an existing forecasting approach. However, it would also be useful to compare SEAT with other potential baselines such as those mentioned above.\n\n\nminor questions :\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to make it clear what $N$ and $F$ are in Equation 2. Is $F$ a subset of features from the window with size of $F$ being $N$ ?\n\nHow is $F$ chosen. This is in context of lines 211-212 where it is mentioned that a sparse attention mechanism yields a lower $Sim$ value. Isn't the value dependent of $F$. If so, then is the sparse attention mechanism providing a very different feature set? Also, it seems that lines 205-212 are related to channel wise attention. So is the sparse vs non-sparse comparison mentioned in this paragraph (and therefore $Sim$ calculation) based feature channels ?"
