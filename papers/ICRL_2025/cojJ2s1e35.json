    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative models have showcased their effectiveness across various domains such as language, chemistry, and genomics. However, these models often rely on discrete action representations or language-based interactions, limiting their ability to generalize across different environments without explicit labels. In this paper, we introduce the Object-Centric Algebraic Mental Model (OCAM), an unsupervised framework that learns a continuous latent action representation by combining object-centric representations with Lie group theory. OCAM treats actions as continuous operators acting linearly on a partitioned latent vector space corresponding to different objects and basic action axes. This approach allows OCAM to generalize beyond the environments it was trained on, enabling the simulation of new environments and efficient solving of inverse dynamics problems. We demonstrate that OCAM can learn interactive generative models from unlabeled video data, interpolate between frames, extrapolate long-term dynamics, and quickly adapt to new environments with minimal or no action labels. Experiments on benchmark datasets like PHYRE and ProcGen validate the effectiveness of OCAM in advancing the capabilities of scalable artificial general intelligence.",

To resolve the confusion, we elaborate our the defintiion and the role of $A$ in WLA with more formality.\n\nWe intentionally left the action space $\\mathcal{A}$ as abstract as possible, because it is meant to represent the set of \"controller inputs\" of an unknown interface.  At the minimum, let us assume that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a topological space. $\\mathcal{A}$ may depend on $\\mathcal{E}$, so that we shall more precisely write $A_E$ (please forgive us in writing this as $A_E$ in this response, because there is a problem with Markdown.)\nWith this in mind, let us elaborate on where $A_{E}$ stands in the WLA framework.\n\nLet $I=[0,T]$ be the time span and $C(I, A_E ) \\subset \\lbrace a |   I \\to A_E \\rbrace $ be the space of the control sequences. In an application, we are literally expecting each element of $C(I, A_E )$ to be the sequence of inputs from the controller interface. \nWe assume that there exists a controller interface map\n$Ctrl_E :   C(I, A_E) \\times  C(I, \\mathcal{X}) \\times I \\to  T_{id}G$\nwhere $T_{id}G$ is the tangent space of $G$ at $id$, or the Lie Algebra of $G$. Because $Ctrl_E$ is \"a controller\" whose effect depends only on the past,  we assume that $Ctrl_E(a, x, t)$ depends only on $a[0, t) = \\lbrace a(s) |  s \\in [0, t) \\rbrace$. Therefore let us  write  $Ctrl_E(a, x, t) :=  Ctrl_E(a[0, s), x[0, s))$. \n\nIt is for brevity we wrote $Ctrl_E : A_E \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to T_E$ in the manuscript to convey the idea that the controller input is mapped to transitions, but we are sorry if this caused confusion.  In the revised Appendix section, we will add more formal explanations as we presented here. \n\nIn the training of  $Ctrl_E$,  we are assuming a \"labeled\" sequential dataset of small size\n$D_{label} = \\lbrace (a_i, x^i)  \\rbrace_i \\subset C(I, A_E \\times \\mathcal{X}) $\nsuch that, with $(\\Phi, \\Psi)$ and $M$ in place, \n\n$$x^i(t) = \\Psi \\left( M \\left( \\exp \\left(  \\int_0^t Ctrl_E(a_i[0, s), x^i[0, s) ) ds  \\right) \\right) \\Phi (x^i(0)) \\right). $$\nThe purpose of Controller Interface Problem is to learn $Ctrl_E$ from $D_{label}$, as described in the manuscript.\nNote that, in this expression, we intend\n$\\exp \\left(  \\int_t^{t+\\delta} Ctrl_E(a_i[0, s) , x^i[0,s)) ds  \\right)$  to represent $g^i_{t, \\delta}$ in the first part of our response, so that \n$g^i_{t, \\delta}$ depends on $ \\lbrace Ctrl_E(a_i[0, s), x^i[0,s) | s \\in [t, t+\\delta) \\rbrace.  $"

                "value": "We are sorry that we forwent the details of the mathematical setups.  Our formal mathematical settings are mostly built on the theory of NFT (Koyama et al., 2024), except that we use continuous and nonstationary time series for training the model.  We provide more details in our response below.   In the revision, we will prepare an Appendix section with more rigorous notations and mathematical setups. \n\nPlease see the Part III for the summary of our responses.  \n\n\n## Regarding the assumption underlying WLA \nThis section is meant to serve as our response to Q1 (Ambiguity in Transition Operator  $g_{t, \\delta}$) and Q3 (Non-Compositional Transition Operators). To resolve the confusion, we will elaborate the assumption underlying WLA below with more formality.\n\n\nLet $D = \\lbrace x^i: [0, T] \\to \\mathcal{X} \\rbrace_i$ be the video dataset to be used to train the encoder $\\Phi$ and the decoder $\\Psi$ in our WLA framework, where $i$ is the sample index.  This dataset contains the videos sampled from multiple environments so $\\mathcal{X}$ is a superset of observation space of all environments. \nThe underlying assumption of WLA is that,  for every $i$, $t >0$ and $\\delta>0$,  the transition $x^i(t) \\to x^i(t+\\delta)$ is *realized* by *some* common group action $G \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{X}$ of a *some*  Lie Group $G$.  \nTo be more precise, our standing assumption is as follows: \n\n>**Assumption:** For our dataset $D= \\lbrace x^i: [0, T] \\to \\mathcal{X} \\rbrace_i$ \n>consisting of movie samples from multiple environments, there exists some Lie group $G$ that acts on $\\mathcal{X}$ through a group >action $\\alpha : G \\times \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{X}$ \n>such that,  for every $x^i$, $t >0$ and $\\delta$ there is some $g^i_{t , \\delta} \\in G$ such that $\\alpha ( g^i_{t , \\delta}, x^i(t) )  = >x^i(t+\\delta)$.  \n\nFor brevity, we notationally identified $g$ with the map $\\alpha_g: x \\mapsto \\alpha(g, x)$ ( that is, $g^i_{t , \\delta}:  \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{X}$  with  $g^i_{t , \\delta}(x^i(t)) = x^i(t+\\delta)$. ) We are sorry that the confusion might have been incurred by our typo of \"$\\to$\" in place of \"$\\mapsto$\".  We shall more correctly write $g^i_{t , \\delta}: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{X}$.  We will fix this typo in the revision. \nWith this assumption, we are therefore assuming that the family of transitions $T_\\mathcal{E}$ can be identified with a subset of $G$ for every $\\mathcal{E}$.  \n\nWe introduce this assumption of the Lie group structure as our inductive bias because our desiderata of compositionality and continuity matches (almost exactly, except for the invertibility) with the definition of Lie group as a topological set with smooth manifold structure and rules of compositions.  Note that, by leaving the group action and the details of $G$ unknown, we leave much freedom in our construction of the world model.\nWe do note however that we assume $G$ to be abelian in order to make the latent transitions computationally simple.\n\n\nAccording to the theory and results presented in NFT, when there is some group $G$ acting on $\\mathcal{X}$ with a set of reasonable regularity conditions,  there exists an autoencoder $(\\Phi, \\Psi)$ with latent vector space $V$ and a homomorphic map $M: G \\to Aut_{\\mathcal{R}}(V)$ such that $\\Phi ( M(g) \\Psi (x)) =  g(x)$.   Mitchel et al. (2024) and Miyato et al. (2023) had experimentally shown that such  $(\\Phi, \\Psi)$ and $M$ can be learned from a time series dataset, and our work scales their philosophy to the nonstationary, continuous dynamical system on large observation space.\nIn our manuscript, this $M: G \\to Aut_{\\mathcal{R}}(V)$  derived from $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ \nis written as $F_{\\Phi, \\Psi}:   G \\to Aut_{\\mathcal{R}}(V)$. \nAs for the expression around eq (3) in concern, the continuity part of our statement more precisely reads as follows:\n\n>**Continuity:** \n>When each continuous transition $x^i(t) \\to x^i(t + \\delta)$ is realized by a group element $g^i_{t , \\delta}$ so that \n>$\\Phi ( M(g_{t, \\delta}) \\Psi (x^i(t))) =  x^i(t + \\delta)$, then $\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} M(g_{t, \\delta}) = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} F_{\\Phi, \\Psi}(g_{t, \\delta})  \\to I$.  \n\nIn the revision we will strike out ambiguous expression like \"when the set of transitions form a Lie group\". \nWe chose the modeling of the transitions like (Koyama et al, Miyato et al and Mitchel et al) because (1) if $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are continuous and invertible, the compositionality and continuity of $M$ directly lift to the those of $G$'s action on $\\mathcal{X}$, and because (2) $M(g)$ for each $g$ can be represented by sparse (block diagonal) matrix that is computation-friendly (assuming that finite-dimensional representation space with sufficiently large dimension can reproduce the observations).    That is, we use $F_{\\Phi, \\Psi}$ as the environment-agnostic encryptor of the underlying transition operators."
