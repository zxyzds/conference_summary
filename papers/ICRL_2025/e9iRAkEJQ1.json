    "title": "Rate of Approximation by Flows: A Case Study on the Eikonal Equation",
    "abstract": "Previous works have demonstrated the universal approximation capability of residual networks through their continuous idealization as flow maps of dynamical systems. However, informative results on their approximation rates in terms of depth (corresponding to time) are generally lacking. From the viewpoint of approximation theory, a major difficulty in addressing this gap lies in identifying an appropriate target space for the approximation problem. In this paper, we introduce a restrictive but useful target function space comprised of solutions to the eikonal equations, a type of first-order nonlinear partial differential equation, to investigate the approximation rates of flow map families. We provide an estimate of the approximation error within this space, which is notably different from classical rate estimates based directly on the smoothness of target functions. This theoretical result further inspires a new learning-based algorithm for solving the eikonal equation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, including its robustness to spatial resolution and solution regularity, as well as transferability among similar problems.",

The error term that I am referring to is $E_{\\mathcal W}(V_u)=\\inf \\|W - \\tilde V_u\\|$.

I have some background in dynamical systems and ODEs but still found it hard to understand the ideas and the contributions.  I list some examples below, that I hope help the authors. This is not to say that the paper is not suitable for ICLR, but rather the way it is presented is unreadable for the ICLR audience. I used some of the cited papers to understand better the approach. I believe it should be presented more suitably for ML readers, in a self-contained way.\n- The theoretical contributions largely build on previous works and are not very involved. Moreover, the associated error if the flow does not follow the Eikonal equations is not characterized or discussed. The *Eikonal equations* are a special case of the *Hamilton-Jacobi Equation*, so focusing on the latter will give more general results.\n- The experiments focus on flows that follow the eikonal equation, and it is unclear to me how the approach works otherwise. \n\n# Structure\n- Some theorems are given in the related works section\n\n\n\n# Dynamical systems terms and difficult to follow\n- *flow idealization* -- appears first in the introduction, making it hard to understand the idea for an ML reader\n- *robustness to spacial resolution* is unclear in the abstract for people unfamiliar with the Eikonal Equation; perhaps it is better to explain in simple terms that is beneficial   \n- It is hard to understand how to implement the method proposed in Sec. 3. Provide steps or pseudo code that are self-contained. Explain the symbols in Figure 2 and repeat the most important notation in the caption. \n\n\n# Writing\n\n\n**Abstract.**\nAfter reading solely the abstract I could not understand the contributions. As a person not familiar with the Eikonal equation, I was confused. I hope this feedback helps improve it.\n-  The motivation posed in the abstract is the lack of approximation rates in terms of depth. The contributions as listed in the abstract are unclear on how they relate to this motivation--what is the rate shown in terms of depth? Please list the precise rate.\n- The text in the brackets \"(corresponding to time)\" is also not very clear. I suggest you avoid writing in brackets here and improve this part.\n- The last two sentences are unclear: I did not understand by this point that the goal is to solve the Eikonal equation. I also did not know that the spatial resolution needs to be specified and why we want to be robust to it.\n\n\n\n# Minor\n- typo line 203: will determined \n- use citing with brackets where appropriate"

The first is to propose the eikonal equation as a model of deep network dynamics, and the second is to consider deep learning as a solution technique for this class of PDEs.  Each contribution is thus allocated one half of the space, and this compression means that neither idea is explored very deeply.\n\nUnquestionably, the eikonal equation is a PDE of vast importance, in optics and far beyond.  Its connection to optimal control and to Hamilton-Jacobi theory suggests, but only very roughly, a possible connection to neural networks (ResNets), in particular as a way to study the effect of depth.  The authors do make clear (in Section 2) that this is not an entirely compelling connection (in the paragraph starting on line 189).  The problem, though, is that one is left without much conviction about the eikonal equation as a model.  The rest of the section is devoted to criticizing (rightly) smoothness-based approximations, but the criticism doesn't imply that the eikonal equation is the right way to proceed.  Further work is needed on this.\n\nIn section 3, the paper turns to a rather different class of problem, which is the numerical solution of the eikonal PDE via deep learning.  This material is better developed, but again one is left with a feeling that more work is needed.  The numerical solution of the eikonal equation is the subject of a vast literature, and the putative advantages of neural network solutions needs a more sustained investigation.  Also, the restriction to strong solutions is quite restrictive (as the authors are clear in pointing out)."
