    "title": "Generalizable Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging with Learnable Physical Priors",
    "abstract": "Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, recovering the hidden volume from indirect reflections, has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications. Despite promising results, existing NLOS reconstruction approaches are constrained by the reliance on empirical physical priors, e.g., single fixed path compensation. Moreover, these approaches still possess limited generalization ability, particularly when dealing with scenes at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome the above problems, we introduce a novel learning-based approach, comprising two key designs: Learnable Path Compensation (LPC) and Adaptive Phasor Field (APF). The LPC applies tailored path compensation coefficients to adapt to different objects in the scene, effectively reducing light wave attenuation, especially in distant regions. Meanwhile, the APF learns the precise Gaussian window of the illumination function for the phasor field, dynamically selecting the relevant spectrum band of the transient measurement. Experimental validations demonstrate that our proposed approach, only trained on synthetic data, exhibits the capability to seamlessly generalize across various real-world datasets captured by different imaging systems and characterized by low SNRs.",

                "value": "The paper proposes to learn the physical priors for  non-line-of-sight imaging. More specifically two components are proposed, learnable path compensation to attenuate the features to compensate for radiometric falloff and an adaptive bandpass filter to suppress background noise. Training and quantitative evaluations are done on synthetic data. Qualitative evaluations are done on real-world data including a three-scene dataset captured by the authors. The method shows better performance in terms of preserving sharp features and reducing background noise."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Though the method shows strong performance compared to baselines, I'm not sure the method is better for the reasons that the authors say, rather than just because the method has more parameters and is trained on more data than previous methods. In particular, the authors make several claims about why their method works better that I am not sure are precisely substantiated in the paper. \n\nFirst, the authors claim that the using adaptive coefficients for the radiometric intensity falloff is better because different materials will have different coefficients and their design can adapt to the varying materials. For example, diffuse objects should have a falloff coefficient of 4 and retro-reflective 2. While the authors do visualize in Figure 1 that their method using adaptive coefficients can recover both diffuse and retroreflective objects simultaneously, I could not find in the paper any visualizations of the compensation coefficients. I would recommend the authors include a image plot of the compensation coefficients, and would expect that regions per object would have their own coefficient each. \n\nSecond, the authors claim that the adaptive phasor field improves performance across a variety of SNR conditions. However, in Table 2, which contains the quantitative results across a variety of SNR conditions, the decrease in performance as SNR decreases for the author's proposed method is similar to the other methods. Thus, given the data presented in the paper it seems that it is not the case the author's proposed method is more robust in lower SNR conditions than other methods, despite having uniformly better performance across SNR settings. I'm not sure if it's because the SNR conditions in the testing sets are not varied enough, or if the adaptive phasor field doesn't actually help in diverse SNR settings. Regardless, I recommend that the authors provide some visualization of the standard deviations for the gaussian of the illumination phasor field predicted by their adaptive phasor field to better help the reader understand what the method is actually doing."

Specifically, I would expect for low SNR environments the standard deviation to be lower and vice versa, because low SNR implies higher noise and thus the model should use a tighter gaussian during wave propagation to filter out more noise. \n\nI would be willing to upgrade my score if the authors could provide more evidence that the method works the way they claim. \n\nMinor:\n- I don't quite understand in equation (8) why the inverse Fourier transform is taken, because according to Figure 2, $F_A$ goes through a Fourier transform before getting input into the wave propagation model. It seems to me to be more concise and efficient to keep the result of convolving the illumination phasor field with the compensated features in the frequency domain for wave propagation rather than transforming it back to the spatial/time domain.\n- For the real data at varying SNR levels, 10 dB, 5 dB, and 3 dB, how did the authors capture this data? I would expect that the exposure time is different between captures, but I couldn't see any details about this in the paper."

It can be any type of the light source function, such as ambient light. Please refer to Table S.2 of Liu\u2019s paper. Therefore, the physical explanation of learning a Gaussian window is not correct in my opinion. \n2.\tEven though some light source functions are Gaussian-shaped, such as pulsed point light function, the frequency spectrum band should be a certain value. It shouldn\u2019t be a changeable value for different scenarios. So, from this point of view, the explanation of learning a Gaussian window is also not correct.\n3.\tThe $I(x,y)$ in Eq.(3) should be the image of the virtual imaging system, it is not the hidden object as claimed in the paper, please refer to the explanation of Eq.(6) in Liu\u2019s paper.\n4.\tCould you explain in what dimensions of measurements you did the FFT to get the spectrum of the light source function? I think you can only get the spatial and temporal sampling frequency if you operate FFT on raw ToF measurement, rather than illumination spectrum.\n5.\tLines 78-79 claims that the proposed method can solve the dark counts noise of SPAD and ambient light. But I didn\u2019t find the detailed solution in the main paper. There is just a simple description of the definition in Eq.(4).\n6.\tWhy did you choose 3 path compensation weights? I didn\u2019t find the related content in O\u2019Toole et al., 2018. Could you clarify it for me?\n7.\tWhich method is chosen as your baseline in Fig.9. I suppose to be LFE according to Fig.2.
