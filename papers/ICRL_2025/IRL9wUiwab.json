    "title": "Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Time series foundation models promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models\u2014such as periodicity and trends\u2014and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, like adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled time series modeling.",

The representational analysis examined the representational similarity based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), identified concepts, and localized them to specific hidden states. The representation redundancy found in this analysis was used to prune the model, which reduces the model size as well as improves the inference speed. \n2.\tThe findings in this paper help us understand the TSFMs, and the knowledge can potentially be used to improve their capabilities. For example,  the predictions can be steered along the conceptual directions using synthetic time series."
