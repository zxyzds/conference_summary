    "title": "Groundwater Seepage Modeling in a River-Canal System based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Neural networks, especially deep learning, have achieved revolutionary advances in several domains, including image and speech recognition, with excellent results. However, their reliance on labeled data, lack of interpretability, and inconsistency with physical principles limit their applicability in groundwater seepage prediction and other scientific disciplines. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) significantly improve these issues by integrating physical knowledge with neural networks. This study focuses on modeling the groundwater flow field and proposes a physics-informed river-canal groundwater seepage model (PI-RGSM). This model enables self-supervised learning by incorporating hard constraints of boundary and initial conditions, utilizing hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions as direct inputs, thus diminishing dependence on observable data. Compared to the baseline PINNs, the PI-RGSM adapts to and accurately predicts diverse seepage situations with just one training session, achieving a mean coefficient of determination of 0.978. To further enhance applicability in complex dynamic groundwater seepage situations, we propose PI-RGSM-K, which builds upon PI-RGSM. This model simulates heterogeneous groundwater seepage fields and improves performance in complex seepage environments through parameterized hydraulic conductivity field $K(x,y)$ and fine-adjusted model architecture, attaining a mean coefficient of determination of 0.982. The physics-informed neural network models proposed in this study demonstrate exceptional efficacy in precisely forecasting groundwater seepage behavior.",

There are many extensions of the basic PINN that can be considered as additional baselines, along with operator learning methods such as FNO. It will be good to include visualizations of baselines along with PI-RGSM in the remaining tables and figures of the paper apart from Table 2.\n2. Dataset looks too simple. The visualizations show that the ground-truth profiles are smoothly varying in 2D spaces. It will be good to evaluate proposed methods on more complex scenarios. Also, more details about the compute time for training PINN and PI-RGSM on this dataset can be provided.\n3. Limited novelty of work. PI-RGSM seems to be a simple extension of PINN with the inclusion of hard constraints in the outputs. It will be useful to demonstrate if this idea is useful in general on problems outside of groundwater seepage modeling, including benchmark PDEs such as those available in PDEBench and PDEArena. \n4. Writing is not clear at several places and could be improved."

The paper mentions (in lines 167-169) that the main challenges in PINNs are the gradient pathologies with multiple loss terms, and the tedious nature of adjusting the trade-off hyper-parameters between these different terms. There is a rich body of work that addresses these challenges in PINNs, and should be used as baselines for comparison. Here are some of them: [1, 2, 3, 4] \n2. Lack of comparison with methods that can enforce hard boundary constraints [5] in PINNs.\n3. The \u201cInput feature fusion\u201d concept introduced in the paper is similar to the Neural Operators [6, 7, 8], where the ML model learns a family of PDEs instead of one single instantiation of a PDE. Therefore, the proposed PG-RGSM architecture seems like a simpler variant of the DeepONet [7] architecture, where both the coefficients and the spatio-temporal inputs are combined into one model instead of having a separate branch and trunk networks. Comparing against neural operators like DeepONets would further improve the paper. \n\n[1] Wang, S., Teng, Y., and Perdikaris, P.

If these methods have known limitations, why not compare them experimentally?\n3. It's better to define $\\mu$ and $t$ explicitly in Section 2.1 for clarity. \n4. The study uses randomly generated hydraulic conductivities and source/sink terms to enrich the training data. Is random generation commonly accepted in groundwater modeling, and does it effectively capture real-world scenarios?\n5. Do $\\phi$ and $\\varphi$ represent the same meaning in this paper? Their mixed usage leads to confusion.\n6. $H_{EC}$ is not clearly defined, nor is its role in the model explained.\n7. Why use $RES$ in section 2 while use $LOSS$ in section 3?\n8. Section 4.1 states, \"The experiment did not use observations,\" which conflicts with Section 2.2(4), which introduces observed data constraints. In addition, Section 2.2 is confusing since it introduces multiple terms while it looks like most of them ($RES_{BC}, RES_{IC}, RES_{OC}$) are not used in the experiments.\n9. Is there a specific reason for choosing $K=-0.01x+0.8$?\n\nSome minor suggestions:\n1. Use proper LaTeX notation for quotes: \\`\\`example text'' for left and right quotes.\n2. Figures 2 and 3 appear nearly identical. Consider combining them into a single figure that highlights the distinctions between PI-RGSM and PI-RGSM-K for conciseness."
