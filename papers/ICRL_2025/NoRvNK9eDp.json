    "title": "Level-Set Parameters: Novel Data for 3D Shape Analysis",
    "abstract": "3D shape analysis has been widely explored based on traditional 3D data of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis methods susceptible to variations in input resolutions. The recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivated us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. We demonstrate the potential of the novel continuous representation in pose-related shape analysis through applications to shape classification, retrieval under arbitrary poses, and 6D object pose estimation. Code and data in this research will be provided at github.",

The experimental section demonstrate tasks mostly belonging to point cloud processing, the motivation of leveraging SDF formulation is not justified.  \n\n- The exposition in Sec. 3.1 is poor, there is no motivation (or at least reference to existing works) on the formulation of hyper-network. Why is matrix-form entry necessary? How is it related to better encoding of rigid transforms? \n\n- Similarly, Sec. 4.1 threw a pile of architecture details on the readers without any reasoning. I found it hard to get why the network leads to semantic understanding of shapes. \n\n- The running time is not fully reported. It is only mentioned in the end of Sec. 5 that it takes 50 seconds for registration, which is clearly slow."

What does \u201cpseudo-normal distribution\u201d mean in Line 50, it is not clear from the context. \n\n3. The fairness of experimental results in Tab. 4 is not clear. Algorithm 2 essentially uniformly samples the rotation space, and chooses the best candidates of initialization. Did the authors implement the same for the baselines? \n\n4. In Tab. 3, the reported results for VN-DGCNN is way lower than the original paper [Deng et al. 2021]. Beyond that, why do PointNet and DGCNN, which are not pose equivariant, achieve such high score under SO(3)/SO(3)?"

The authors introduce a hypernetwork designed to transform input shapes by adjusting the level-set parameters of the 3D model in alignment with rotation and translation. This representation enables effective semantic shape analysis within the SO(3) space, offering an advantage over Euclidean-based transformations for continuous shapes. Experimental results demonstrate the method\u2019s effectiveness, showing improvements over prior techniques in tasks such as shape classification and pose estimation."

                "value": "Clarity and Presentation: The paper could benefit from improved clarity in communicating its main ideas. For example, the rationale behind certain design choices is not well-articulated, making it challenging to understand the intuition behind the approach. Specifically, Section 3.2 & 4.1 would benefit from a revision to enhance readability, as it is difficult to get an intuitive understanding of what is going on in these sections. Below are few of the points which need improvements: \n\n- In section 3.2, why a 2 stage approach for predicting the parameter decomposition is used? \n- Why trainable parameters are initialized as zero in line 236? \n- What is the intuition behind Equation (6)? \n- Many things in section 4.1 seems hard-coded. For e.g. What is the intuition behind concatenating the weights and biases of the first SDF layer? What is the intuition behind using parameters of only layer 2 and 7 of the SDF network? \n\nBecause of these points I feel section 3.2 and 4.1 needs a major rewrite. \n\nResults and Evaluation: The experimental results are presented on relatively simple datasets, such as ModelNet40 and ShapeNet. It would be valuable to evaluate the method on more complex, large-scale datasets like Objaverse to better assess its robustness and scalability. Will this method work in more modern datasets? Some quantitative or qualitative evaluation on these dataset is helpful. Given the relatively small improvements in quantitative comparison in Table 2 and 4, I have doubts about the robustness of this approach. And hence, a more extensive evaluation on complex datasets like Objaverse is required."

                "value": "1 Need to construct level-set parameters for each shape before shape analysis.\n\n2 Although the performance is improved, I feel that the proposed data modality complicates the task. Take the shape classification task as an example: traditional methods can directly take conventional data as input. However, with the proposed method, a dataset construction step is required. This involves using a Hypernetwork to generate the weights of another neural network (SDF), which is trained on traditional data modalities such as points and normals. Then, a specialized neural network (semantic learning network) needs to be designed to handle the large dimensionality of parameters as input for classification training. This reduces the flexibility in network design choices. Also, if users want to add new data or a new shape, they may need to retrain the Hypernetwork and SDF network. If so, this is time-consuming.\n\n3 The supervised methods in Table 2 are just PointNet and PointNet++. Although these methods are famous, they are also old methods. Please consider including more recent works. \n\n4 Table 2 should also consider reporting the number of parameters of each model for a fair comparison.\n\n5 PaRI-Conv's performance is as competitive as the proposed method in Tables 2 and 3.  PaRI-Conv even outperforms the proposed method in some categories in Table 2.\n\n6 I do not like this statement \"In addition, we observe that our classification network converges rapidly within a few epochs, consistent with the findings in (Dupontetal.,2022).\" The time of dataset construction should be taken into account.\n\n7 I feel it is too ambitious to propose a new data modality. If the focus of the paper is on a new data modality, I would expect more versatile shape analysis beyond just classification, pose estimation, and retrieval. Additionally, I would expect the modality to offer more flexibility for neural network development rather than requiring a specific encoder design. Furthermore, I would expect more groundbreaking improvements, but the enhancements in classification and retrieval are not significant."

However, with more and more shapes, can the network really handle them separately? For example, given fixed shape parameters and random pose input, it is hard to justify that the network will produce shapes with variance only in poses rather than shapes. Even if it is explicitly enforced during training, can the network inherit this capability during inference (especially when data scale become large).\n\nThird, as a decoder-only network, it seems that there is no possibility for it to handle novel shapes, which should be considered a big limitation.
