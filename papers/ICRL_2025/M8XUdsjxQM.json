    "abstract": "In high-dimensional settings, Bayesian optimization (BO) can be expensive and infeasible. The random embedding Bayesian optimization algorithm is commonly used to address high-dimensional BO challenges. However, this method relies on the effective subspace assumption on the optimization problem's objective function, which limits its applicability. \nIn this paper, we introduce Condensing-Expansion Projection Bayesian optimization (CEPBO), a novel random projection-based approach for high-dimensional BO that does not reply on the effective subspace assumption. The approach is both simple to implement and highly practical. We present two algorithms based on different random projection matrices: the Gaussian projection matrix and the hashing projection matrix.  Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing random embedding-based algorithms in most cases, achieving superior performance on high-dimensional BO problems.\nThe code is available in \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CEPBO-14429}.",

Bounce extends BAxUS to categorical and mixed domains. BAxUS even mitigates the needs of choosing effective dimension d, which makes the method more robust compared to REMBO, HeSBO and even ALEBO, which require a specific choice of d.

Can the authors explain why they did not consider using the pseudoinverse of A? In general, finding the pre-image is an ill-posed problem. The authors have to be cautious about using A^\\top.

It fails to include the latest embedding-based approaches such as CoBO [1], BAxUS [2], MAVE-BO [3], and DSO [4]. Additionally, other high-dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithms not based on embeddings, like Vanilla BO [5], and MCTS-VS [6], are also missing from the comparison. To my knowledge, TurBO [7] has demonstrated strong performance in handling high-dimensional optimization tasks, yet it is not included in the comparative experiments. \n\n- This paper merely demonstrates the feasibility of CEP (Formulas 2 and 3). Specifically, when the solution x is transformed into the solution \\tilde{x} through CEP, the authors prove the effect of d on the difference between x and \\tilde{x}. However, the selection of d directly affects the success probability of CEP, but how to determine the appropriate d is not discussed. From another perspective, in the method presented, the solution space is \\mathbb{R}^D, and the search subspace is \\mathbb{R}^d, which is a subspace of the solution space. The gap between these spaces is enormous, and for the optimal solution x^* \\in X, the probability of successfully finding the optimal solution in the subspace has not been proven or theoretically guaranteed, which is the key issue.\n\n- The experiment raises doubts about whether it was deliberately designed to create scenarios favorable to the algorithm. For example, in Figure 2, ALEBO did not converge on the Holder Table function, yet the results were truncated by the authors at 50 iterations. Similarly, the experiments on real-world problems involve dimensions no greater than 100, which cannot be considered as high-dimensional tasks. This raises doubts about whether CEPBO is truly capable of handling high-dimensional problems in practical applications.\n\n- Typos. Although I focused on the content of the article, I still found many typos. This paper needs to be carefully checked, otherwise it cannot be published. For example, there are two \"as\" in line 144. In line 233 (line 9 of Algo.1), the subscript t of y_t is incorrectly bolded (at the end of this line). \n\n- The paper was not well prepared, with the above typos and many other details.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The comparison methods are outdated, and the experiments are unconvincing. As mentioned in the \"weaknesses\", high-dimensional Bayesian optimization is a rapidly evolving field, with at least 60 highly relevant works published since 2013, including at least 20 based on embeddings. Comparing only with the older methods like REMBO and HesBO is insufficient, and even ALEBO, published in 2020, is no longer the state-of-the-art. Can the authors conduct thorough comparative experiments with relevant works (such as [1-7]) from the past three years to demonstrate the superior performance of CEPBO?\n\n2. Why did the authors limit the optimization in the benchmark function experiments to only 50 iterations? In Figure 2, ALEBO clearly does not converge on the Holder Table function. Does this seem fair and reasonable? Was the choice of 50 iterations deliberately designed by the authors?\n\n3. A key issue in high-dimensional BO is the choice of subspace dimension. The related work relies on \"whether the low-dimensional subspace can cover the effective subspace of the objective function\". Although CEPBO does not explicitly rely on the concept of effective dimensionality, the method is still influenced by the potential complexity of the objective function. In practice, the selection of the low-dimensional space (i.e., the setting of d) directly impacts the algorithm's performance, as d determines the proximity between x and \\tilde{x} in the Condensing-Expansion Projection. Although CEPBO relaxes the strong assumption of effective dimensionality, how to select d remains an unresolved issue. How do the authors address this problem?\n\n4. Another key issue in high-dimensional BO is the boundary issue, which is affected by the choice of subspace boundaries and embedding matrix. The embedding matrix in this paper is fixed, so I won't address that further here. However, in Section 3.4, why is the scaling factor chosen as \\sqrt{D}? From experience, I know that this is a crucial parameter, yet the authors have fixed it without providing any theoretical justification or hyperparameter analysis. I couldn\u2019t find a relevant explanation for this decision. One of the key factors affecting the embedding methods is the ability to determine the scale of the embedding according to the problem. How do the authors address this problem?\n\n5. The authors conducted experiments on 4 real-world problems. However, these problems are not high-dimensional tasks (the dimensions are 12, 14, 36, and 60 respectively). Could the authors add real-world high-dimensional tasks, such as problems with D > 200?\n\n6. A small question: do all the proofs in the appendix assume that x takes values in the real space \\mathbb{R}^D ? If the feasible domain of x is constrained, especially when it is not symmetric around the origin, do these theorems still hold?\n\n7. Based on the above question, intuitively, the Condensing-Expansion Projection may be influenced by the shape of the feasible domain. Could the authors provide additional experiments under different function characteristics, particularly with complex feasible domains? Test functions can be found at https://numbbo.github.io/coco/testsuites/bbob. \n\n8. Based on the current experimental results, when the function has an intrinsic effective dimension d_e, if the experimental setting uses d > d_e, other methods based on the effective dimension assumption maybe outperform CEPBO, which may affect the practicality of CEPBO. Could the authors add these experiments? If CEPBO can achieve good performance, this paper will be very exciting and practical!"
