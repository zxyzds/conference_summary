    "title": "Linear Spherical Sliced Optimal Transport: A Fast Metric for Comparing Spherical Data",
    "abstract": "Efficient comparison of spherical probability distributions becomes important in fields such as computer vision, geosciences, and medicine. Sliced optimal transport distances, such as spherical and stereographic spherical sliced Wasserstein distances, have recently been developed to address this need. These methods reduce the computational burden of optimal transport by slicing hyperspheres into one-dimensional projections, i.e., lines or circles. Concurrently, linear optimal transport has been proposed to embed distributions into $L^2$ spaces, where the $L^2$ distance approximates the optimal transport distance, thereby simplifying comparisons across multiple distributions. In this work, we introduce the Linear Spherical Sliced Optimal Transport (LSSOT) framework, which utilizes slicing to embed spherical distributions into $L^2$ spaces while preserving their intrinsic geometry, offering a computationally efficient metric for spherical probability measures. We establish the metricity of LSSOT and demonstrate its superior computational efficiency in applications such as cortical surface registration, 3D point cloud interpolation via gradient flow, and shape embedding. Our results demonstrate the significant computational benefits and high accuracy of LSSOT in these applications.",

The authors build on several valuable past works that aim to linearize or speed-up the optimal transport problem by restricting to specific domains. In their case, the spherical domain has extensive applications in computer vision and especially in neuroscience for problems of cortical surface registration. They demonstrate results on several applications including point cloud interpolation and cortical surface registration."

I appreciated the authors placing their work in the context of past work in sliced optimal transport and linear optimal transport. They elegantly combine aspects from both to develop the spherical OT framework. There is theoretical justification for the use of the LSSOT as a distance metric, and an efficient implementation for speed. The authors also demonstrate the utility of their method on several experiments, notably cortical surface registration, where working in a spherical domain is essential."

I appreciate the use of multiple datasets and outlining the problem of surface-to-atlas registration. The authors use extensive evaluation metrics. However, I have some concerns with the experimental setup and results.\n\nThe main purpose of these experiments was to quantify the improvement in performance and speed in using their metric over conventional ones. The authors state that they also use a Dice loss and regularization term. Did the authors perform new hyperparameter tuning on these losses when switching the image similarity metric? Failure to do so may bias results.\n\nWhy was only the sulcal depth used as a registration feature? Curvature is typically used and also offers a lot of information for registration.\n\nThe results on registration are puzzling. The authors' method performs considerably worse on SWD than the MSE loss for the NKI (Left hemisphere) and in MAE for NKI (Right hemisphere). Can the authors comment why? \n\nIn general, registration is an ill-posed problem, and one can modify the hyperparameters appropriately to either obtain very close matchings or well behaved fields. Can the authors discuss this and describe how this tradeoff was achieved. \n\nHow do these results compare to classical freesurfer registration? Which although is slow, represents a SOA in performance."

                "value": "This paper presents an elegant construction of the spherical sliced embedding in a linear sense. \n\nThe main strength of the paper is the clever extension of the sliced optimal transport and linear circular optimal transport to the case of spherical distributions. This is novel.\n\nThere exist other methods for computing distances between spherical distributions, for e.g. spherical sliced-Wasserstein, Stereographic sliced-Wasserstein which also allows to efficiently compute distances. Other works have achieved further computational efficiency due to the linear distance between the circular transport embeddings. In this paper, the authors first obtain an embedding of the spherical sliced measures P(S^{d-1}) and then define a distance between the measures as the linear circular optimal transport distance between the pushforward maps of the spherical measures. While this paper borrows and combines ideas from two earlier works, the novelty of this approach is that in this instance it is achieved for embeddings of spherical distributions. \n\nThe LSSOT distance is a pseudo-metric on P(S^{d\u22121}) as proven in an earlier work (spherical sliced Wasserstein), since they use the same notion of the distance. In this work the authors show that it is a well-defined metric for probability measures. Also see weakness. \n\nThe results of Theorems D.2 and D.3 and the corollary B.7 are important as they ensure that the pushforward maps can be written in terms of the Radpm transform operator R. \n\nThe paper is written in great detail and provides appropriate background for the concepts that are need to understand it. This is a strength. \n\nThe experimental results are somewhat comprehensive  and the authors do a good job of comparing their method with other spherical slicing methods (Wasserstein etc.). \n\nThe authors also provide a time complexity and runtime analysis and compare them to those with other related methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This is a minor weakness, but as mentioned in the strengths above, the LSSOT is a metric only for probability measures. Thus the data has to be first converted to distributions, which is both a lossy transformation (which the authors acknowledge). \n\nBy definition, the projection is not invertible. That is one cannot recover the original signal/shape. Again, this drawback exists for all the other methods, including those that the authors build upon. \n\nBecause of the above 2 points, when the authors present the interpolation results, they resort to an auto-encoder that projects the original data to the nearest point in the spherical latent space. Then to reconstruct the intermediate points along the interpolation path between the two signal, they need a decoder. This is similar to the backprojection approaches, which are not ideal. But again this is not a major weakness, but currently, this is the most convenient approach. \n\nIn addition to the above loss of information, the projection step (slicing) will also introduce further discrepancy. However, this is a drawback for all the slicing based methods (including spherical) that are mentioned in the paper. In this paper, the authors use the same idea as Bonet et al. 2023 for performing the projection. \n\nWhile the authors do provide algorithms for computing flows using Riemannian gradient descent, this is technically not a geodesic, but an approximation. \n\nThe notation for P^C (Equation 6) and P^U (Equation 7) gets confusing. The first one is a geodesic distance, while the second one is a projection."

                "value": "This question pertains to the original circular optimal transport construction, and the authors do not have to answer it here, as they do something different in this paper. However, out of interest, why is the COT distance defined in terms of c(x, y) uses min{|x\u2212y|,1 \u2212|x\u2212y|}? Can some other distance be used here? For e.g. min(arccos(<x, y>)). Is that the main difference between this earlier work and  the spherical sliced Wasserstein (SSW) approach? \n\n\nThe computational efficiency of this approach also naturally follows from the idea of slicing (projections on the great circle). Further efficiency is achieved by replacing the circular optimal transport distance by the linear version. However, can the authors provide slightly  more details on why the complexity of spherical sliced Wasserstein better than sliced Wasserstein? The projections on spheres should be more costly than lines. \n\nCan the authors comment on why LSSOT has better accuracy than SSW? Should SSW in fact perform as well as or better than LSSOT? \nFor SSW, the COT distance measures the discrepancy between the push-forward maps of the spherical measures, while LSSOT uses the LCOT distance. So there is yet one more embedding ( transport a reference measure to a target measure) performed. Does this result in loss of accuracy? Is this dataset dependent? Can the authors provide more detailed analysis or any ablation studies to explain this result? \n\nCan the authors expand more upon the injectivity of R? This is related to the results in theorems D.2 and D.3 and is inspired by the theorem in Bonet et al. 2024.  For e.g. the map R: L^1(S^{d\u22121}) \u2192 L^1(V_2(R^d) \u00d7S^1) is not injective everywhere, although it is true for absolutely continuous measures on the sphere. What are the implications when the operator R is applied in practice? This could be discussed more for the benefit of the reader."
