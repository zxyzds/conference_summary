    "title": "One-shot World Models Using a Transformer Trained on a Synthetic Prior",
    "abstract": "A World Model is a compressed spatial and temporal representation of a real world environment that allows one to train an agent or execute planning methods. However, world models are typically trained on observations from the real world environment, and they usually do not enable learning policies for other real environments. We propose One-Shot World Model (OSWM), a transformer world model that is learned in an in-context learning fashion from purely synthetic data sampled from a prior distribution. Our prior is composed of multiple randomly initialized neural networks, where each network models the dynamics of each state and reward dimension of a desired target environment. We adopt the supervised learning procedure of Prior-Fitted Networks by masking next-state and reward at random context positions and query OSWM to make probabilistic predictions based on the remaining transition context. During inference time, OSWM is able to quickly adapt to the dynamics of a simple grid world, as well as the CartPole gym and a custom control environment by providing 1k transition steps as context and is then able to successfully train environment-solving agent policies. However, transferring to more complex environments remains a challenge, currently. Despite these limitations, we see this work as an important stepping-stone in the pursuit of learning world models purely from synthetic data.",

Unlike traditional world models trained on environment observations, OSWM is pretrained entirely on synthetic data generated from a prior distribution composed of randomly initialised neural networks. OSWM can then be used as a world model for a given environment by leveraging in-context learning. Experiments demonstrate OSWM's ability to train RL agents that solve simple environments like GridWorld, CartPole, and a custom control task. However, the model struggles with more complex environments."

Section 3.2 mentions the NN prior and the momentum prior are concatenated. But Fig 1 shows that the entire state vector $x_t = [s_t^{1:d_s}, a_t^{1:d_a}$ so $x_t$ is just the NN prior, so where is the momentum prior concatenated? I do not see $v_t$ or $p_t$ in Fig 1."

At inference, the model is provided 1000 transitions from the target environment and the RL policy is trained entirely in the OSWM generated data.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I wonder if it is right to call the model a one-shot model. During inference the model uses 1000 transitions as in-context examples which may comprised different number of episodes depending on the environment. In some cases, the environment maybe non-episodic. In general 1-shot refers to using 1 in-context examples. I believe calling 1000 transitions as one in-context example can be a bit misleading. Maybe a more general term would be few-shot or in-context world models?\n- A more thorough analysis of the strength of the world model and its implications on the downstream tasks would be nice to have for the paper. For example, in table 3 the authors compare various sampling strategies for in-context learning and then select the best one (based on mse) for reporting results in table 2 (left). However it is not clear whether better mse on the 1500 held out transitions does always lead to better downstream RL performance? It would be nice to have an analysis comparing the world model performance and the corresponding downstream RL performance. \n- It seems that for each dimension of the state space, a different neural network is used. This seems very limiting as the different dimensions of the state space in the synthetic data may lack global consistency and may thus affect rl performance. I wonder if the authors have tried more sophisticated networks that produce the whole state using a single network. Also I wonder if the authors tried using a recurrent network for generating consecutive states in the synthetic data?\n- I believe one baseline that would be good to have is what if you train a world model on the 1000 in-context transitions used during inference and then learn an RL policy based on that world model. This baseline would shed more light on the effectiveness of synthetic data."

                "value": "1. In my opinion this paper falls more on the empirical contributions spectrum. Through that lens I find the presented results too limited and not sufficiently impactful. At this stage, the work shows signs of life but needs more convincing results on more difficult tasks in order to have the impact on the scientific community. For example, there has been world model work which assumes certain properties in the deepmind control suite [Hao et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02817) and gets superb sample efficiency and similar examples in manipulation such as [Biza et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05333). I would suggest aiming for that level of task complexity.\n2. For the proposed method to work sufficiently well, it requires context data from a distribution of policies with different performances. This is a fundamental limitation which makes the application of this approach to true RL problems very limited. However, I do acknowledge that it is still applicable to low-data regimes such as imitation learning.\n3. The paper will benefit from a more concise presentation. Certain sections, particularly 3, 4.1, could be streamlined to emphasize key findings and enhance readability. A tighter structure might help maintain reader engagement and highlight the study\u2019s core contributions more effectively. If you intend to keep the paper content as is, I would recommend fitting it within 6 pages (which is perfectly acceptable this year).\n4. While the paper idea is novel and unique, I feel that the baselines and evaluations could be improved. Currently the paper uses PPO as the upper bound and a random policy as the lower bound in Table 1. Then it simply poses the question, where does our method stand but doesn't really compare properties of the algorithm. For example, one could compare sample efficiency vs standard baselines such as Dreamer or very sample efficient world models such as ED2  [Hao et al, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02817). On the other hand, since the proposed method is using data from a mixture of policies, it would also be worthwhile to compare against offline trained world models such as TDMPC2 [(Hansen et al. 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16828) or PWM [(Georgiev et al. 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02466).\n5. The experiment in Section 4.2 provides an unfair comparison as it changes the type of context in Table 2, effectively selecting the best hyper-parameters per task. Doing this limits the generalizability of your approach and makes it unclear what context selecting strategy is the best.\n\nMinor commnets:\n1. Line 039 states that transformers have pushed the boundaries of world models. However, at least in the cited RL applications, I (and many colleagues) find that transformers have not shown sufficient improvements over simpler models such as MLPs. As such I found this claim false and misleading to readers.\n2. I find the first paragraph of your related work to be unnecessarily long. I would recommend only referencing work that (1) shows a need for learning better world models or (2) is directly relevant to yours.\n3. The ablation in Section 4.2 is very interesting. I'd encourage you to bring Table 3 into to main text. Additionally, 'Improved Context' is difficult to understand from the text\n4. Some figures are difficult to read. As a rule of thumb, try to have text in figures to be roughly the same size as your main text."

Learning entirely from synthetic data is an interesting idea and problem constraint but have you also considered applications of your approach to extremely limited data regimes?

Have you explored the direction of fine-tuning your world model as you interact with the environment similar to a standard MBRL algorithm.\n3. The decision to use a full transformer encoder-decoder is a bit uncommon and unmotivated. Why did you decide on that?"
