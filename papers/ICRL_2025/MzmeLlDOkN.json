    "title": "MIGA: Mixture-of-Experts with Group Aggregation for Stock Market Prediction",
    "abstract": "Stock market prediction has remained an extremely challenging problem for many\ndecades owing to its inherent high volatility and low information noisy ratio.\nExisting solutions based on machine learning or deep learning demonstrate superior\nperformance by employing a single model trained on the entire stock dataset to\ngenerate predictions across all types of stocks. However, due to the significant\nvariations in stock styles and market trends, a single end-to-end model struggles to\nfully capture the differences in these stylized stock features, leading to relatively\ninaccurate predictions for all types of stocks. In this paper, we present MIGA, a\nnovel Mixture of Expert with Group Aggregation framework designed to generate\nspecialized predictions for stocks with different styles of by dynamically switching\nbetween distinct style experts. To promote collaboration among different experts\nin MIGA, we propose a novel inner group attention architecture, enabling experts\nwithin the same group to share information and thereby enhancing the overall\nperformance of all experts. As a result, MIGA significantly outperforms other\nend-to-end models on three Chinese Stock Index benchmarks including CSI300,\nCSI500 and CSI1000. Notably, MIGA-Conv reaches 24 % excess annual return on\nCSI300 benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model by 8% absolute.\nFurthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mixture of experts for stock\nmarket prediction, providing valuable insights for future research.",

In particular, Figure 3 is only\nbriefly discussed in the text.

Correct me if I'm wrong, the contributions of MIGA based on Alphamix are: (1) the router which filters out some of the experts. (2) the inner group aggregation module. I suppose the novelty of MIGA in the existence of Alphamix is limited. By the way, I recommend to include Alphamix as one of the baseline models.\n\n2. It seems that statistics in Table 3 can't illustrate the effectiveness of the inner group attention, which is one of the new modules proposed. Some of the metrics are on par, some metrics even degrade. This ablation study doesn't provide a strong support to the main claim of the paper. The authors are suggested to report the statistical significance of Table 3.\n\n3.  The related work section is short, and many works [2~5] in the field are missing.\n\n[1] Sun et al.
