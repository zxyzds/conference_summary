    "abstract": "We study the role of _contextual information_ in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders.\nAt each round, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade.\nThe broker suggests a trading price based on contextual data about the asset.\nThen, the traders decide to buy or sell depending on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price.\nWe assume the market value of traded assets is an unknown linear function of a $d$-dimensional vector representing the contextual information available to the broker. Additionally, at each time step, we model traders' valuations as independent bounded zero-mean perturbations of the asset's current market value, allowing for potentially different unknown distributions across traders and time steps.\nConsistently with the existing online learning literature, we evaluate the performance of a learning algorithm with the regret with respect to the _gain from trade_.\nIf the noise distributions admit densities bounded by some constant $L$, then, for any time horizon $T$:\n\n- If the agents' valuations are revealed after each interaction, we provide an algorithm achieving $O ( L d \\ln T )$ regret, and show a corresponding matching lower bound of $\\Omega( Ld \\ln T )$.\n\n- If only their willingness to sell or buy at the proposed price is revealed after each interaction, we provide an algorithm achieving $O( \\sqrt{LdT \\ln T })$ regret, and show that this rate is optimal (up to logarithmic factors), via a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{LdT})$.\n\nTo complete the picture, we show that if the bounded density assumption is lifted, then the problem becomes unlearnable, even with full feedback.",

                "value": "This paper discusses online bandit learning for bilateral trade and is largely a follow-up to [1]. In this brokerage game, a buyer and seller share equal valuations on average, and it is the strategy of the broker to set the brokerage price, $ p $, as close as possible to this amount, $ m $, to maximize the \"gain from trade.\" A sale only occurs when $ p $ falls between realized values $ V $ and $ W $, which are random variables distributed around $ m $. This repeated online learning setting was investigated in [1], and the current work adds a context that causally affects $ E[m] $ via a set of $ d $ parameters. The paper presents two problem settings identical to [1]: full-feedback, where the realized valuations of the buyer and seller are revealed to the agent, and two-bit feedback, where only whether a sale occurred is revealed, making it more challenging. Two algorithms based on ridge regression are proposed to address this problem, each providing logarithmic regret bounds. Additional theorems establish a lower bound on regret under specific revelation of context sequences, and the final theorem, Theorem 5, addresses the (un)learnability of this problem when a core bounded probability assumption is lifted.\n\n[1] Boli\u0107, Nata\u0161a, Tommaso Cesari, and Roberto Colomboni. \"An online learning theory of brokerage.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.12107 (2023)."

However, from my perspective, the assumption of a finite $ L $ in a bounded interval is quite mild, and it's safe to say that most random distributions in this economic setting would adhere to it."

                "value": "- The major weakness is the level of contribution compared to previous work [1] and the amount of verbatim text copied from one document to another. As mentioned, the problem setting is almost identical, except that additional context is provided. A word-for-word comparison between the two documents shows high similarity scores for the first half of the document. If this is a follow-up to [1], it should be stated more clearly, and some redundancy could be reduced by not rewriting the exact same language from [1] in the current draft.\n- In reviewing the theoretical results, there seems to be some repetition: Lemma 1 provides the same result as Thm 2.3 in [1], and Theorems 1 and 3 demonstrate almost identical regret bounds as Algorithm 1 and 2 in [1], albeit with different algorithms and arguments. This somewhat reduces the degree of contribution, as adding context to the same problem as [1] results in finding a new algorithm that retains nearly identical regret bounds as [1], which makes the result rather incremental.\n- Economic assumptions: The assumption that both the buyer and seller have the exact same valuation seems somewhat unrealistic. Isn\u2019t it generally the case that, in markets, parties value goods differently? Furthermore, why should agents act under a true valuation? Could they not be strategic in their decisions? It also appears that the broker is entirely altruistic\u2014facilitating a trade but seemingly not profiting from it."

So, could $ p $ be a range rather than a single point, and what impact would this have on the current work?\n- What would happen if the buyer and seller did not declare their prices truthfully? (This is more of an extension question, but in an open market, this seems like the more common case.)\n- Since Lemma 1 reaches the same conclusion as Thm 2.3 in [1], couldn\u2019t we simply use the result from [1]?\n- Why must the buyer and seller have the same valuation? Could $ E[V] \\neq E[W] $?\n- If I understand correctly, Thms. 2 and 4 state that it\u2019s impossible to have sub-logarithmic performance guarantees for a specific sequence of contexts. In what ways is this significant to the paper? And how could it be relevant for future work?"

The the reward of each interaction is the sum of the net utilities of the traders, known as gain from trade. The goal of the learner is to minimize the regret with respect to the best function of the contexts.

                "value": "My major critique of the paper arises from it's conceptual model of the OTC marketplace and the additional insights it provides compared to existing literature. \n\n- In \"A Regret Analysis of Bilateral Trade\" (Cesa-Bianchi, 2021) at each time step a (buyer, seller) pair arrives, with the buyer having maximum valuation $b_t$ and seller having minimum valuation $s_t$. It is clear that a trade happens if the proposed price $p_t \\in [s_t, b_t]$. In this paper, however, the role of the buyer and seller are not determined. Two parties arrive, and depending on the p_t given, either could be a buyer or seller. This is quite strange and only really makes sense if both traders own the underlying asset - so either can be the seller. I am not sure how to justify this/be on board with this model and realistic this is in OTC markets.\n\n- In this model, both trader's valuation arise from a stochastic process, which in expectation, is equal to the market price, which is crucially consistent with the context observed by the learner. So $E[V_t] = E[W_t] = m_t = \\langle c_t, \\phi \\rangle$. This is also quite a strange and strong assumption; this notion of an expected ground truth market price agreed both buyer and seller parties is not present in (Cesa-Bianchi, 2021). In general, market price arises endogenously due to trading between different parties with possibly heterogenous expected valuations. Am I correct to say that if both traders are highly concentrated (low variance), then the GFT should be very small since they both have the same EV? Moreover, it requires consistency with the learner's context. On theoretical models, I am happy to be lenient with assumptions, but I worry that in this case, it does not provide any more natural insights or technical benefits over what is currently proposed in the literature (see below):\n\n- I am trying to understand the novelty or additional insight this paper provides over \"An Online Learning Theory of Brokerage\" (Bolic, 2024), which the authors cite. That paper does not make a contextual assumption, nor do they make an assumption about mean of the trader's distribution - however, they assume both traders valuations are from same fixed distribution. In this model, trader's don't need to have the same distribution, but the same mean, which is consistent with the market price the context reveals. Beyond these differences, the model is nearly identical and the bounds achieved are also identical. I am not sure if the different distributional assumption can truly be justified as loosening the model since it requires an additional sort of internal consistency with the context - $E[V_t] = E[W_t] = m_t = \\langle c_t, \\phi \\rangle$. I understand why this assumption is made from a technical/learning perspective, but conceptually, I don't see any immediate reasons to think this model is more natural than the one in (Bolic, 2024) or (Cesa Bianchi, 2021) which clearly delineates buyers and sellers, both of which give similar bounds. \n\n- Why use this strange notation for $a \\wedge b$ denoting $min(a, b)$ and $a \\vee b$ denoting $max(a,b)$? Makes it much harder to parse."
