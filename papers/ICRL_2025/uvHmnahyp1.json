    "abstract": "Generative models see increasing use in computer-aided drug design. However, while performing well at capturing distributions of molecular motifs, they often produce synthetically inaccessible molecules. To address this, we introduce SynFlowNet, a GFlowNet model whose action space uses chemical reactions and buyable reactants to sequentially build new molecules. By incorporating forward synthesis as an explicit constraint of the generative mechanism, we aim at bridging the gap between in silico molecular generation and real world synthesis capabilities. We evaluate our approach using synthetic accessibility scores and an independent retrosynthesis tool to assess the synthesizability of our compounds, and motivate the choice of GFlowNets through considerable improvement in sample diversity compared to baselines. Additionally, we identify challenges with reaction encodings that can complicate traversal of the MDP in the backward direction. To address this, we introduce various strategies for learning the GFlowNet backward policy and thus demonstrate how additional constraints can be integrated into the GFlowNet MDP framework. This approach enables our model to successfully identify synthesis pathways for previously unseen molecules.",

                "value": "It was a pleasure to review this paper on synthesizability-constrained molecular generation using GFlowNets. Overall, I felt the paper was strong and focuses on an important application area of generative models, it was well-written, and generally builds well on previous work in the field and introduces some novelty. In my review below, I focus on aspects and unresolved questions that, if addressed, could enhance the paper. I summarize my main concerns as: (1) in its current state, the work is not reproducible, and (2) the evaluation metrics and comparisons to prior work used in evaluating SynFlowNet are not always the most relevant for molecular design, and do not tell us much about how this method would actually perform in a realistic setting. There is room for improvement here. I think this paper has the potential to be a really strong paper if it addresses the concerns below."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* I searched throughout the paper and in the submission, and could not find any code to accompany the paper. Given that the authors lamented the lack of publicly-available code for two previous works in their paper, I would have expected a greater emphasis on publishing the code here, as it would also help with the reproducibility of this work. To me this is unacceptable for a computer science conference submission in 2024, so please let me know if I simply missed it, and I can raise my score (I ranked it below the acceptance threshold because of this, and would update my score if the code was made available as it was overall a good paper).\n* Throughout the paper, the authors repeat that one of the key advantages of SynFlowNet is its ability to generate more diverse candidates than other methods (namely, REINVENT and SyntheMol). However, I argue that diversity is only a meaningful metric in molecular generative models if the types of molecules being generated are from the accessible molecular space; if the generated molecules are diverse but not accessible, then the model is not very practically useful. That being said, it was good the the authors evaluated synthesizability using AiZynthFinder, but an \"easy\" experiment that the authors could have also done that would add a lot of value is to consider molecular rediscovery benchmarks. That is, can the model also find known, previously-synthesized binders; celecoxib rediscovery is a widely-used standard benchmark for this, but there are also more challenging targets. Such rediscovery metrics are a nice alternative to experimental validation which is not necessarily possible on the review timeline. To summarize, I would like to know that SynFlowNet can generate diverse and *known* synthesizable molecules, not just diverse *predicted* synthesizable molecules, because at the end of the day CASP tools are not a replacement for experiment.\n* I found the lack of comparison to other methods for synthesizability-constrained molecular generation a weakness. The authors mentioned that the models of Gottipati and Horwood & Noutahi were not publicly available, and thus focused on comparison to SyntheMol and REINVENT. While these comparisons were interesting and certainly well-motivated, I would have also liked to know how SynFlowNet compares to other synthesizability-constrained molecular generation models which *do* have publicly available codebases, like MoleculeChef or SynNet. As it stands, we do not know which model is best, because SyntheMol has not done any comparisons to those models either.\n* In the Appendix, the authors state that 300K oracle calls were used both to train REINVENT and SynFlowNet, however, this is an extreme number of oracle calls; can the authors justify this? REINVENT demonstrates good performance after only 10K oracle calls for most objectives, so are 300K oracle calls simply what is needed for good performance in SynFlowNet? I would like to see the analogous experiments and comparisons/results with only 10K oracle calls, which is the standard number of oracle calls used for comparing molecular generative models."

                "value": "* I could not find how $s_0$ is initialized, nor how important this is (i.e., how different initializations here impact the performance of SynFlowNet). Can the authors clarify? Does it correspond to a molecular fingerprint/embedding of the target molecule, is it random noise, or something else?\n* One of the contributions of this paper is stated as \"we propose one of the first attempts at training the backward policy in a GFlowNet with a separate objective from for the forward policy, which we show to correct backward-generated trajectories and improve sample quality and diversity\" but I am not sure I got that. Which experiment was it exactly that demonstrated the new backward policy led to improved sample quality/diversity? Are these results in the paper? If so this needs to be clarified.\n* How sample efficient is SynFlowNet? I would have liked to see an analysis of this, which is really important for molecular generation tasks as we are almost always operating in the low data regime and data/sample efficiency is key.\n* How does SynFlowNet perform when optimizing for targets that are highly symmetric, e.g., molecules with a Cn rotation axis, where n$\\ge$2? Has this been evaluated? This is something that is a known weakness of other synthesizability-constrained molecular generation frameworks (e.g., SynNet). \n* What are the failure modes of SynFlowNet? This should be more thoughtfully analyzed, as all models have failure modes and it is important to understand them to help future research build on the results of SynFlowNet.\n* How challenging would it be to expand SynFlowNet beyond bi-molecular reactions? I am not suggesting this should have been done here, but asking more from curiousity and wondering if this is a future direction the authors are aiming to explore in future work.\n\nMinor:\n* Are the points in Figure 6 (last panel) shuffled for plotting? It was not clear to me if there are red points under the blue ones or vice-versa. This should be clarified as the results from this plot are informing the conclusions.\n* The references are poorly formatted, this should be fixed.\n* gsk3$\\beta$ should be GSK3$\\beta$ (weird capitalization in the Appendix)."

Specifically, they formulated a molecular design problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) that successively adds a purchasable building block (BB) with a selected reaction to the previous state. A GFlowNet has been adopted to tackle the MDP. Namely, SynFlowNet shows better performance in improving the diversity and high reward modes simultaneously, whereas conventional optimization approaches like reinforcement learning only focus on the highest reward modes. To handle more BBs, they are represented with binary Morgan fingerprints, and the probability of sampling a particular BB is computed as a function of its fingerprint and the embedding vector of the current state. In addition,  new backward policies have been tested to ensure that the backward trajectories can return to existing building blocks. They also performed a case study that leverages experimental data for more efficient drug design as a practical application. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, but several issues need to be addressed."

                "value": "1. In Table 1, while the two backward policies, the Maxlikelihood and REINFORCE, show relatively high ratios of the solved routes in both the training and test sets, their number of high reward modes is similar to that of the Uniform Policy. This result is rather disappointing, considering the objective of the generative model is to sample more high-reward modes. In this context, the authors need to discuss the effect of the proposed backward policies on the performance of the forward policy in more detail.\n2. In Figure 4, lower rewards achieved by FragGFN and FragGFN SA seem questionable because FragGFN covers a much larger chemical space, as seen from Figure 2, and so is more likely to find molecules with higher rewards. Has the poor performance of FragGFN originated from insufficient training? Or is it because of the use of SeH proxy as a reward, which may have a severe generalization problem for unseen molecules? This should be justified in the revision. \n3. In Section 4.1, what is the rewarding strategy used for multi-objective optimization (FragGFN SA, SynFlowNet SA, SynFlowNet QED)? The possible reward structures could be Multi-objective GFlowNet (MOGFN) or multiplication-based rewards.\n4. Regarding the metric Reward/Novelty trade-off, it is possible that improving the novelty for SynFlowNet may be simply due to the use of the Enamine building blocks, while REINVENT has been trained with ChEMBL. Thus, the high similarity of the molecules generated by REINVENT to ChEMBL is not unexpected and would be reduced if training it with the Enamine REAL. The authors need to address this issue."

SynFlowNet introduces a backward policy for navigating reaction trajectories, improving synthetic feasibility and sampling accuracy. By utilizing molecular fingerprints and scalable building blocks, SynFlowNet can explore vast chemical spaces efficiently, making it adaptable for specific drug targets when provided with experimental fragment screening data, such as in SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors."

[4] introduced action embedding into GFlowNet and investigated its effectiveness in large action spaces.\nWhile the authors use a different fingerprint representation (Morgan fingerprints instead of MACCS fingerprints), Gottipati et al. [2] have already evaluated various representations, including both fingerprints.\nAuthors should highlight the novel differences from existing approaches or provide appropriate citations.\n\n**Issue 2: Lack of experimental details.** Section 4.1 and Section 4.5\n- In Section 4.1, what is the rewarding strategy used for multi-objective optimization (FragGFN SA, SynFlowNet SA, SynFlowNet QED)? The possible reward structures could be Multi-objective GFlowNet (MOGFN) [5] or multiplication-based rewards [6].\n- In Section 4.5, I couldn't find the experimental details. The related section is on Page 19, Section A.5, but it does not provide crucial information about this experiment. I suggest to include experimental details and mention it like Section 4.6.\n  - Reward Function: What reward function was used in the ablation studies? Is it sEH?\n  - Average Times: Clarify what *average times* refers to\u2013e.g., runtime per batch or runtime per molecule.\n  - For Figure 7 D-F, entire building block set is used?\n\n**Issue 3: Fairness of evaluation metric.** Page 8, Figure 6\n\nThe improvement in the reward/diversity trade-off is impressive, but I have questions about the metric, **Reward/Novelty trade-off**.\nRegarding the Reward/Novelty trade-off, it is possible that the improvement in novelty is due to the use of the Enamine building blocks rather than the effectiveness of well-structured generative model architecture.\nIn this case, the REINVENT's high similarity to ChEMBL would be greatly reduced by simply retraining it on Enamine REAL or ZINC.\n\nFor a fair comparison in terms of novelty, the comparison should be performed on the same exploration space:\n- Train REINVENT on Enamine REAL.\n- Use ChEMBL-like building blocks, such as blocks obtained from the retrosynthetic decomposition [3] of ChEMBL molecules.\n\n**Issue 4: Limited comparative study.** Sections 4.2 and 4.3\n\nThe comparison between the proposed method and baselines was performed only on proxy models.\nI recognize that proxy models such as sEH [7] are widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization strategies in the optimization community [8], so I think this is a minor issue.\nHowever, I have concerns about the appropriateness of evaluating and comparing the performance of discovering novel molecules based on proxy models trained on a restricted and known chemical space.\n\n**Issue 5: Restricted scalability to a large building block set.** section 4.5\n\nI definitely agree with the argument for employing an extensive building block (BB) set to explore the vast chemical space.\nI believe that it can mitigate the reward-diversity trade-off by expanding the sample space.\nHowever, I concern that the current experimental results do not seem to provide sufficient evidence about this argument and the scalability of SynFlowNet.\n\nThe authors demonstrated that a larger BB set yielded a higher selection of unique BBs (Figure 7B), but this has a negative impact on the average reward (Figure 7A) and speed (Figure 7C).\nConsequently, the current findings seem to emphasize the negative effects of the usage of extensive BB sets on the quality and throughput for generation.\nTo justify the significance of utilization of unique BBs, I suggest including structural diversity metrics for generated samples, such as the number of unique Bemis-Murcko scaffolds or the average pairwise Tanimoto distance.\n\n---\n**Reference**\n1.
