    "title": "An Intelligent Agentic System for Complex Image Restoration Problems",
    "abstract": "Real-world image restoration (IR) is inherently complex and often requires combining multiple specialized models to address diverse degradations. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.",

                "value": "This paper presents an agentic workflow based on LLM/VLMs for image restoration. The agentic system follows how actual humans would process images, consisting of five stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. Since the existing VLMs are not sufficiently capable of analyzing image quality or reasoning about the order of image processing tasks, the VLMs are finetuned and allowed for (self-)exploration to understand the effects of scheduling the image restoration components. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effects of scheduling with learned experience and the other proposed components."

                "value": "1. Clear presentation of the benefits of the proposed methodologies. I especially liked Figure 3, 6, 7, and 8, where the authors show dramatic improvements on why choosing a good scheduler for the image restoration components is important, as well as reflection and rollback.\n\n2. Novelty in connecting the human process of IR with LLM-based agentic systems. Though the idea of mimicking the human workflow is being widely adopted more recently, application to image restoration tasks and showing effectiveness is not demonstrated before, to my knowledge.\n\n3. Thorough justification of the design choices and careful experiment designs. Reasons for the proposed workflow and the capabilities the authors are trying to give to the LLM/VLMs are well described, and the evaluations seem to be fairly performed."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. No cost analysis. Using such agentic systems require numerous requests to the LLM/VLM APIs; if the system chooses to perform \"Reflection\" with the tree search, the worst case scenario would be extremely costly. Compared to the existing image restoration models, the proposed model uses significantly more compute. In this sense, given that many previous works (roughly) match the FLOPs when comparing the restoration quality, one might argue that the comparisons are unfair.\n\n2. Relatively subtle improvements for quantitative metrics (though qualitative improvements look quite significant). I would suggest also adding quantitative measures on the figures so that the readers can compare both aspects with a single glance."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How are the discovered workflows similar to the original motivation of following the human workflow? For instance, is the subtask scheduling by GPT-4 (w. experience) match the best practices performed by a human? It would be better if the authors could provide more insights or discussions.\n\n2. How does the proposed model perform when there is only a single type of degradation? Does it also perform competitively?\n\n3. What is the criterion for deciding whether Execution step is Failed or Successful? (I might have missed)"

                "value": "1. **Comparison fairness**: The comparative experiments appear to lack fairness, as the baselines (e.g., InstructIR) are designed as unified IR models trained to handle multiple degradation types in a single framework. In contrast, AgenticIR leverages specialized off-the-shelf models for each type of degradation. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to compare AgenticIR to the state-of-the-art models for each specific degradation task rather than to unified restoration models.\n  \n2. **Efficiency Concerns**: While the system is comprehensive, its workflow is notably complex and lengthy. Compared to regular image restoration models, how efficient is AgenticIR in processing images? This is a critical aspect for real-world applications of image restoration and should be addressed with precise comparative evaluations.\n\n3. **Toolbox Ablation Study**: Lines 159-160 state, \"For each degradation, we collect three to six advanced models to build the \u2018toolbox\u2019 that the intelligent agent can use.\" There is no ablation study analyzing the impact of selecting these advanced models on the system\u2019s effectiveness. Understanding the influence of each selected model in the toolbox could provide valuable insights.\n\n4. **GPT-4 Usage and Reproducibility**: AgenticIR uses GPT-4, but GPT-4 lacks a fixed version, which raises concerns about the reproducibility of experimental results. Additionally, there is no ablation study on the effects of using alternative LLMs, particularly open-source options, on performance outcomes."
