    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing demand for privacy-preserving techniques in numerous machine learning algorithms, elevating it to a critical concern. One promising solution involves the application of homomorphic encryption (HE). This study focuses on obtaining statistics based on the ranks of HE-encrypted data as a vital tool for robust data analysis. However, computing ranks in HE comes with significant computational costs due to the necessity of comparison operations, and there is currently no efficient method available.\nTo address this gap, we propose an approximate rank method that exploits pairwise comparisons of data to derive ranks for encrypted information. This method effectively measures the association between two-dimensional ranks. Specifically, by utilizing approximate ranks of two variables, we estimate Spearman rank correlation without relying on perfect sorting and introduce a technique to reduce the number of required comparisons.\nNumerical experiments have been conducted to validate our approach, demonstrating that the disparity in values between rank correlation and approximate rank correlation is not substantial. Notably, the processing of one block comprising 32,768 ciphertexts took approximately one minute, exhibiting observed linear complexity dependent on the number of blocks.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a method to improve computational efficiency in rank analysis of encrypted data. Traditional methods for calculating ranks on homomorphically encrypted (HE) data are significantly time-consuming, especially for computing Spearman rank correlation. This study introduces a novel \"group rank\" approach, which approximates ranks by focusing on comparisons at specifically selected points, thereby reducing the number of comparisons and computational cost.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through simulations and real data analysis, examining various data distributions and numbers of comparison points. Experiments using the SNUH dataset successfully estimated correlations among variables in actual test data, demonstrating the practical applicability of this approach."
