    "title": "Edge-aware Image Smoothing with Relative Wavelet Domain Representation",
    "abstract": "Image smoothing is a fundamental technique in image processing, designed to eliminate perturbations and textures while preserving dominant structures. It plays a pivotal role in numerous high-level computer vision tasks. More recently, both traditional and deep learning-based smoothing methods have been developed. However, existing algorithms frequently encounter issues such as gradient reversals and halo artifacts. Furthermore, the smoothing strength of deep learning-based models, once trained, cannot be adjusted for adapting different complexity levels of textures.  These limitations stem from the inability of previous approaches to achieve an optimal balance between smoothing intensity and edge preservation. Consequently, image smoothing while maintaining edge integrity remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a novel edge-aware smoothing model that leverages a relative wavelet domain representation. Specifically, by employing wavelet transformation, we introduce a new measure, termed Relative Wavelet Domain Representation (RWDR), which effectively distinguishes between textures and structures. Additionally, we present an innovative edge-aware scale map that is incorporated into the adaptive bilateral filter, facilitating mutual guidance in the smoothing process. This paper provides complete theoretical derivations for solving the proposed non-convex optimization model. Extensive experiments substantiate that our method has a competitive superiority with previous algorithms in edge-preserving and artifact removal. Visual and numerical comparisons further validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in several applications of image smoothing.",

                "value": "The main contribution of this work is the introduction of RWDR that effectively distinguishes textures from primary structures and preserves weaker edges. Additionally, the paper proposes an innovative edge-aware scale map method that dynamically adjusts scale based on the image structure, resulting in clearer distinctions between structure and texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides superior edge-preserving smoothing compared to existing methods."

The authors should consider comparing performance on downstream tasks with objective metrics. A user study could also statistically confirm the advantages of the proposed method.\n\n2. As a new method, it likely performs well in certain scenarios. However, I am more interested in its robustness and stability. In other words, can the authors provide a lower bound for the algorithm's performance? In which scenarios might it fail? Additionally, how sensitive is the algorithm to parameter changes?"

                "value": "1. Though the authors support their claims by extensive qualitative results, but they should also provide the quantitative results to validate their points in the main paper or at least in the supplementary. For instance, the authors can include PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), or MSE (Mean Squared Error) on standard synthetic benchmark datasets and LPIPS, MUSIQ, NIQE, MANIQA for real-world tasks. This would allow for a more objective comparison with existing method.\n2. The method section needs to be refined, as mentioned in Fig1 (that the detail enhancement image is boosted by four detail layers), this statement is not explained in the method section, how the four detail layers are being generated , is it from the wavelet decomposition?\n3. The paper has lacks ablation study. The authors have given mathematical proofs of choosing the particular operations like RWDR and the edge-aware scale map, they should also try to prove the effectiveness of each proposed component  on the overall model.\n4. The authors should also try to report the results on some real-world applications in Super-Resolution (RealSR, DrealSR,RealLR200), denoising (SIDD, DND) that would further prove the use of the proposed model, if the time permits and should also check on synthetic SR datasets like Manga109, Urban100, and BSD68 (for denoising)."
