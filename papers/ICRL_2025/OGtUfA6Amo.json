    "title": "Hi-Patch: Hierarchical Patch GNN for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Modeling",
    "abstract": "Multi-scale information is crucial for multivariate time series modeling. However, most existing time series multi-scale analysis methods treat all variables in the same manner, which is not well adaptive for Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS), where different variables have distinct original scales/sampling rates. Therefore, extracting temporal and inter-variable dependencies at multiple scales in IMTS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we propose a hierarchical patch graph network Hi-Patch. The key components of Hi-Patch are an intra-patch graph layer and several inter-patch graph layers. The intra-patch graph layer flexibly represents and fully captures both the local temporal and inter-variable dependencies of densely sampled variables at the original scales by employing intra-patch fully connected graph networks. Subsequently, several inter-patch graph layers are stacked to form a hierarchical architecture, progressively\nrepresenting and extracting more global temporal and inter-variable features of both sparsely and densely sampled variables through scale-specific graph networks. The output of the last inter-patch graph layer is fed into taskspecific decoders to adapt to different downstream tasks. Experimental results on 8 datasets show that Hi-Patch outperforms a range of state-of-the-art models in both IMTS forecasting and classification tasks.

The proposed method leverages both intra-patch and inter-patch graph layers to capture local and global temporal and inter-variable dependencies at multiple scales. The hierarchical architecture allows for a bottom-up extraction of features, from fine-grained to coarse-grained, adapting to the distinct scales and sampling rates of different variables in IMTS. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Hi-Patch through extensive experiments on eight datasets, showing superior performance over various state-of-the-art models in both forecasting and classification tasks for IMTS."

Such results fail to reflect the model's ability to learn more temporal dependencies from longer-term data. It would be better to illustrate this using a line chart. The experiment should be modified by fixing either the input or prediction length and then varying the other.
