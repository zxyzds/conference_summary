    "title": "Limitations of measure-first protocols in quantum machine learning",
    "abstract": "In recent times, there have been major developments in two distinct yet connected domains of quantum information. On the one hand, substantial progress has been made in so-called randomized measurement protocols. Here, a number of properties of unknown quantum states can be deduced from surprisingly few measurement outcomes, using schemes such as classical shadows. On the other hand, significant progress has been made in quantum machine learning. For example, exponential advantages have been proven when the data consists of quantum states and quantum algorithms can coherently measure multiple copies of input states. In this work, we aim to understand the implications and limitations of combining randomized measurement protocols with quantum machine learning, although the implications are broader. Specifically, we investigate quantum machine learning algorithms that, when dealing with quantum data, can either process it entirely using quantum methods or measure the input data through a fixed measurement scheme and utilize the resulting classical information. We prove limitations for quantum machine learning algorithms that use fixed measurement schemes on the input quantum states.\nOur results have several implications. From the perspective of randomized measurement procedures, we show limitations of measure-first protocols in the average case, improving on the state-of-the-art which only focuses on worst-case scenarios. Additionally, previous lower bounds were only known for physically unrealizable states. We improve upon this by employing quantum pseudorandom functions to prove that a learning separation also exists when dealing with physically realizable states, which may be encountered in experiments. From a machine learning perspective, our results are crucial for defining a physically meaningful task that shows fully quantum machine learning processing is not only more efficient but also necessary for solving certain problems. The tasks at hand are also realistic, as the algorithms and proven separations hold when working with efficiently preparable states and remain robust in the presence of measurement and preparation errors.",

                "value": "The authors design a quantum machine learning task that exhibits a sample and time complexity separation between two classes of quantum algorithms acting on input training data consisting of quantum data and classical labels with the goal of producing a classical description of a quantum circuit that can then be deployed on unseen quantum data to produce samples from a distribution related to the training data. The main difference between the two classes of quantum algorithms is that the more powerful class is allowed to process the input quantum-classical training data in \"one go\", while the weaker class is hamstrung to first turn the quantum data into classical data, one training data-point at a time, without looking at the classical labels before being allowed to process this now-classical data together with the classical labels through a quantum algorithm to produce a classical description of the deployment quantum circuit. At deployment time, the weaker class is then further forced to measure the unseen quantum data before feeding it into the quantum circuit produced at the end of the training phase.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there is a complexity separation between the fully quantum algorithm and the hamstrung quantum algorithm which seems to essentially be a restatement of the intractability of the Hidden Matching Communication problem. Finally, the authors claim to extend the complexity separation to efficiently preparable training data sets by using pseudo-random functions."

                "value": "Unfortunately, the high aims and strong potential of the \"Strengths\" section, seem not to be met. I believe this is mainly due to the overly restrictive setting of the weakened class of \"measurement-first\" quantum algorithms. The most confusing and vague constraint is: \"that the measurement strategy cannot depend on the specific target concept\". Looking at Definition 5 and 7 for clarity this seems to be the following constraint on the hamstrung class:\n\nTraining:\nQuantum data + classical labels -----[Point-wise measurement]------> M(Quantum data) + classical labels = Classical data + classical labels ----[Quantum Algorithm]----> Classical description of Quantum circuit\n\nDeployment:\nQuantum data -----[Point-wise measurement]------> M(Quantum data) = Classical data ----[Quantum Algorithm given by circuit above]----> Sample\n\nTherefore it seems that the main difference between the two classes is that the weaker one actually only operates on classical data during both training and deployment while the stronger one is allowed to operate on quantum data. This is a difference between data capacity and not really about a separation between interesting algorithmic classes.\n\nSecondly, there does seem to be quite a few unclear statements or mistakes:\n\n* Lines 157-159 is unclear\n* Lines 205-210 claims a significant difference between this work and Jerbi et al.'s, but given the above characterization it is not clear that this is the case.\n* Line 229 introduces f', why the prime?\n* \\pi_x is not anywhere clearly connected to \\Lamda_x\n* z and x are used inconsistently/confusingly in multiple places\n* Eq (3) and Eq (5): the training data should not include x, perhaps g_i(x) is somehow meant (however see below)?\n* Eq (3) and Eq (5): (y, b) ~ \\pi_x and not (x,y,b)\n* Line 285: perhaps \\Tilde{\\pi}_x should be \\Tilde{\\pi}_{T_x} since the x dependence is surely only through T_x\n* Eq (8): how can x appear as an unbound function variable on the LHS and as a bound variable on the RHS?\n* Line 370: the use of Aaronson et al. is the very heart of the whole paper, yet this is not reproduced anywhere in the paper\n* Line 434: please remind me what non-uniform means in this context.\n* Eq (9): the notation of dot and unfilled function brackets is not defined/explained.\n* Lines 475-480: is unclear, especially given that there are supposed to be different random functions for each data-point.\n* Eq (11): if g_i(x) is of size n+1, doesn't this change the learning problem in unclear-ways, not least because the dimensions no longer match (2n + 1 != 2n + 2)\n* Eq (29): \\pi_x(f) -> \\pi_x(f^{(k)})\n* Line 787: is query access -> has query access"

This is shown by constructing a specific learning problem based on the Hidden Matching problem and quantum pseudorandom states."

Could the authors comment on whether the community should consider most problems to be addressable using measurement-first protocols?
