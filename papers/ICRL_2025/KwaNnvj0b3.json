    "title": "Permutation-based Rank Test in the Presence of Discretization and Application in Causal Discovery with Mixed Data",
    "abstract": "Recent advances have shown that statistical tests for the rank of cross-covariance matrices play an important role in causal discovery. These rank tests include partial correlation tests as special cases and provide further graphical information about latent variables.\n   Existing rank tests typically assume that all the continuous variables can be perfectly measured,\n   and yet, in practice many variables can only be measured after discretization.\n   For example, in psychometric studies,\n    the continuous level of certain personality dimensions of a person can only be measured after being discretized into order-preserving options such as disagree, neutral, and agree.\n   Motivated by this, we\npropose Mixed data Permutation-based Rank Test (MPRT), which properly controls the statistical errors even when some or all variables are discretized.\nTheoretically, we establish the \nexchangeability and \nestimate the asymptotic null distribution by  permutations;\nas a consequence,\nMPRT can effectively control the Type I error in the presence of discretization while previous methods cannot. \nEmpirically, our method is validated by extensive experiments on synthetic data \nand real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness as well as applicability in causal discovery.",

The proposed method effectively extends rank testing to datasets with mixed continuous and discrete variables, a common scenario in practices. \n\n2. Extensive empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to maintain accurate Type I and Type II error rates, outperforming traditional methods. Additionally, the application to causal discovery with real-world personality data illustrates its practical value in inferring causal structures in realistic, mixed-type data scenarios.\n\n3. By using a permutation-based approach, MPRT avoids complex adjustments for non-continuous data distributions and offers a computationally feasible way to approximate the null distribution, making it suitable for large datasets with mixed data types."

They provide an asymptotic analysis of MPRT, demonstrating effective control of Type I error. The test accommodates scenarios with fully continuous, partially discretized, or fully discretized variables. Numerical experiments further confirm MPRT\u2019s control of Type I error and its effective performance on Type II error."

The authors have empirically verified the Type I and Type II errors. I\u2019m curious if the asymptotic behavior of the Type I error and power of the test could also be theoretically verified.
