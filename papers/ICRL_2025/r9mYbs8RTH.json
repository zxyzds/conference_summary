    "title": "Long-form Hallucination Detection with Self-elicitation",
    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in long-form question-answering tasks, they frequently present a hazard of producing factual inaccuracies or hallucinations. An effective strategy to mitigate this hazard is to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to detect hallucinations after the generation. The primary challenge resides in the comprehensive elicitation of the intrinsic knowledge acquired during their pre-training phase. However, existing methods that employ complex reasoning chains predominantly fall short of addressing this issue. Moreover, since existing methods for hallucination detection tend to decompose the text into isolated statements, they are unable to learn the inherent semantic continuity in long-form content. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, SelfElicit, which synergizes the self-elicitation of intrinsic knowledge of large language models and long-form continuity understanding. Specifically, we leverage self-generated thoughts derived from prior statements as catalysts to elicit the expression of intrinsic knowledge,\nwhich is integrated with knowledge hypergraphs to alleviate induced hallucinations and guide the factual evaluation by effectively organizing the elicited knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world medical QA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of self-elicitation and the superiority of our proposed method.",

The authors demonstrate through careful ablation studies that their approach outperforms variants without self-elicitation by 3.0% on average. The elicitation quality analysis (Figure 3) provides compelling evidence that self-generated thoughts lead to both higher factuality and diversity compared to alternative approaches.\n3. The authors show through their ablation studies that removing any of these components leads to performance degradation, with the full method outperforming ablated variants by 2.1-6.5% on average."

                "value": "Cons:\n1. There is no related work section. It is strongly suggested that the authors conduct a comprehensive literature review, especially on hallucination detection. Otherwise, this paper is actually not complete.\n2. \"For the convenience in writing, we slightly abuse the term \u201cnon-factual\u201d to represent both factuality and faithfulness hallucinations (Huang et al., 2023). Yet our work is not limited to either one\" is confusing. What type of hallucination does this paper focus on? It is suggested that the authors explicitly state the type of hallucinations rather than mix them.\n3. \"they are unable to learn the inherent semantic continuity in long-form content.\" (Line 19) is unclear. It is suggested that the authors define \"semantic continuity\" before they use it, even in the abstract.\n4. \"However, there remains a concern regarding their tendency to generate hallucinations (Bang et al., 2023), producing sentences with plausible looking yet factually1 unsupported content (Huang et al., 2023) and hurting their faithfulness in real-world scenarios expecting factually-accurate response (Wei et al., 2024).\" How do the authors define \"faithfulness\"? It is suggested that the authors differentiate \"faithfulness\" and \"factuality\". Otherwise, it is confusing.\n5. The example \u201cGliclazide can be taken at any time of the day\u2192, regardless of whether it is on an empty stomach or after meals\u2192\u201d needs more explanations why it is misleading.\n6. \"While insightful, we contend that these methods either require complex manual prompts or involve intricate reasoning processes, which limit their elicitation capacity and increase the risk of accumulated inaccuracies and hallucinations.\" (Line 67) needs more explanations\n7. The evaluated LLMs are relatively limited and small-scale. It is suggested that the authors also evaluate on SOTA models such as GPT-4 and models with a larger scale such as llama-70B. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the proposed method is relatively limited.\n8. The authors only evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on their own dataset. Could the authors also test the effectiveness on public datasets?\n9. The datasets are not open-sourced. The construction process of the dataset is also not clear.\n10. \"knowledge hypergraph\" (line 87) is unclear. It is suggested that the authors define \"knowledge hypergraph\" before they use it.\n11. The paper's evaluation is limited to the medical domain. The lack of evaluation across other domains makes it difficult to assess the general applicability of the approach.\n12. The conflict resolution mechanism, while important, relies heavily on Natural Language Inference (NLI). The paper doesn't provide detailed analysis of how different NLI approaches might impact the overall performance, nor does it discuss potential failure modes of the NLI component. This is a crucial component that deserves more thorough investigation."

It would also be beneficial to include a comparison with non-LLM based approaches and a cost-benefit analysis that weighs the improved performance against potential increased costs.\n\nPotential for Induced Hallucinations: While the framework aims to mitigate hallucinations, the process of self-elicitation and reflection may still introduce inaccuracies or hallucinations, especially with ambiguous or unfamiliar content.

The lack of experimentation in diverse domains means that the robustness and applicability of SelfElicit across different types of long-form content remain unproven.\n2. The theoretical underpinnings of the self-elicitation process and its interaction with the knowledge hypergraph are not thoroughly explored. The paper does not provide a deep dive into the mathematical or conceptual models that would support the claims about the framework's effectiveness.\n3. The paper heavily relies on quantitative metrics to evaluate the performance of the SelfElicit framework. However, there is an absence of qualitative analysis, such as case studies or detailed error analysis, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of the framework's strengths and weaknesses in practical scenarios.\n4. The visual representation in the paper, particularly in Figure 2, is not sufficiently clear or expressive, which can lead to confusion about the SelfElicit framework's methodology. The diagrams fail to effectively communicate the process, detracting from the reader's understanding and the overall quality of the presentation. A redesign of these figures is recommended for better clarity.\n5.

This limitation narrows the scope of general conclusions and reduces the credibility of SelfElicit\u2019s generalizability across diverse fields.\n\n3.

When handling statements categorized as \"Contradict\" the model still relies on its own judgment to identify conflicts and make corrections. Does this approach lead to cumulative errors? In other words, as the framework operates through its complete chain, it continuously encounters potential hallucinations. How do you view the cumulative error introduced by this process?\n\n3. In this workflow, the knowledge hypergraph provides a stable limitation on LLM hallucinations. However, during updates, the hypergraph itself might become contaminated with hallucinated information. Notably, in the w/o conflict setting, the performance decline is substantial. Since the article only briefly addresses this issue in line 257, I would like to understand further how this contamination is mitigated.\n\n4. In the proposed self-elicit method, is the core mechanism based more on the model's intrinsic knowledge expression or the knowledge hypergraph?\n\n5. In the Main Results section, the baseline was implemented locally rather than using data from other studies, which may weaken the persuasive power of the experimental results. Could you provide comparative data from similar scenarios in other literature to strengthen credibility? (For example, using results from SelfCheckGPT under comparable experimental conditions)."
