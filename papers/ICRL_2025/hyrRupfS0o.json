    "title": "Revisiting Quantum Algorithms for Linear Regressions: Quadratic Speedups without Data-Dependent Parameters",
    "abstract": "Linear regression is one of the most fundamental linear algebra problems. Given a dense matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and a vector $b$, the goal is to find $x'$ such that $\\|| Ax' - b \\||\\_2^2 \\leq (1+\\epsilon) \\min\\_{x} \\|| A x - b \\||\\_2^2$. The best classical algorithm takes $O(nd) + \\mathrm{poly}(d/\\epsilon)$ time [Clarkson and Woodruff STOC 2013, Nelson and Nguyen FOCS 2013]. On the other hand, quantum linear regression algorithms can achieve exponential quantum speedups, as shown in [Wang \\emph{Phys. Rev. A 96}, 012335, Kerenidis and Prakash ITCS 2017, Chakraborty, Gily{\\'e}n and Jeffery ICALP 2019]. However, the running times of these algorithms depend on some quantum linear algebra-related parameters, such as $\\kappa(A)$, the condition number of $A$. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm that runs in $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1}\\sqrt{n}d^{1.5}) + \\mathrm{poly}(d/\\epsilon)$ time and outputs a classical solution. It provides a quadratic quantum speedup in $n$ over the classical lower bound without any dependence on data-dependent parameters. In addition, we also show our result can be generalized to multiple regression and ridge linear regression.",

                "value": "This paper considers the problem of solving linear regression, multiple regression, and ridge linear regression using quantum algorithms. Previous quantum algorithms that leverage quantum linear algebra techniques have shown exponential speedups in the system size $n$, but they often depend on certain quantum linear algebra-related parameters, such as the condition number of the regression matrix. An open question is whether quantum speedups can be achieved without relying on data-dependent parameters. This paper answers this question in the affirmative by developing quantum algorithms for linear regression, multiple regression, and ridge regression with quadratic quantum speedups. Technically, the algorithms first generate a subspace embedding of the original regression matrix through sampling from its leverage score distribution, achievable in $O(\\sqrt{n})$ time if given a quantum row query oracle. The algorithms then solve the regression problems within this reduced subspace, where the solutions also have small regrets in the original problems."

Quantumly, algorithms with running time polylogarithmic in n are known but their running time depends on the condition number of the regression matrix and other extra parameters. The quantum algorithm in the current paper is the first one with a running time that is sublinear in n, polynomial in d and 1/\\epsilon where \\epsilon is the desired accuracy and no dependence on extra parameters. \n\nOn the technical level, the results are based on combining the recent quantum algorithm by Apers and Gribling for computing leverage scores with classical algorithms for linear regression."

In recent years, many quantum algorithms for linear regression problems have been proposed.

In this work, the authors addressed this issue by proposing a new quantum algorithm with time complexity $O(\\sqrt{n} d^{1.5}/\\varepsilon + \\text{poly}(d/\\varepsilon))$ for obtaining an $\\varepsilon$-approximate solution, which has no dependence on the condition number. The core technique to achieve this speedup is by using the quantum leverage score sampling procedure proposed in [AG23]."

It appears that the paper directly replaces the leverage score sampling procedure from [CW13] with its quantum counterpart to achieve results. Furthermore, the concept of using a quantized leverage score sampling procedure for solving linear regression problems has previously been introduced in [Sha23]. \nAlso, the result of the work seems a bit weak compared with the classical counterparts. For input an $n\\times d$ matrix, a classical algorithm in [CW13] can run in time $O(nd \\log (1/\\varepsilon)) + \\tilde{O} (d^3)$, which could have logarithmic dependence in the error parameter $\\varepsilon$, but the quantum algorithm has a polynomial dependence on $\\varepsilon$. For comparison, the quantum algorithm for linear programming proposed in [AG23] also achieves a speedup over their classical counterparts while keeping logarithmic dependence in the precision parameter $\\varepsilon$."
