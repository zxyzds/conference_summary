    "title": "Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Synthetic Data in LLM Post-Training: A Reverse-Bottleneck Perspective",
    "abstract": "Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process. We open source our code through an anonymous GitHub repository at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Understanding-Synthetic.",

                "value": "The paper introduces the framework of understanding the LLM synthetic data generation process, by incorporating the reverse-bottleneck perspective. Using a reverse-bottleneck perspective, the authors model the generation of synthetic data and propose an information-theoretic metric called Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) to assess the generalization performance of post-trained models. It also reports the information gain and generalization bound from previous literature."

Instead, it enumerates the equations of generalization errors and gains, but lacking sufficient experimental results to support this.\n\n3. Some derivations may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with advanced information theory, which may requires providing backgrounds about this. Since the authors did not conduct real-world experiments, it is unsure whether this can generalize to real-world settings. The framework assumes ideal conditions for synthetic data and LLMs, which may not generalize well to complex real-world scenarios with noisy data or biases."

The modeling of synthetic data, focusing on distributional aspects is elaborate and properly justified as well. It establishes an intuitive information-theoretic based upper bound on the generalization error for an under-aligned LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data, and also delineates how this upper bound compares to the one when the LLM is tuned on just the real world samples (anchor data) - showcasing how the former proves to be a more stringent upper bound, leading to better generalization capabilities. Definitely helps bridge a gaping gap in LLM research!"

The paper presents good theoretical foundations of \"why\" it is important to use synthetic data in post-training alignment and \"how\" it aids better generalization capabilities of the model. But it fails to address some really important \"hows\" that it promises in the Introduction section :\n   - How does this study help in developing tailored synthetic data generation - that more effectively address specific gaps in training data, thereby enhancing the overall performance and generalization capabilities of large language models\n   - How does this translate to better post-training practices involving synthetic datasets, from a practical perspective.\n2. The assumption that the transformation function \u03c6T is reversible (Section 3.2) is unclear for real LLM prompting scenarios, as task-to-prompt relationships are often many-to-many.A better delineation of this point would be helpful.\n3. \u2060The relationship between \"synthetic factors\" and actual LLM generation processes is not well defined.\n4. The connection between the theoretical \"information gain\" concept and practical improvements in LLM performance is not clearly established. \n5. I think its very crucial to address how the \"diversity\" and \"quality\" in synthetic data samples are a big part of why task generalization actually works when models are post trained on synthetic data. These should be adequately quantified and incorporated in the upper bound equations as well, for a more complete picture."

It would be illustrative to conduct the experiments documented in this paper on data of higher dimensions to reinforce that the theory holds for datasets of varying dimensionality.\n- Additionally, given that this analysis is aimed at studying the behaviour of LLMs, the theoretical proofs presented in this work would benefit from conducting the same experiments either with LLMs or other non-GMM models to corroborate the theoretical inferences."
