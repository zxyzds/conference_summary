    "abstract": "Diffusion bridge models effectively facilitate image-to-image (I2I) translation by connecting two distributions. However, existing methods overlook the impact of noise in sampling SDEs, transition kernel, and the base distribution on sampling efficiency, image quality and diversity. To address this gap, we propose the Stochasticity-controlled Diffusion Bridge (SDB), a novel theoretical framework that extends the design space of diffusion bridges, and provides strategies to mitigate singularities during both training and sampling. By controlling stochasticity in the sampling SDEs, our sampler achieves speeds up to $5 \\times$ faster than the baseline, while also producing lower FID scores. After training, SDB sets new benchmarks in image quality and sampling efficiency via managing stochasticity within the transition kernel. Furthermore, introducing stochasticity into the base distribution significantly improves image diversity, as quantified by a newly introduced metric.",

                "value": "This paper introduces Stochasticity-controlled Diffusion Bridge (SDB), a generalized diffusion bridge-based model framework that enables flexible control of stochasticity. Specifically, SDB considers stochasticity in 1) the transition kernel, 2) sampling SDE, and 3) the base distribution. This is achieved by designing a noise schedule for the transition kernel, regulating the drift term in the sampling SDEs, and adding noise into the base distribution. The paper also proposes a score reparameterization and a discretization sampling scheme to mitigate singularity. Experiments show that the proposed SDB has better image quality, efficiency, and diversity than other baselines in the image-to-image translation task."

Under the framework, this work highlights the importance of randomness in DBM. It shows that carefully selected randomness in sampling SDEs, transition kernel, and the base distribution can significantly improve sampling efficiency, image quality, and diversity.\n\n2. The proposed score reparameterization and discretization sampling scheme by design is more likely to avoid singularity and instability in training and sampling.\n\n3.

It is not shown how different choices of $\\gamma_{max}$ affect the results. In addition, there's no ablation study to show the effects of the proposed reparameterization and sampling algorithm. Thus, it is unclear how much gain each technique contributes to the final model.  \nRegarding the verification of reparameterization, apart from the normal metrics, I also suggest analyzing the numerical stability during training/sampling to show that the proposed technique indeed mitigates singularity.\n\n2. Qualitative comparison is insufficient. In the main paper, only Fig. 4 shows the qualitative comparison between SDB and DDBM. However, a comparison to other methods such as DBIM should also be provided. I also suggest including DBIM in Table 4 so that the SDB is compared to more than one baseline in terms of diversity.\n\n3. The randomness added to the base distribution lacks further explanation. Why convolving $\\pi_{cond}$ with a Gaussian rather than adding Gaussian noise to $\\pi_{cond}$? What's the kernel size for the Gaussian?\n\n4. DBIM is not discussed in related works.\n\nTypo: Line 212 ODE -> SDE."

Limited Discussion on Computational Overhead**  \nAlthough the model achieves lower FID scores with fewer function evaluations, the added complexity of SC mechanisms (especially in tuning multiple noise schedules) may increase computational overhead. A direct comparison of computational resources (e.g., time or memory) required by SDB versus other DBMs would provide a clearer picture of the trade-offs.\n\n**2. Lack of Detailed Analysis on the Contribution of Each Stochasticity Control Component**  \nWhile the authors claim that SC enhances image quality, sampling efficiency, and conditional diversity, there is a lack of detailed analysis on how each component (e.g., SC in the transition kernel, SC in the base distribution) individually contributes to these improvements. Although overall performance gains are evident, the authors have divided Stochasticity Control into three distinct components, yet the extent to which each component contributes to the model's improvement is not adequately demonstrated through ablation studies.\n\n**3. Lack of Clear Design Guidelines for Stochasticity Control**  \nThe paper introduces various strategies for enhancing performance through Stochasticity Control (SC). However, it lacks clear principles for determining optimal parameters in SC design. For instance, the design of the \u03f5t value used in SC is largely determined empirically, which complicates the systematic selection of SC parameters suitable for specific tasks. Additionally, the proposed method includes several hyperparameters (e.g.,  \u03b1t, \u03b2t, \u03b3t, \u03f5t), yet there is no concrete guideline on how these should be chosen. While certain values were empirically set during experiments, it remains unclear how these can be applied in more general cases. To address this, it would be helpful if the authors could provide a sensitivity analysis for these key hyperparameters, showing how performance varies across different settings. Additionally, we suggest the authors share any rules of thumb or heuristics they relied on when selecting these parameters, which would provide practical guidance for applying the method in various contexts.\n\n**4. Lack of Reliability for the Proposed Evaluation Metric**  \nThe authors propose Average Feature Distance (AFD) as a metric for assessing diversity. However, there is insufficient analysis to establish the reliability and validity of this metric. To substantiate AFD as a credible measure of diversity, the authors should have demonstrated its application across multiple existing baselines and metrics, thereby enhancing its reliability. In particular, there is a lack of comparative analysis and explanation on how AFD interacts with other evaluation metrics and effectively represents trustworthy conditional diversity. To establish the reliability of AFD, it would be beneficial for the authors to compare AFD scores with human judgments of diversity or apply AFD to datasets with known diversity characteristics. Additionally, case studies illustrating how AFD addresses insights that are missed by similar existing metrics would strengthen its credibility as a measure of diversity."

While the mathematical descriptions provide a theoretical foundation, the paper would benefit from a figure or diagram that illustrates how Stochasticity Control interacts with other components of the model. Including a main figure to depict the overall framework and interconnections within the proposed model would greatly enhance readers' understanding of the core concepts.\n\n**2. Purpose of Figure 1**  \nFigure 1 aims to provide an intuitive illustration of how the transition kernels in image-to-image (I2I) translation can incorporate noise through the configuration of multiple hyperparameters, as proposed by the authors. However, since the ultimate goal of I2I translation is to transform the source image into the target image, evaluating only the final translated result may suffice. Figure 1 merely demonstrates the progressive addition of noise, making it challenging to discern the specific impact of these parameters. A clearer explanation of the intended purpose of Figure 1 would be beneficial.\n\nI would be willing to consider increasing the rate if clear responses are provided to the points raised in the Weakness and Question sections."
