    "title": "Noise-Robust Preference Losses for Deep Regression Models",
    "abstract": "Deep regression models are widely employed for tasks such as pricing and forecasting. In industrial applications, it is common for analysts to adjust model outputs before they are deployed in commercial products. These adjustments, which we name \"analyst influences\", not only ensure the quality of the final products but also provide training data to improve model performance over time. However, due to the huge volumes of data, analyst influences can be applied broadly and can lack precision, hindering training effectiveness. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel framework Preference Learning from Analyst Influence which creates a weighted loss function that explicitly accounts for the relative quality levels of the training samples in comparison to model outputs. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of coarse training instances. Our extensive experiments on real-world data drawn from airline revenue management demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances pricing stability but also improves alignment with analyst influences compared to baselines.",

                "value": "The authors propose a novel method called Preference Learning from Analyst Influence (PLAI), which introduces a weighted loss function that accounts for the relative quality levels of training samples compared to model outputs. The paper includes a detailed theoretical analysis, the formal definition of relative quality, and the proposal of three PLAI loss implementations: Sigmoid PLAI loss, Focal PLAI loss, and Clip PLAI loss. The experiments validate the effectiveness of PLAI in improving model performance and alignment with analyst preferences."

This would provide a more comprehensive. understanding of PLAI's performance relative to the current research landscape.\n2.\tThe background research for the article was insufficient and it is suggested that the literature review section should be expanded to cover more existing work relevant to the research topic. This includes recent research developments, classic papers, and high-quality work that is widely recognized in the field.\n3.\tThe link to the experiment is not given, are the results is not verifiable."

In Equation(1), the author assumes that analyst influence on price follows a Gaussian distribution. Please give some justification for this assumption.\n\n3.
