    "title": "ONLINE EPSILON NET & PIERCING SET FOR GEOMETRIC CONCEPTS",
    "abstract": "VC-dimension (Vapnik & Chervonenkis (1971)) and $\\varepsilon$-nets  (Haussler & Welzl (1987)) are key concepts in Statistical Learning Theory. Intuitively, VC-dimension is a measure of the size of a class of sets. The famous $\\varepsilon$-net theorem, a fundamental result in Discrete Geometry, asserts that if the VC-dimension of a set system is bounded, then a small sample exists that intersects all sufficiently large sets.\n    \n    In online learning scenarios where data arrives sequentially, the VC-dimension helps bound the complexity of the set system, and $\\varepsilon$-nets ensure the selection of a small representative set. This sampling framework is crucial in various domains, including spatial data analysis, motion planning in dynamic environments, optimization of sensor networks, and feature extraction in computer vision, among others. Motivated by these applications, we study the online $\\varepsilon$-net problem for geometric concepts with bounded VC-dimension. While the offline version of this problem has been extensively studied, surprisingly, there are no known theoretical results for the online version to date. We present the first deterministic online algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio for intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$. Next, we give a randomized online algorithm with a near-optimal competitive ratio for axis-aligned boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\\le 3$. Furthermore, we introduce a novel technique to analyze similar-sized objects of constant description complexity in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which may be of independent interest. \n    \n    Next, we focus on the continuous version of this problem (called online piercing set), where ranges of the set system are geometric concepts in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ arriving in an online manner, but the universe is the entire ambient space, and the objective is to choose a small sample that intersects all the ranges. Although online piercing set is a very well-studied problem in the literature, to our surprise, very few works have addressed generic geometric concepts without any assumption about the sizes. We advance this field by proposing asymptotically optimal competitive deterministic algorithms for boxes and ellipsoids in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for any $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$.",

It appears that very less work is done regarding construction of epsilon nets/piercing nets when the objects appear in an online manner.

Here I give few specific examples:\n\ni) In the Notation and Preliminaries section there is hardly any difference in the definition of online epsilon net and online piercing set. \n\nii) Terms like ranges, range space are used in the introduction section without properly defining them.\n\niii) You can give simple examples for what can be $\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal {R}$ etc. in the introduction itself. The final results can be abstract but at least some examples might help understand the terminology better.\n\niv) It would be better to bring the pseudo code of the algorithms in the main paper\n\nThe writing and presentation need to be improved a lot.  In the current state the paper will not be accessible to a broad audience.\n\n2) It is not clear from the paper what are the technical challenges faced to maintain an epsilon net in the online setting. Please clarify as it will help highlight the novelty as to why the techniques of constructing the epsilon net differ from the offline case. For this you can add a small paragraph has to how epsilon nets can be constructed for similar object in the offline setting and why it is difficult to modify such algorithms for the online setting."

All results depend solely on the Euclidean dimension, making the discussion of VC-dimension somewhat distracting for the reader. I recommend either removing this discusstion entirely or clearly articulating the relationship between the results and VC-dimension.\n\n2. The connection between the paper's results and existing literature is not sufficiently clarified.\n\n2.1. The authors claim that their results are asymptotically optimal. Could you specify which variable you are considering for the asymptotic limit?\n\n2.2. The authors reference several existing lower bounds, some expressed in the forms $\\log(n)$ and $\\log(m)$. These bounds do not appear directly comparable to the results presented in this paper. Please elaborate on the relationships, similarities, and differences between these bounds and yours.\n\n2.3. In line 132, the authors introduce a bound of the form $\\log(M)$ without defining $M$, immediately following the introduction of the variable $m$. This lack of definition creates confusion, particularly regarding the similarity between uppercase $M$ and lowercase $m$. I suggest defining $M$ and potentially selecting a different variable to avoid this ambiguity.\n\n3. Several terms and concepts lack formal definitions:\n\n3.1. I recommend that the authors formally define $\\epsilon$-nets in Section 2.\n\n3.2. What is the definition of the hitting set problem? The authors frequently mention it and compare it to the piercing set problem without providing a clear definition. Since the paper does not focus on the hitting set problem, I suggest removing this discussion to maintain focus and coherence.\n\n3.3. In line 42, the definition of a range space is missing.\n\n3.4. The dual range space is introduced in line 75, but its definition is not provided until the following page.\n\n3.5. The parameter $\\alpha$ related to an object is not defined until later in the text (line 93).\n\n3.6. In line 130 (and many other places ao, line 130 is just an example), the authors use the variables $P$ and $X$ interchangeably without defining $P$."

This can restrict practical use in real-world, high-dimensional datasets.\n2. The results are mainly for regular, axis-aligned geometric objects (boxes, ellipsoids), yet real-world applications often involve irregular or rotated shapes. Without additional adaptability, the proposed algorithms would struggle in cases where piercing sets are needed for non-standard objects.\n3. In the randomized approach for axis-aligned rectangles, a binary search tree is constructed over a subset of points, dividing intervals repeatedly until only \u03b5-heavy regions remain. While theoretically sound, constructing and updating such a binary tree might be impractical in real-time applications due to overhead. A practical complexity analysis or alternative for dynamic binary tree maintenance would make the algorithm more viable.\n4. The paper is heavily theoretical, with limited discussion of empirical validation. Experiments comparing the proposed algorithms' performance to existing methods would strengthen the practical implications.\n5. Overall, I think this is a good paper, but might not be quite suitable for ICLR. Maybe the computational geometry or theory conferences, like SoCG, are more appropriate."

The paper does not provide a sensitivity analysis on the effect of different random sample sizes P in Section 3.2, which could significantly affect performance. Without such an analysis, it\u2019s unclear whether the algorithm can reliably achieve near-optimal competitive ratios across different datasets and problem scales. How robust is the algorithm for online \u03b5-nets under varying sample sizes?"
