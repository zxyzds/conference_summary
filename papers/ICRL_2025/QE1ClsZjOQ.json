    "title": "Dual-Forecaster: A Multimodal Time Series Model Integrating Descriptive and Predictive Texts",
    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a vital role for decision-making across a wide range of real-world domains, which has been extensively studied. Most existing single-modal models rely solely on numerical series, which suffer from the limitations imposed by insufficient information. Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability. We begin by developing the historical text-time series contrastive loss to align the descriptively historical textual data and corresponding time series data, followed by encoding multimodal text-time series representations between them through the history-oriented modality interaction module, and then combining predictive textual data through the future-oriented modality interaction module to ensure textual insights-following forecasting. Our comprehensive evaluations on synthetic dataset and captioned-public datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.",

However, the practicality of the task definition could be better justified, specifically regarding the availability of caption data in real-world applications.\n\n- There may be potential information leakage in this setting/dataset used. According to the TGTSF [1] cited in related work, to avoid directly using the information in the future time series, it is advisable to use the text information from external sources that is related to the system we are analyzing. \n\n- The captioning process of public dataset needs further discussion. Directly asking the GPT to describe the time series may not be a promising method. \n    - The GPT's ability of processing numerical values still remains under discussion. Asking it to generate description of time series which is also a sequence of float values, may suffer from severe hallucination problem. \n    - As mentioned above, since the textual descriptions are derived directly from the time series data, there is a risk of information leakage, particularly if these descriptions are used for future predictions.\n    - It seems that the captioned textual information also contains numerical values. It is still questionable that if the information in these values still remains after the text embedding model, i.e. RoBERTa in this paper. \n\n- According to the ablation study, this work seems to fall into the category of aligning time series pattern and textual description. Maybe it is a better idea to apply this to classification and anomaly detection task, which is not very sensitive to the information leakage problem. \n\n[1] Zhijian Xu, Yuxuan Bian, Jianyuan Zhong, Xiangyu Wen, and Qiang Xu.

It employs three cross-modality alignment techniques\u2014contrastive loss, history-oriented, and future-oriented modality interaction modules\u2014to align and integrate information across these modalities. Experimental results on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster outperforms baseline models by leveraging multimodal comprehension, thus underscoring the value of textual insights in time series forecasting.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Missing Baseline Comparison**: The authors reference the paper \"Beyond Trend and Periodicity: Guiding Time Series Forecasting with Textual Cues\" by Xu et al. (2024), yet they do not conduct a comparison experiment with this approach. Given the conceptual similarity between the two models, it is crucial to include this as a baseline to demonstrate any distinct advantages of the proposed method.\n- **Over-reliance on Synthetic Data and Limited Real-world Testing**: While the paper includes evaluations on both synthetic and public datasets, the reliance on synthetic data limits the applicability of the results. Synthetic setups with artificial textual descriptions do not reflect the complexities and nuances of real-world time series data. The public datasets used (e.g., ETTm1, ETTm2) are also limited in variety and complexity. To strengthen the paper, the authors should include more challenging datasets, such as exchange rates or stock indices, which better represent real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper lacks evaluation on how the model handles noisy or misleading textual data\u2014an issue highly relevant in real-world, high-stakes contexts.\n- **Limited Justification for Dual Textual Modality** The inclusion of both historical (descriptive) and future (predictive) textual information is presented as a core feature, yet the paper provides limited justification for this design choice. It is unclear whether this dual modality substantially enhances forecasting or if similar results could be achieved using only one type of text. A direct ablation study comparing the use of single versus dual text modalities would help clarify this.\n- **Error Bounds Missing** The paper does not report error bounds or standard deviations for the results across multiple runs. This omission makes it difficult to assess the consistency and robustness of the reported performance improvements. Including error bounds would provide a more rigorous evaluation of the model's stability."

                "value": "- Have you considered simply combining the historical and future texts into a single input rather than using separate modules to handle them? This approach could reduce model complexity. How do you anticipate that combining the texts would affect forecasting performance, and is there evidence that using separate modules significantly enhances results?\n- How would your captioning method perform on more complex and volatile datasets, such as exchange rates or stock indices, where trends and patterns are less predictable? Given that these types of data often contain abrupt changes and noise, would your approach to generating textual descriptions still produce reliable or meaningful captions?\n- Real-world applications, especially in high-stakes domains like finance, often include noisy or misleading textual data. How does your model handle such cases where the text may not accurately reflect trends in the time series? Have you tested the robustness of Dual-Forecaster with noisy or contradictory textual inputs, and if not, could you discuss any mechanisms that could be added to mitigate potential misdirection from unreliable text?"
