    "title": "STDM: Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models for Time Series Analysis",
    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models have emerged as a formidable method, consistently surpassing previous state-of-the-art benchmarks. However, a notable challenge in time series-related tasks like anomaly detection and forecasting is the conditioning for models to reconstruct inputs accurately or generate samples based on past time steps rather than producing entirely new samples. To address this, we introduce a novel technique that enhances the sampling capabilities of denoising diffusion models for time series analysis, namely Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (STDM). While recent methods fall short of mapping contextual neighborhood dependencies directly into the sampling of a noisy sample, we focus on guiding the forward process of the diffusion model. The degeneration of a sample is based on the idea that values of neighboring time steps are highly correlated. We benefit from this assumption by presenting a diffusion step-dependent convolutional kernel to capture spatial relations and a combined, correlated noise to degenerate the input. Our method can be integrated seamlessly into various existing time series diffusion models. We compare the results of anomaly detection and forecasting when using the traditional and our novel forward process. In our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that an adaption of the forward process can be beneficial, as our approach outperforms diffusion models with the ordinary forward process in task-specific metrics, underscoring the efficacy of our strategy in enhancing time series analysis through advanced diffusion techniques.",

I do not understand the motivation and significance of paying attention to the temporal patterns in the diffusion forward process of adding noise. It appears that the temporal correlations introduced by the noise in the forward process may enable the model to effectively consider and learn these correlations for denoising in the reverse process. However, the writing of the paper does not clearly explain this.\n- In Section 3, the author mentioned that \"our methodology innovatively manipulates the forward process. This adjustment facilitates faster convergence during training and enhances robustness during inference\". Nevertheless, the mechanism by which STDM accelerates training and improves inference robustness are not sufficiently explained, and both theoretical analysis and lacks empirical evidence to support this assertion.\n- The experiment results only evaluate the DiffusionAE and TimeGrad models, which are not enough to support the effectivenenss of the proposed method. And there is a notable absence of baselines for time series forecasting and anomaly detection, which limits the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.\n- The writing and charts are extremely crude and rudimentary."

In my opinion, kernel $H$ seems to be able to capture only **temporal** pattern correlations within a series, but the author claims that STDM captures **spatial** correlations (for example, the contribution section). The method cannot capture spatio-temporal correlations of multivariate series anyway, I don't understand why the author named it **Spatio-Temporal** diffusion model."

However, this smoothing approach doesn\u2019t appear particularly meaningful, as in diffusion models we generally don\u2019t focus much on the intermediate states in the noise/denoising process but rather only on the final generated samples. Additionally, the experiments are weak, as the paper only compares against the original DDPM and overlooks recent work from the past few years."

If I understand correctly, $x_0$ should be $x_{k-1}$.\n    \n3. Eq(14). As $k \\to \\infty$, will this distribution converge to $N(0, I)$? This is relevant because in the experiments, you directly sample $x_K \\sim N(0, I)$.\n    \n4. The experiments are too simplistic.
