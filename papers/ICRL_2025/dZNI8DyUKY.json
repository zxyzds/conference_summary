Advantages of MAE Framework: The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the specific advantages of using the MAE framework for adversarial purification. Clarifying this would enhance the reader's understanding of its effectiveness.\n\n3. Confusion Regarding Table IV Results: The results presented in Table IV are confusing. A clearer relationship should be established between these results and the design of the training loss function to aid comprehension.\n\n4. Presentation of Accuracy Metrics: It is recommended to show both clean and robust accuracy simultaneously using a scatter diagram, which would provide a clearer visual representation of the performance trade-offs.\n\n5. Inconsistencies in DiffPure Results: In Table 6, only the results of DiffPure are reported with standard deviation. It would be beneficial to clarify why other methods are not included. Additionally, based on the reported accuracies, DiffPure seems to outperform MAEP in some settings, yet this is not adequately discussed.\n\n6. Limited Comparison Between MAEP Variants: The differences between MAEP and MAEP with LoRA are minimal, particularly noted in Table 7. A more thorough analysis of their comparative advantages would be useful.\n\n7. Source Consistency for DiffPure Results: The results for DiffPure across different tables appear inconsistent, with some data excerpted from previous works while others are reproduced. Ensuring results come from a uniform source would facilitate a more standardized comparison.\n\n8. Additional Testing Settings: The paper should report the results of DiffPure in Table 8 under the setting of training on CIFAR10 and testing on ImageNet to provide a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n9. Running Time Analysis: While MAEP performs better than some baselines like DiffPure, it is less efficient than DISCO. A deeper discussion of running time implications in practical applications would be beneficial."

All experiments in this paper are based on evaluations from nearly two years ago, leading to an overestimation of robustness for diffusion-based methods by more than 20%. Additionally, to properly assess the robustness of defenses, accurate gradient-based attack methods should be used; otherwise, the evaluations risk suffering from obfuscated gradients, as highlighted by Athalye et al. [4]. The high adversarial robustness values around 90% shown in Tables 2 and 5 appear overly optimistic.\n\n   - **References**:\n      - [1] Lee, Minjong, and Dongwoo Kim. \"Robust evaluation of diffusion-based adversarial purification.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.09051* (2023).\n      - [2] Kang, Mintong, Dawn Song, and Bo Li. \"DiffAttack: Evasion Attacks Against Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36* (2023).\n      - [3] Chen, Huanran, et al. \"Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model.\" *ICML* (2024).\n      - [4] Athalye, A., Carlini, N., Wagner, D. \"Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security: Circumventing defenses to adversarial examples.\" *International Conference on Machine Learning*, PMLR, 2018.\n\n2. **Misleading Claims on Diffusion Model Efficiency**: The paper claims that \u201cIn contrast to most prior studies that rely on the diffusion model for test-time defense to remarkably increase the inference time,\u201d suggesting that diffusion-based methods are inherently slow.

After a simple search with the keywords \u201cmasked autoencoder adversarial purification\u201d I found many similar papers [1,2,3], indicating that the idea of MAE-based purification was not first introduced in this paper. However, these papers are not discussed in the original manuscript, so I suggest that the author should conduct a more thorough investigation of this field.\n\n2. The experimental results shown in the manuscript far exceed the current SOTA results, therefore I am concerned that some settings in the paper differ from standard settings.  \na) Under the setting of using WRN-28-10 as a classifier on CIFAR-10 to defend against AutoAttack, the original DiffPure paper reports a robust accuracy of only 70.64%, while the current manuscript claims a robust accuracy as high as 87.29%.  \nb) Moreover, I notice that the results for most methods on PGD and AutoAttack (AA) are very close, as shown in Table 6. The average accuracy difference between defending against these two attacks for all methods is less than 1.5%, which is completely different from the results reported in [4,5]. In the l-inf norm threats, the robust accuracy difference between defending against PGD and AA is nearly 15%.  \nc) Due to the presence of the random factor, it would consider using PGD+EOT and AA (rand) for evaluation, instead of the PGD and AA (standard) used in the manuscript.  \nd) Removing perturbations by merely missing pixels will lead to low robust accuracy against unseen threats, which is mentioned by [6], and further discussed by [2]. To more effectively AP, [2] introduced Gaussian noise to ensure that the perturbation on each pixel is destroyed. However, MAEP maintains a high level of robust accuracy against unseen threats without the introduction of Gaussian noise, which is a bit unexpected.  \ne) Questions: How to generate the adversarial examples in the evaluation? What is the target of the attacks \u2014is it the classifier model or the purifier model?\n\n3. I notice that the MAEP model trained on CIFAR-10 is directly and efficiently applied to ImageNet and achieves performance exceeding that of the pre-trained diffusion model. I am curious about how this is achieved, specifically how a model trained on low-resolution images is applied to high-resolution images. One obvious question is how the two types of input images with different sizes are handled. Is image downsampling and upsampling used? Also, what is the specific pipeline for this process?\n\n[1] Adversarial Purification of Information Masking. 2023.  \n[2] Denoising Masked AutoEncoders Help Robust Classification. 2023.  \n[3] MAEDefense: An Effective Masked AutoEncoder Defense against Adversarial Attacks. 2023.  \n[4] Robust Evaluation of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification. 2023.  \n[5] Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model. 2024.  \n[6] Trust-no-pixel: A remarkably simple defense against adversarial attacks based on massive inpainting. 2022."
