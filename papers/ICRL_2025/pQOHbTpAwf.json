    "title": "DeepNT: Path-Centric Graph Neural Networks for Network Tomography",
    "abstract": "Network tomography is a crucial problem in network monitoring, where observable path measurements are used to infer unmeasured network properties, making it essential for tasks such as route selection, fault diagnosis, and traffic control. However, most existing methods assume that the network topology is fully known\u2014an assumption that rarely holds in practice. The incomplete topology introduces significant challenges in extracting path information for predicting path performance. Furthermore, these approaches are typically designed for a single path performance metric and lack the flexibility to handle multiple metrics that may be of interest in a single network. To address these limitations, we propose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a new framework that simultaneously infers the adjacency matrix and predicts unmeasured paths by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbones to learn path-centric end-node pair representations under incomplete network topology. To ensure that the learned adjacency matrix aligns with the characteristics of real-world networks, we propose a novel learning objective that constrains the model in terms of connectivity, sparsity, and path performance bounds, enabling robust generalization across a variety of performance metrics. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph topology compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

                "value": "This paper presents a neural approach for network tomography called DeepNT. The proposed approach jointly learns the network topology and the GNN for predicting path metrics using alternating optimization. In particular, the path metrics are predicted based on a path aggregation layer that is trained to predict pairwise metrics based on observations. Moreover, triangle inequality is incorporated into the loss to enforce the best path to be selected (according to some objective metric). The graph is learned as an adjacency matrix with an L1 penalty and a connectivity constraint based on its second eigenvalue. The authors propose an alternating optimization scheme (GNN and graph learning) that uses projection to minimize L1 and guarantee a valid matrix. Ten datasets and six baselines are considered in the experiments. The results show that DeepNT consistently outperforms the baselines."

It is not clear that the proposed path aggregation is significantly better than typical GNN aggregation or the subgraph aggregation using by link prediction methods such as SEAL. Moreover, there are many graph learning approaches, including bilevel optimization, that are not compared against the one proposed in the paper.\n\n3) Supporting evidence for proposed solution: while the results presented are promising, it would be important to provide some theoretical support or at least better intuition on why NeuroNT is a good solution. For instance, are there any guarantees that the predicted pairwise metrics are near optimal given enough observations? This would definitely strengthen the paper."

While DeepNT demonstrates favorable scalability in empirical evaluations, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of its computational complexity, particularly regarding training on large-scale graphs. A formal complexity analysis for different network sizes, embedding types, and constraint applications would clarify computational trade-offs, especially since training with large adjacency matrices and triangle inequality constraints may become a bottleneck."

                "value": "1. The DeepNT model introduces a path-centric GNN, providing a new theoretical framework for network tomography. Unlike traditional GNNs that focus on nodes or entire graphs, the path-centric GNN concentrates on learning the dynamic performance of networks through the aggregation of information from sequences of nodes. This method allows the model to capture interactions and dependencies along paths more intricately, thereby enabling more accurate predictions of PPMs (Path Performance Metrics) that are not directly observable in the network.\n2. During its training process, the DeepNT model integrates structural constraints with performance constraints. The core idea of this design philosophy is to merge the fundamental principles of network theory with the optimization process of machine learning, aimed at ensuring that the learned network topology not only complies with physical or logical feasibility but also reflects the actual network performance. This hybrid approach enhances the model's ability to infer the intrinsic structure and performance of the network.\n3. DeepNT exhibits a clear advantage in predicting path performance metrics compared to other existing state-of-the-art technologies. Moreover, DeepNT demonstrates particular robustness when dealing with large-scale and complex network structures. The experimental design of DeepNT takes into account various factors such as latency, bandwidth, packet loss rate, different network topologies, and various network operation scenarios. Furthermore, the experiments utilize multiple evaluation metrics to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Pooling operations, although helpful in simplifying data and reducing dimensions, can also lead to the loss of important information. Particularly in cases where paths are long or there is significant variation in node features, a single pooling operation may not be sufficient to capture all critical feature information, limiting the model's flexibility and accuracy in handling different types of network structures.\n2. Network states and structures in real-world applications are often dynamic, including the dynamic addition or removal of nodes and edges, as well as real-time changes in network traffic and congestion. These dynamic characteristics require network tomography models to be highly flexible and rapidly adaptable. If the DeepNT model relies primarily on static graph structures and previously learned features, its ability to quickly adapt to such dynamic changes may be limited. Especially when the model depends on long training periods and extensive historical data to predict network performance accurately, its responsiveness and accuracy in dealing with real-time or near-real-time network state changes may be inadequate.\n3. The DeepNT model does not consider the sequentiality of node paths, i.e., the order of nodes in the path, which might affect the model's performance in network tomography. Ignoring the sequentiality could lead to inaccurate predictions of certain network performance metrics.\n4. The DeepNT model trains using only a portion of the information available in the graph, which may result in poor performance when the model encounters network configurations or conditions that are not represented in the training data, i.e., poor generalization."

                "value": "- DeepNT proposed in this paper suppose the adjacent matrix is unknown or incomplete. Then how to construct the path sets $P_{uv}$ that represent the set of all possible paths from the node $u$ to $v$ without a specific adjacent matrix? How do we know which path has the optimal path performance? If the path performance can be tested by sending numbers of end-to-end probes, should the probing overhead be considered before the model training? Additionally, how to control the probes to traverse the specific routing paths is also a tough question since many networks do not support source routing.\n- On contribution of this paper is the design of the path performance triangle inequality. However, in many scenarios, the triangle inequality may not hold. For example, the delay between $<u,v>$ may not always be less than the delay of $<u,z> + <z,v>$ due to the load balancing policy in the current network. It is even less applicable in social networks.\n- In the experiments, the comparison with the baselines may not be entirely fair. In the scenarios of social networks, it's more like doing a matrix completion task. The seven baselines in the experiments are all within the area of network performance tomography, which were originally designed for network performance measurement. Hence, a more reasonable way is to compare DeepNT with matrix completion methods in such a scenario.\n- Network topology reconstruction is an important contribution in this paper. However, the experiments did not fully demonstrate the advantages in this part. The author only carried out the experiments when the topological error rate was set to 0.2. More experiments (e.g., higher missing rates or block missing) are required to validate the effectiveness of DeepNT."
