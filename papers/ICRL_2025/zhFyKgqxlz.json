    "title": "Exact Community Recovery under Side Information: Optimality of Spectral Algorithms",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of exact community recovery in general, two-community block models, in the presence of node-attributed *side information*. We allow for a very general side information channel for node attributes, and for pairwise (edge) observations, consider both Bernoulli and Gaussian matrix models, capturing the Stochastic Block Model, Submatrix Localization, and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-Synchronization as special cases. A recent work of Dreveton et al. 2024 characterized the information-theoretic limit of a very general exact recovery problem with side information. In this paper, we show algorithmic achievability in the above important cases by designing a simple but optimal spectral algorithm that incorporates side information (when present) along with the eigenvectors of the pairwise observation matrix. Using the powerful tool of entrywise eigenvector analysis [Abbe et al. 2020], we show that our spectral algorithm can mimic the so called *genie-aided estimators*, where the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ genie-aided estimator optimally computes the estimate of the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ label, when all remaining labels are revealed by a genie. This perspective provides a unified understanding of the optimality of spectral algorithms for various exact recovery problems in a recent line of work.",

Based on the recent work of Dreveton et al.

The main technical novelty lies in establishing a rigorous connection between the spectral estimator and the genie-aided estimator by the results on the first-order approximation of the eigenvectors in Abbe et al.

I suggest moving part of the theoretical discussion into the main text and possibly relocating some of the preliminaries to the appendix.\n\n Additionally, I am uncertain about the robustness of this algorithm, as the coefficients $c_i$ relating $w$ to eigenvectors must be computed from model parameters. However, in practice, we typically observe only the adjacency matrix and side information, without access to underlying parameters like $a_1, a_2, b$ in ${\\rm SBM}_n(\\rho, a_1,a_2, b)$. A discussion or clarification on this would be beneficial.\n \n  Another limitation of this paper is the lack of a numerical study. I suggest including simulation examples that compare the proposed algorithm\u2019s performance (in terms of accuracy and computation cost) with the existing two-stage algorithms. This would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the practical advantages of this approach."

Are there any general sufficient conditions that ensure $L(t)$, and consequently $I^*$, are well-defined? \n\n2. In Section 5.1, degree-profiling algorithm is mentioned as having certain caveat. However, it is unclear to me what this algorithm refers to. Perhaps adding a brief summary of the key points of this algorithm would improve clarity.\n\n3. On page 9, it is stated that an approximate linear combination coefficients $c_i$ such that $w\\approx \\sum_{i=1}^K c_i/\\lambda_i^* u_i^*$. Is there any intuitive explanation for why $w$ is approximately in the span of $u_i^*$? Is this result purely from the computations of the specific model (Gaussian and Bernoulli), or is there a broader rationale suggesting that this holds across more robust models? \n\n4. Regarding the algorithm, do the parameters $c_i$ and $\\gamma$ need be explicitly computed from the model parameters, or is there a possibility to estimate them using only the adjacency matrix $A$ and the side information?\n\n5. This final question may not be directly related to the problem considered in the paper. Dreveton et al (2024) provides  the information theoretic limit of exact recovery in terms of $I^*$.  I am curious whether the regime $I^*<1$ can be further split. Specifically, could we identify a sub-regime where exact recovery is achievable even without the side information, and another sub-regime where side information is essential with some specific conditions?"

Why is that? Is it possible to give a bound based on the definition of P+, P-, and Q, for instance? \n- Section 3.1: Does the information-theoretic bounds in Prop 3.1 contain anything novel, or just cited as is from [Dreveton et al., 2024]? If it is the latter, I strongly believe it should be moved to the preliminary section and not put in the \"Main Results\".\n- Theorem 1 and 2: The exact recovery condition depends on I* > 1. Is there any way to calculate this efficiently? From a reader's perspective, I'd love to see many examples of two community models and know how their parameters are related to this I*. For example, can the authors relate I* to p and q in the SBM?\n- The proofs like the concentration inequalities and the spectral analysis in the paper seem standard. In fact the union bound strategy feels similar to the ones in E. Abbe's and Dreveton's work. What are the technical contribution of this paper?

Specifically, the SBM model with $\\rho = 1/2$ and Gaussian Features aligns with Section 4 in [1] and should be cited and compared. Additionally, for the SBM with GF where $\\rho = 1/2$ and $a_1 = a_2 = a$, the expression for $I^*$ takes a simple form in Equation (4.4) of [1]. Providing explicit forms of $I^*$ for other models would enhance interpretability of the results.\n\n2. For SBM with BEC/BSC, the algorithms assume prior knowledge of parameters $(\\rho,\\varepsilon, \\alpha)$. The paper should mention this clearly and discuss why it's reasonable to assume this prior knowledge, or suggest how these parameters could be estimated. From a theory standpoint, achieving optimality might require paying a cost for adapting to these parameters, especially in regimes $\\varepsilon = n^{-\\beta}$ and $\\alpha = n^{-\\beta}$ for $\\beta>0$. \n\n3. The two-community assumption limits the algorithm\u2019s practical use. While I understand that the optimality of the spectral algorithm depends on this assumption, the statement in Appendix A, \"The entire framework of genie-aided estimation naturally generalizes to the multi-community case,\" is confusing.
