    "title": "IgSeek: Fast and Accurate Antibody Design via Structure Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in protein design have leveraged diffusion models to generate structural scaffolds, followed by a process known as protein inverse folding, which involves sequence inference on these scaffolds. However, these methodologies face significant challenges when applied to hyper-variable structures such as antibody Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs), where sequence inference frequently results in non-functional sequences due to hallucinations. Distinguished from prevailing protein inverse folding approaches, this paper introduces IgSeek, a novel structure-retrieval framework that infers CDR sequences by retrieving similar structures from a natural antibody database. Specifically, IgSeek employs a simple yet effective multi-channel equivariant graph neural network to generate high-quality geometric representations of CDR backbone structures. Subsequently, it aligns sequences of structurally similar CDRs and utilizes structurally conserved sequence motifs to enhance inference accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that IgSeek not only proves to be highly efficient in structural retrieval but also outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in sequence recovery for both antibodies and T-Cell Receptors, offering a new retrieval-based perspective for therapeutic protein design.",

Therefore, there can be potential data leakage. Previous work like RefineGNN or DiffAb adopt sequence-similarity split to avoid this problem.\n* Retrieving CDR sequences from known antibodies can lead to low novelty / non-specific binding of designed sequences. For example, if the task is to design CDRs that bind antigen A, IgSeek may retrieves a CDR from a known antibody that binds protein B. This CDR is unlikely to be a binder because it is designed specifically for protein B. And even if it does, it shows that this CDR is non-specific and this kind of non-specific binder is unfavorable. Therefore, casting protein design as a retrieval task has limitations."

Despite that, it\u2019s surprising to me that FoldSeek outperformed IgSeek in CDR-H3. \n\n- In Figure-3, the comparisons with Antifold and AbMPNN for amino acid recovery tasks are unfair, as these models are not specifically trained for CDR loops alone. As acknowledged by the authors, this biases the results in favour of IgSeek, potentially exaggerating its performance.\n\n- Figure-3 indicates that sorting by RMSD is more effective than using embeddings from IgSeek. Showing results based solely on RMSD (Kabsch) would provide a clearer performance baseline.\n\n- Figure-4 omits the inference time of the IgSeek+Kabsch method, although the authors use this method to argue that their approach outperforms others in Figure-3a/b. The added time from Kabsch alignment likely impacts overall inference speed, and a consistent comparison across methods is important.\n\n- In the CDR sequence recovery tasks, the authors sample two sequences per query and select the one that best aligns with the ground truth, which is biased. In practical applications, such as library design for real experiments, the ground truth is unknown.\n\n- IgSeek\u2019s effectiveness heavily relies on the quality and diversity of the antibody structure database, which may restrict its applicability. This dependency also limits its ability to generate novel, diverse sequences, reducing its utility for de novo design.\n\n- The paper does not specify how CDR regions are defined  (what numbering scheme is used?)\n\n- Generated sequences for a given CDR loop are constrained to a fixed length, limiting flexibility for generating variable-length sequences, although similar limitations apply to existing methods.\n\n\n**References:** \\\n[1] North B, Lehmann A, Dunbrack RL Jr. (2011).

From my point of view, they should compare the designed CDR structures (via some antibody-antigen folding prediction models such as Ab-Fold, AF3, etc.) with the ground truth structures. Besides, it is also necessary to evaluate the binding affinity or energy change between designed CDR and the original one, which can be difficult and can be implemented using some simulation tools such as Rosetta. My major concern is that you can not take the retrieved CDR struture for granted as the real one for designed CDR. Even if with the same sequences, these substructures can be significantly different in different antibody contexts. However, if the author have literactures or theories to support their point, I would be happy to discuss further."

The current task in this paper is more like a toy task, without considering all essential contexts and ultimate goals: given an antigen, we hope to design an optimal antibody that binds well with it. So from both sides of model design and evaluation, we should all take this factor into account. Can the author explain why they only care about CDR and believe a successful CDR match is adequate for antibody design? \n\n\n(2) The experimental results are heavily dependent on your split and curation of the dataset. In other words, if there are no similar CDRs in your CDR candidate databse, you can never find or retrieve a suitable CDR for test samples.
