    "title": "Angle Graph Transformer: Capturing Higher-Order Structures for Accurate Molecular Geometry Learning",
    "abstract": "Existing Graph Transformer models primarily focus on leveraging atomic and chemical bond properties along with basic geometric structures to learn representations of fundamental elements in molecular graphs, such as nodes and edges. However, higher-order structures like bond angles and torsion angles, which significantly influence key molecular properties, have not received sufficient attention. This oversight leads to inadequate geometric conformation accuracy and difficulties in precise local chirality determination, thereby limiting model performance in molecular property prediction tasks.\nTo address this issue, we propose the $A$ngle $G$raph $T$ransformer ($AGT$). AGT directly models directed bond angles and torsion angles, introducing higher-order structural representations to molecular graph learning for the first time. This approach enables AGT to determine local chirality within molecular representations and directly predict torsion angles. We introduce a novel directed cycle angle loss, allowing AGT to predict bond angles and torsion angles from low-precision molecular conformations. These properties, along with interatomic distances, are then applied to downstream molecular property prediction tasks using a pre-trained AGT with hierarchical virtual nodes.\nOur model achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the PCQM4Mv2 and OC20 IS2RE datasets. Through transfer learning, AGT also demonstrates competitive performance on molecular property prediction benchmarks including QM9, LIT-PCBA, MOLPCBA, and MOLHIV. Further ablation studies reveal that the conformations generated by our method most closely approximate DFT-generated conformations among existing methods, owing to the constraints imposed by bond angles and torsion angles.",

The training process demands substantial computational resources, requiring 38 A100 GPU days, yet the authors provide no discussion regarding the trade-offs between model size and performance improvements. Furthermore, the paper lacks any analysis of inference time complexity, making it difficult to assess the model's practical applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe paper's validation of key claims is notably insufficient. While the authors assert that \"predicting interatomic distances is insufficient to determine local chirality\" and present this as a key motivation for their work, they fail to provide any quantitative evaluation to support this claim. Although Figure 1 presents qualitative examples, it lacks a systematic evaluation of chirality prediction accuracy. The absence of comparisons with methods specifically designed for chirality prediction further weakens their argument about addressing this limitation effectively.\n\nThe paper's validation of key claims is notably insufficient.

References to models like Uni-mol and TGT do not conform to standard citation rules. Furthermore, the mention of DFT conformations lacks a proper introduction and citation, including the full form of DFT. This oversight reflects a lack of attention to detail and professionalism in writing, which could undermine the paper\u2019s credibility. To improve, the authors should ensure consistent citation formats and provide necessary background information on critical concepts like DFT.\n\n\u2461Incremental Improvement Over TGT: While AGT builds upon TGT by incorporating 3D information such as bond angles and torsion angles, this reliance on low-precision 3D conformations may be seen as a drawback. TGT can achieve good performance using only 2D structures, whereas AGT's additional complexity does not translate into significant performance gains. The authors should consider highlighting the specific advantages that 3D conformation provides and justify the need for such complexity in light of the modest improvements observed.\n\n\u2462Shallow Analysis in Ablation Study: The Ablation Study section does not provide in-depth analysis of the contributions of individual components. The numerical results are presented without sufficient context or discussion, particularly regarding the Mode Distribution. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore how different Mode Distributions impact model performance across various datasets, as this could reveal important insights into the model's behavior. A more comprehensive analysis would strengthen the paper\u2019s findings and provide clearer guidance for future research.\n\n\u2463DCA Loss presents some challenges that could impact its effectiveness. While it introduces an innovative method for angle prediction, its computational complexity may hinder efficiency, particularly with large molecular datasets. Additionally, DCA Loss could be sensitive to noise in the input data, which might adversely affect model performance. The effectiveness of the loss is highly dependent on weight tuning during training, and inadequate attention to this aspect could lead to suboptimal results. To enhance its applicability, the authors should consider strategies to improve robustness against noise and optimize computational efficiency, as well as provide clearer guidance on weight tuning to achieve the best outcomes."

I believe that the statement in the abstract, \u201cAGT directly models directed bond angles and torsion angles, introducing higher-order structural representations to molecular graph learning for the first time,\u201d as well as similar expressions in the main text, may contain overstated claims or lack clarity. To my knowledge, works like QuinNet[1] and ViSNet[2] also attempt to incorporate higher-order many-body interactions into networks to learn better force fields. Could the authors provide a clear explanation if my understanding is incorrect?\n2. I have reservations about the claim in section 3.1 that \u201cmethods predicting only interatomic distances cannot uniquely determine bond and torsion angles in the counterclockwise direction, as both \u03c3 and 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c3 can satisfy the same distance matrix in 3D space.\u201d While I understand that there may be molecules where the interatomic distance matrix remains unchanged under chirality variations, I believe that in most cases, if the positions of atoms in a local structure change in 3D space, the interatomic distances between those atoms and those in the unchanged part of the structure will necessarily change. Therefore, it would be more convincing if the authors could provide a more visual representation of this point, a formal description and proof, or a detailed analysis of the influence of local chirality within a specific dataset.\n3. On the PCQM4MV2 dataset, the performance improvement of AGT-127M compared to Uni-Mol+ -77M is only 0.2 (69.1 vs. 69.3), which I believe is not a favorable trade-off. However, both AGT-241M and AGT-127M show a significant performance gap when compared to TGT-203M.
