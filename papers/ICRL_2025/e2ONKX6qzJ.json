    "title": "Eliminating Oversaturation and Artifacts of High Guidance Scales in Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is crucial for improving both generation quality and alignment between the input condition and final output in diffusion models. While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.",

                "value": "We greatly appreciate the reviewer's helpful suggestions, as well as the positive assessment of the influence and quality of our work. Below, we provide detailed responses to the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n### **Lower precision at lower guidance scales**\nThe results in Figure 8 were compiled using fixed hyperparameters for momentum and normalization, which suggests that slight adjustments to these hyperparameters may be necessary depending on the guidance scale. At very low scales, the original CFG does not exhibit oversaturation, whereas APG with the fixed parameters from Figure 8 may introduce excessive normalization. However, as the guidance scale increases, the precision and FID of CFG degrade, while APG consistently maintains its quality. This is reflected in APG achieving better FID across a range of guidance scales and a superior minimum FID overall. Thus, APG enables the use of higher guidance scales without encountering the typical issues observed with CFG. Additionally, in our experiments, we found that by reducing normalization and momentum for lower guidance scales, APG can achieve results similar to or better than CFG.\n\n### **Motivation behind momentum**\nOur motivation for incorporating momentum is to filter out any common signals present across different CFG updates at various time steps. By taking a weighted running average of past updates and removing the overlapping component from the current update, we effectively retain only the new information at each step. We believe this approach helps limit the drift typically seen in CFG over multiple sampling steps. Table 2 shows that removing momentum results in a higher FID, demonstrating that momentum contributes to improved quality. We would be happy to expand on the intuition or add additional experiments on momentum in the final version."

                "value": "We wish to thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and for finding our work novel with detailed evaluations, good presentation, and significant contribution. Please find our answers to the comments below.\n\n### **HPSv2 and ImageReward**\nWe will examine the suggested metrics and will gladly consider them for the final version of the paper.\n\n### **Note on lower guidance scales**\nLower guidance scales generally avoid oversaturation, but often compromise output quality and alignment with the input. Throughout our experiments, we observed that APG performs robustly across a wide range of guidance scales, as illustrated in Figure 8. Additionally, we demonstrated that APG enables the use of higher guidance scales (such as $w=15$ for Stable Diffusion XL) that are typically infeasible with CFG, achieving high-quality generations that align well with the input condition without encountering common CFG issues. Thus, we do not believe that the benefits of APG are limited to certain guidance scales shown in the paper.\n\n### **Effect of the parallel component**\nAs shown in Table 2, results with and without the parallel component yield similar FID scores (computed over 10,000 generated samples); however, the model with the parallel component exhibits higher saturation. This suggests that the orthogonal component primarily drives FID, while the parallel component mainly influences saturation. For theoretical insight into this effect, we refer the reviewer to our \u201cgain\u201d argument in Section 4 (beginning around line 186 in the original manuscript).\n\n### **Example in figure 10**\nThis figure primarily illustrates improvements in text quality, where \"hello world\" is misspelled in the CFG figure. Since the base image for CFG contains artifacts (including two extra paws around the sign), our method successfully resolves one but not all of these artifacts in this case."

                "value": "We thank the reviewer for the positive reception of our paper and for recognizing its strengths. We also thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify several points.\n\n\n### **Analysis on rescaling the guidance weight**\nWe believe that the impact of APG extends beyond merely adjusting the guidance weight. A key observation is that modifying the parallel component causes a deviation from the CFG update rule. If we express CFG as $D(x, t, y) + w(D(x, t, y) - D(x, t))$, then we can show that applying the projection alters the update to $w\u2019 D(x, t, y) + w (D(x, t, y) - D(x, t))$ for some constant $w\u2019 \\neq 1$. This transformation cannot be achieved by simply modifying the guidance scale $w$ alone. Therefore, we argue that APG achieves more than just rescaling the CFG weight.\n\nFurthermore, in Appendix C.1, we present experiments combining APG with other methods that effectively adjust the guidance weight, specifically CADS and Interval Guidance (IG). The results indicate that combining APG with these methods yields the best FID compared to each method in isolation. This suggests that APG\u2019s benefits are, to some extent, orthogonal to CFG weight adjustments.\n\n### **Model for figure 8**\nFigure 8 was generated using the EDM2 model for class-conditional ImageNet generation.\n\n### **The trend of the rescale weight**\nWe observed that the norm of the updates increases during the initial steps of inference and then gradually approaches zero as denoising progresses. However, identifying a consistent pattern for this behavior is challenging, as it dynamically varies depending on the input prompt and random seed. We are happy to provide further analysis if this does not fully address the reviewer's comment.\n\n### **Illustrations of the geometry**\nWe would be glad to provide geometric diagrams illustrating the visual interpretation of each step in APG to help guide the reader\u2019s intuition for our approach. If this does not fully address the reviewer's point, we welcome further discussion."
