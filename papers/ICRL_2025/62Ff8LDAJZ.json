    "title": "Not-So-Optimal Transport Flows for 3D Point Cloud Generation",
    "abstract": "Learning generative models of 3D point clouds is one of the fundamental problems in 3D generative learning. One of the key properties of point clouds is their permutation invariance, i.e., changing the order of points in a point cloud does not change the shape they represent. In this paper, we analyze the recently proposed equivariant OT flows that learn permutation invariant generative models for point-based molecular data and we show that these models scale poorly on large point clouds. Also, we observe learning (equivariant) OT flows is generally challenging since straightening flow trajectories makes the learned flow model complex at the beginning of the trajectory. To remedy these, we propose not-so-optimal transport flow models that obtain an approximate OT by an offline OT precomputation, enabling an efficient construction of OT pairs for training. During training, we can additionally construct a hybrid coupling by combining our approximate OT and independent coupling to make the target flow models easier to learn. In an extensive empirical study, we show that our proposed model outperforms prior diffusion- and flow -based approaches on a wide range of unconditional generation and shape completion on the ShapeNet benchmark.",

However, these models lack sufficient discussion and comparative analysis, which would provide a clearer understanding of their strengths and limitations with the proposed method.\n2. The author asserts that diffusion models lack permutation-invariance in point cloud generation. However, recent studies, including [3], which use point-voxel representations; [4], which incorporate translation- and rotation-invariant features; and [5], which leverage latent diffusion models, are not included in the baselines for comparison.\n3. The author claims that the proposed method achieves high-quality generation with a limited number of inference steps. However, other fast sampling methods, such as [6], are not considered, which would offer a broader perspective on the efficiency of sampling approaches.\n4. While the author suggests that the proposed method scales well, there is no study on its performance across varying resolutions of 3D shapes. Furthermore, high-resolution 3D point generation methods, such as [7] and [8], are not included, which limits the scope of comparison for resolution-dependent generation quality.\n\n[1] Xie, Jianwen, et al. \"Generative pointnet: Deep energy-based learning on unordered point sets for 3d generation, reconstruction and classification.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2021.\n\n[2] Xie, Jianwen, et al. \"Generative VoxelNet: Learning energy-based models for 3D shape synthesis and analysis.\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 44.5 (2020): 2468-2484.\n\n[3] Zhou, Linqi, Yilun Du, and Jiajun Wu. \"3d shape generation and completion through point-voxel diffusion.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF international conference on computer vision. 2021.\n\n[4] Peng, Yong, et al. \"SE (3)-Diffusion: An Equivariant Diffusion Model for 3D Point Cloud Generation.\" International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing.

Additionally, the method necessitates separate training for each category, which not only diminishes efficiency and scalability but also requires extensive training time for each individual category.

The paper makes several significant contributions to the field of 3D point cloud generation. First, it provides a thorough analysis of existing OT-based methods, meticulously identifying their limitations in terms of scalability and computational overhead. Building on this analysis, the authors introduce an innovative approach combining superset OT precomputation with efficient online subsampling, addressing the identified scalability issues. They further enhance their methodology by proposing a hybrid coupling approach that cleverly combines OT and independent coupling, offering a more balanced solution.
