    "title": "A2Perf: Real-World Autonomous Agents Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Autonomous agents and systems cover a number of application areas, from robotics and digital assistants to combinatorial optimization, all sharing common, unresolved research challenges. It is not sufficient for agents to merely solve a given task; they must generalize to out-of-distribution tasks, perform reliably, and use hardware resources efficiently during training and on-device deployment, among other requirements. Several major classes of methods, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, are commonly used to tackle these problems, each with different trade-offs. However, there is currently no benchmarking suite that defines the environments, datasets, and metrics which can be used to develop reference implementations and seed leaderboards with baselines, providing a meaningful way for the community to compare progress. We introduce A2Perf---a benchmarking suite including three environments that closely resemble real-world domains: computer chip floorplanning, web navigation, and quadruped locomotion. A2Perf provides metrics that track task performance, generalization, system resource efficiency, and reliability, which are all critical to real-world applications. In addition, we propose a data cost metric to account for the cost incurred acquiring offline data for imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid algorithms, which allows us to better compare these approaches. A2Perf also contains baseline implementations of standard algorithms, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons across methods and facilitating progress in real-world autonomy. As an open-source and extendable benchmark, A2Perf is designed to remain accessible, documented, up-to-date, and useful to the research community over the long term.",

However, the exact contribution is unclear\u2014they primarily use pre-existing benchmarks and metrics previously proposed/used in other works. Is the novelty here simply the combination of these elements in a single accessible suite? While this can prove valuable, it still feels limited by the small set of available environments.\n2. Although the term 'autonomous agent' is used frequently here, it remains undefined. How much human intervention is permitted? Are there separate training and testing phases involving human input? Is a continual learning setup, as described in [1], considered?\n3. Generalization as a key metric\u2014This metric seems vaguely defined. Why should it be reasonable to expect a policy trained on task 1 to perform well on task 2 without additional training or fine-tuning? Does generalization here only refer to task performance, or does it also encompass task representation and knowledge of the environment?\n4. Although the paper addresses real-world applications, its evaluation is limited to simulation benchmarks. For instance, how would evaluation differ with a real robot dog? What about factors like reset time between episodes or the need for human intervention?\n5. The paper also overlooks the robustness of hyper-parameters. Given that deep RL algorithms are notoriously sensitive to hyperparameter choices, shouldn't this be considered part of the training costs?\n6. Justification for metrics specified in Table 3 is insufficient. The authors should consider additional metrics from [3] and [4] when evaluating application performance.\n7. The paper lacks citations for large-scale benchmarks such as RoboHive [5], which supports a wide range of robot embodiments.\n\n**References**\n1. Dohare, S., Hernandez-Garcia, J.

This discrepancy is not currently reflected in the proposed metrics. Do the authors have any thoughts on this matter?\n6. Similar to the previous question, how would Sim2Real approaches fit into this benchmark?\n7.  Why not integrate with existing benchmarks like this instead of focusing on a specific implementation, such as quadruped locomotion?"

The benchmark uses several performance metrics including a newly proposed metric named data cost that measures the cost of collecting a dataset for offline learning. Other metrics such as system performance and reliability ought to test for practical applicability of algorithms. The work provides an evaluation on all three environments using a set of the proposed metrics on each. The work ends with an experimental section concluding that online RL generally has higher energy cost, offline methods have higher data cost. A final experiment demonstrates the pros and cons of RL methods using reliability metrics."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Motivation  \na) While I do find the general motivation of this work timely, it is not clear to me why these specific environments were chosen and how they relate. \n\n2. Claims and Novelty  \na) It seems that the novelty of this manuscript is limited as most metrics are already known and the environments that are being considered already exist. It seems that the main contribution is to assign existing metrics to existing benchmarks. The exception is the novel data metric that is being introduced. However, as I outline later I\u2019m not convinced of the usefulness of this metric.  \nb) The motivation for the work seems to be largely based on the claim that evaluation in other benchmarks is missing. One of the initial claims is that \u201cThere is currently no benchmarking suite that defines the environments, datasets, and metrics which can be used to develop reference implementations and seed leaderboards with baselines\u201d (L18) This seems to be a very strong statement given the rise of a large number of benchmarks recently.  \nc) \u201cMost [other benchmarks] only evaluate an agent\u2019s raw performance on the same task on which it was trained, without considering numerous other metrics that matter in real-world production training and deployment scenarios.\u201d (L46) There are various environments and datasets with proposed metrics that measure benchmark related quantities. Some examples:\n* [1b, 2b] Continual learning benchmarks measure metrics such as forgetting and collapse.\n* [3b] Suggests to evaluate various dataset sizes which seems similar to the data metric proposed in this manuscript.\n* [4b, 13b] Measure constraint violation for practical safety features.  \nd) I am going to interpret Table 1 in the paper as a claim. I do not agree that Safety Gym and CoinRun do not measure reliability. Safety gym explicitly measures violations of constraints which can be interpreted as reliable. The number of tasks an agent can solve out of distribution in CoinRun should have to count as a measure of how reliable a system is to perturbation.  Similarly it is unclear to me why Safety Gym tasks are considered realistic but DM Control is not.\n\n3. Related work  \na) The treatment of related work could be improved.\n* Given the recent rise of new benchmarks after the introduction of the datasets and benchmarks track at NeurIPS. 8/9 of the benchmarks listed in Table 1 are from 2020 or older. Here is a non-exhaustive list of recent potentially relevant benchmarks [1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12b, 13b] and datasets [14b, 15b, 16b, 17b]  \n* The reliability metrics only get cited in section 3 even though the intro states \"our reliability metrics\" (L92) which might lead to confusion about attribution.\n\n4. Metrics  \na) Most of the suggested metrics already exist, see [8, 12, 50] in the paper. Systems performance metrics can quite easily be tracked using frameworks such was Weights&Biases nowadays too.  \nb) The data cost metric seems inconsistent since any method can use a fixed dataset that already exist. The major upside of using datasets is that the cost of data collection is amortized over time. Once a dataset exists, it can be re-used and it is unclear to me why existing data should be tied to specific methods. Further, it seems odd that all RL agents show 0 data cost as they do need to collect data. In general, RL sample efficiency is significantly lower and it seems incorrect to claim that offline methods have lower data cost. I suppose the argument is supposed to be that this data collection requires human effort to gather expert demonstrations but then the metric is measured using energy consumed to train RL policies which do not require human effort.  \nc) It seems a little contrived to consider system metrics algorithm dependent rather than hyperparameter dependent. For instance, I could simply change the batch size of my DDQN algorithm an increase the VRAM usage. In section 5.2, if I simply decrease the number of parallel processes, the peak RAM usage would be lower but other metrics would not be affected. I think in order for this to be useful, clearer guidelines are needed on how exactly to measure these metrics.\n\nOverall, I agree with the final assessment that we need more holistic metrics to measure progress in L532. However, it's not entirely clear what unique advantages this benchmark offers beyond existing methods. I think the scientific contributions are limited and the proposed metrics either already exist, are possibly of low utility or at least require more detailed elaboration on how to use them. The benchmark environments also already exist. The experiments provide an interesting study but do not provide sufficient novel insights for me to argue acceptance to ICLR at this time.\n\n[1b] Continual World: A Robotic Benchmark For Continual Reinforcement Learning.
