    "title": "ELCC: the Emergent Language Corpus Collection",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Emergent Language Corpus Collection (ELCC): a collection of corpora generated from open source implementations of emergent communication systems across the literature. These systems include a variety of signalling game environments as well as more complex tasks environments like a social deduction game and embodied navigation. Each corpus is annotated with metadata describing the characteristics of the source system as well as a suite of analyses of the corpus (e.g., size, entropy, average message length, performance as transfer learning data). Currently, research studying emergent languages requires directly running different systems which takes time away from actual analyses of such languages, makes studies which compare diverse emergent languages rare, and presents a barrier to entry for researchers without a background in deep learning. The availability of a substantial collection of well-documented emergent language corpora, then, will enable research which can analyze a wider variety of emergent languages; this more effectively uncovers general principles in emergent communication rather than artifacts of particular environments. We provide some quantitative and qualitative analyses with ELCC to demonstrate potential use cases of the resource in this vein.",

In Emergent Communication (EC), researchers are generally required to be familiar with deep learning, reinforcement learning, and machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch to simulate the emergence of language and communication. However, not all of the previous EC studies provide well-documented, high-quality, and open-source implementations, which prevents us from performing the meta-analysis of the EC studies and non-ML researchers from joining the EC field. To mitigate such problems, this paper introduces ELCC, collecting several appropriate open-source implementations, conducting reproduction experiments, summarizing the experimental results (i.e., emergent languages) as \"corpora,\" and performing some basic evaluations (e.g., n-gram entropy, XferBench). The author(s) suggest that ELCC can also be used for further analyses (e.g., word boundaries, syntax)."

                "value": "- ELCC is not annotated with meanings (or semantics, inputs) corresponding to messages (sentences). This would be somewhat problematic when the EC researchers want to evaluate other properties, such as compositionality.\n- The basic analyses provided (e.g., XferBench) are indeed valid in showing the \"negative result\" (i.e., that emergent language is not similar to human language). However, I am not sure if the provided metrics are still valid in showing the \"positive result\" in the future (i.e., that emergent language is similar enough to human language), recalling some (computational) linguistic literature claiming that even monkey-typing sequences follow a Zipf-like distribution [1], that even pre-training with simple artificial language ($\\neq$ emergent language) has a positive influence on downstream task performance [2], etc. This is another reason I think ELCC should be annotated with semantic information to allow future EC researchers to perform more detailed analyses.\n- I feel references (only) to Ueda et al. (2023) and van der Wal et al. (2019) in some parts of the Introduction and Discussion sections are somewhat abrupt, considering a number of  EC papers have studied human language-ness of emergent languages from various points of view. I know typical topics in the field, like TopSim-based compositionality, are out of this paper's scope.

A clear example of ELCC\u2019s utility, such as its potential to generate new insights, would enhance its justification. Additionally, the static nature of the ELCC collection raises questions about the kinds of research it enables and what insights it may provide beyond those already published by the corresponding papers. A leaderboard with well-defined datasets, metrics, and results might be more impactful than a static collection of generated languages.\n\nFurthermore, while the ELCC corpus could have been used to evaluate the soundness and completeness of various EC evaluation metrics proposed in the literature, the analysis is mostly limited to XferBench. For example, although the authors mention the HAS metric (Lines 464-468), they only discuss it theoretically rather than demonstrating how ELCC could aid in evaluating this metric across languages.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper lacks innovative contributions, and the provided resource appears too limited to address key challenges in the field, such as establishing standardized EC benchmarks with readily available datasets and evaluation metrics."
