    "title": "ProdInfluencerNet: A Novel Product-Centric Influencer Recommendation Framework Based on Heterogeneous Networks",
    "abstract": "With the proliferation of social media, influencer marketing has emerged as a popular strategy for brands to promote their products. Recent studies have increasingly explored the use of machine learning to recommend suitable influencers for brands. This typically involves analyzing the compatibility of influencer profiles with brand attributes. However, for brands entering new markets or promoting products in unfamiliar categories, existing solutions may be limited due to insufficient information for accurate compatibility matching.\n\nIn this paper, we propose ProdInfluencerNet (PIN), a product-centric framework designed for influencer recommendation. PIN effectively models the complex relationships between brands, products, and influencers using Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). We categorize sponsored post images using the Google Taxonomy through image classification techniques. By leveraging the taxonomy's hierarchical structure and adopting an inductive learning approach, PIN can accurately recommend influencers for brands, even in new markets or with innovative products. We validate PIN's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods using two Instagram datasets. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that text features in profiles are more critical than images for identifying cooperative relationships between product categories and influencers.",

                "value": "The paper introduces PIN, a framework designed to recommend influencers for brands based on a product-centric approach. PIN utilizes HINs to effectively model the intricate relationships between brands, products, and influencers. A standout feature of PIN is its use of Google Taxonomy for categorizing sponsored post images through image classification techniques, which allows for accurate influencer recommendations even in new markets or with novel products. The framework employs an inductive learning approach, enhancing its capability to generalize and perform well with unseen product categories, thus addressing the cold-start issue effectively."

However, there is compard with only one baseline GNN-IR, which heavily limits the technical contribution. For example, there are many recent HIN recommendation baselines and item cold-start recommendation models should be compared. This part is very improtant to evaluate the effectiveness of the model."

Additionally, the information for GNN-IR in Tables 1 and 2 appears to be incorrect. It is not very convincing to have only one straightforward GNN baseline, even though several configuration-sweeping experiments of PIN are conducted. An intuitive baseline might involve using products directly rather than product categories. It would also be beneficial to consider non-GNN baselines.\n\n- Problem formulation and related work: The influencer recommendation problem seems to be similar to the regular recommendation problem. If this is the case, more methods like collaborative filtering or more advanced deep learning methods should be considered. If not, the unique challenges of influencer recommendation should be adequately discussed.\n\n- Contributions: The primary contribution of this paper over the baseline GNN-IR is the use of a Heterogeneous Information Network, which is already widely used (e.g., in movie recommendation applications as shown in Fig. 2). While it is beneficial to use product categories to connect both sides, the technical contributions appear to be limited."
