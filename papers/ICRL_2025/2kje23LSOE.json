    "abstract": "This paper concerns the application of techniques from optimal transport (OT) to mean field control,  in which the probability measures of interest in OT correspond to empirical distributions associated with a large collection of controlled agents. The control objective of interest motivates a one-sided relaxation of OT,  in which the first marginal is fixed and the second marginal is constrained to a  \u201cmoment class\u201d: a set of probability measures defined by generalized moment constraints. This relaxation is particularly interesting for control problems as it enables the coordination of agents without the need to know the desired distribution beforehand. The inclusion of an entropic regularizer is motivated by both computational considerations, and also to impose hard constraints on agent behavior. A computational approach inspired by the Sinkhorn algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This new approach to distributed control is illustrated with an application of charging a fleet of electric vehicles while satisfying grid constraints. An online version is proposed and applied in a case study on the ElaadNL dataset containing 10,000 EV charging transactions in the Netherlands. This empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach to optimizing flexibility while respecting grid constraints.",

The paper seems to say that the controllable variables are the EV arrival time and state-of-charge? But these are typically the main source of randomness in EV problems. The controllable knobs are typically the charging profiles. \n- How many EVs does there need to be for a mean field approximation to be valid? At any single charging station, there won't be that many EVs."

I suggest the authors add more discussions about the connections between the general framework and a specific example (e.g., the EV charging problem) that is easier to understand. Discussing the intuition/significance after stating each proposition or lemma is also helpful.\n\nFor the experiment part, I encourage the authors to compare the problem setting and the performance with related works on EV charging (e.g., [1]).

The reviewer was confused by the abstract and couldn't understand what contributions were made in this paper at first. The authors barely use phrases like 'this paper' or 'we,' so the actions taken in the paper were not distinguished clearly. It seems this issue occurs throughout the paper as well. The reviewer feels that the authors didn't clearly articulate the prior approaches, what they did new, and what the advantages are. This makes it challenging to understand the contributions they are claiming.\n\n**Contribution:**\nTo the best of the reviewer's understanding, the contribution of this paper is that they are establishing the theoretical background to leverage computational techniques from optimal control theory to the mean field control problem, as presented in sections 2.1 and 2.2. In Proposition 2, they provide the calculation of derivatives for their problem and introduce a gradient descent-based algorithm in section 2.3. Then they directly jump to the experiments, and sections 3 and 4 consist of explanations of their experiments. However, the reviewer believes they should have provided more discussion about the method before proceeding to the experiments, for example, the motivation behind the specific design of the algorithm, or theoretical analysis, or some justifications for why they expect it would work well.\n\nAdditionally, the reviewer couldn't grasp what the authors were trying to claim with the experiments. The reviewer believes the authors should have provided guidance on interpreting their experimental results and offered clear conclusions or messages derived from the experiments. However, most of the content in the experiment section seems to focus on the details of the experiments.\n\n**Minor issues:**\n- Typo in line 072; a space between \"S.It\" is required.\n- Typo in line 077; \"litterature\" should be corrected.\n- Typo in line 419; \"(i)\" should be changed to \"(ii).\""

I urge the authors to consider once again whether the ICLR audience is what this paper is shooting for (without any offense at all to either the paper or the ICLR audience). For instance, the L in ICLR stands for \"learning\". Yet, any connection to learning -- if there is any -- remains unexplained. My issues largely stem from this perceived mismatch:\n\n- relegating the proofs, including the central results (Proposition 1/2), to the appendix probably does not make the paper more readable to the non-experts (who will find notation burdensome to start with), and only signals (possibly incorrectly) that the authors do not see these results as their primary contribution. In that case, I am not sure what is the primary contribution\n\n- there seems to be some dissonance between the claimed contributions (which speak about control of an ensemble of agents), the actual technical contributions (which can indeed serve this goal, but the connection is not really described in detail), and the application (which is farfetched at best: why should the power consumption exactly track a reference trajectory?)\n\n- the \"second\" technical part of the paper, coming within the application section, applies largely domain-agnostic mathematical theory to a problem that is tailored to the application (which is, as I already mentioned, farfetched). My suggestion would really be to split this paper into two: the first one dealing with the general problem of MCOT-C (and its online version in as much generality as possible), with perhaps only a small academic example if there is no room for more, and the second one applied, with a realistic case study and a detailed description of the algorithm implementation and possible minor modifications\n\n- partly because of decoupling of the proof (and a weird ordering of the proofs in the Appendix), it is not clear to me how challenging the main result actually is: the duality seems rather straightforward. If this is not the case, that should be emphasized. If it is, perhaps it would be good to try to develop online results on MCOT-C in more generality"
