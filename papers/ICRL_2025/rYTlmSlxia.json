    "title": "From Data to Model: Anomaly Detection of 3D GPR Data in CuDeRes Model Space",
    "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) offers in-depth subterranean insights, yet subsurface anomaly detection in GPR data remains challenging due to limited training data, typically confined to some normal data samples free from any subsurface structures or anomalies, and the variability of subsurface conditions. In response, this paper introduces practical and accurate subsurface anomaly detection within the Cubic Decay Reservoir Network (CuDeRes) model space. Our approach employs commonly available normal GPR data, segmented into blocks. Each data block is independently fitted using the introduced CuDeRes, which incorporates three reservoirs with spatial decay to adequately capture the data-inherent multi-directional dynamics, resulting in a compact fitted readout model. Representing each data block with the fitted model, together with the distance measurement between models, the original GPR data blocks are mapped into the CuDeRes model space, and the fitted models are collected into a \"Model Depot\". For subsequent anomaly detection in newly collected GPR data, the same segmentation and CuDeRes fitting approaches are applied, where the data blocks are represented by fitted models for comparative assessment against the model depot. Anomalies are detected through model dissimilarities, and subsequently clustered within the CuDeRes model space, allowing us to accurately identify the data blocks with potential subsurface anomalies and ascertain their anomaly types. Experiments on real-world GPR data demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach, notably using only limited normal data.",

Reproducibility of the Method: We have provided demo code and examples in the supplementary material. The proposed method is fully reproducible.\n\nw2. Major Baselines Missing in the Experiments: The methods by Liu et al. and Zhou et al. (D3 model and CubeRes) rely on training and optimization based on data from different anomaly categories. In contrast, our work uses only normal data for anomaly detection, making it a different task and therefore not directly comparable.\n\nw3. Simple Ablations Missing: Our CuDeRes approach is constructed using reservoir computing, where connections between neighboring points are built through hidden states rather than direct associations in the original data. We conducted ablation studies and discussions, including removing the spatial decay mechanism (shown as \u201cCuDeRes(w/o E)\u201d in Table 2), and discussed single-direction ESN fitting on lines 453-458 of page 9. Due to the large dimensionality of the readout model, single-direction ESN fitting cannot be applied to 3D GPR data.\n\ni1. Specification of Values for x\u2082 - x\u2081, y\u2082 - y\u2081, and z\u2082 - z\u2081: These represent the distances between neighboring points along three spatial directions. Regarding the width of a block (2.5m), this corresponds to the distance from the first to the 16th channel, meaning X2\u2212X1=2.5/16X_2 - X_1 = 2.5/16X2\u2212X1=2.5/16.\n\ni2. Rename \u201cNext Point Prediction\u201d to \u201cReconstruction\u201d: This is a good suggestion, and we agree with the change.\n\ni3. Clarification on the Probability Density (Line 330): There is no direct relationship between the probability density and the ground truth distribution of GPR images. We apologize for any confusion caused by this wording.\n\ni4. Conditions on Random Parameters W^x, W^y, and W^z: The Echo State Property (ESP) is a condition in reservoir computing to maintain system stability. It is not unique to our work or a primary contribution of this paper. We apologize for not making this clearer."

                "value": "We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s recognition of our work. Below are our responses to the raised points:\n\nScalability and Computational Efficiency: CuDeRes fitting for each data block requires only a single ridge regression (see Equation 5), with no iterative training needed. This is a key advantage of reservoir computing, allowing for efficient fitting. Additionally, the model distance metrics are directly solvable, ensuring that our method is feasible for real-time applications and scalable to large datasets.\n\nRobustness in Anomaly Typing: The clustering results for CuDeRes are presented in Figure 6 and Table 3. To further verify the model\u2019s discriminative ability across various anomaly categories, we applied three different clustering methods, achieving robust performance in anomaly type clustering.\n\nDistance Measures: As the CuDeRes readout model is not a vector, Euclidean distance is unsuitable for direct application. Previous studies in model space-based approaches have validated the effectiveness of the p-norm distance. Given the limited normal data available in our anomaly detection context, optimizing the distance metric would be challenging due to insufficient data support.\n\nParameter Sensitivity: We have provided details on the primary parameter settings and ranges in the Experiment section and the Appendix, along with necessary discussions.\n\nAblation Study: We conducted ablation studies. The results without the spatial decay mechanism (\u201cwithout the spatial decay mechanism\u201d) are shown as \u201cCuDeRes(w/o E)\u201d in Table 2. Results for \u201csingle-direction fitting\u201d are discussed in lines 453-458 on page 9, where, due to the high dimensionality of the readout model, single-direction ESN fitting is impractical for 3D GPR data."

For instance, how does the model perform without the spatial decay mechanism or when using single-direction fitting instead of multi-directional fitting? Additionally, would testing alternative distance metrics or varying reservoir sizes provide insights into which design choices are most critical for effective anomaly detection?"

Can you compare agains them?\n\nw3. simple ablations missing, e.g., blurring pixels based on their\n  neighbors' observed intensities.\n- Your method is specific in the sense that your blurring operation\n  in eq. 1 blurs progressively: the value of the next pixel depends\n  on the already blurred values of previous pixels. This leads to\n  a very deep architecture. Can you compare on a simple setup\n  where you blur on just the observed values of the neighbors?\n- You fix theta to 1 and test only against theta = 0 (\"w/o E\").\n  Can you run a full parameter sensitivity analysis for theta?\n\nThere also are some smaller issues that the authors could\nlook into:\n- i1. Your model does not depend on x_a, y_b and z_c, but just\n  on x_{a+1}-x_a (in eq. 3). You could simplify your representation\n  by just using indices a, b, c and say what scaling factors you\n  use in eq. 3.\n  - Can you specify what these 3 numbers,  x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1 and z_2-z_1\n    are in your experiment? \n  - line 417 you say the \"width\" of a block is 2.5m.

Can you clarify?\n- i2. line 293 you characterize the task as \"next point prediction\".\n  But in your case u(x_a, y_b, z_c) is one of the inputs. So would\n  it not be more appropriate to call it a reconstruction (from a\n  blurred input)?\n- i3. line 330 \"\\mu(x) denotes the probability density over the input\n  domain\" one easily could read as if you mean the ground truth\n  distribution of the GPR images. But then you clarify to assume\n  a uniform distribution.\n- i4.
