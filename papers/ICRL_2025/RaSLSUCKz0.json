    "title": "SQL-GEN: Bridging the Dialect Gap for Text-to-SQL Via Synthetic Data And Model Merging",
    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL systems, that convert natural language queries into SQL programs, have seen significant progress with recent breakthroughs.  However,  these have been primarily for the SQLite dialect and adapting Text-to-SQL systems to other SQL dialects like BigQuery and PostgreSQL remains a challenge due to the diversity  in  SQL  syntaxes  and  functions,  along  with  the  high  cost  of  collecting and curating SQL-specific training data.   To this end,  we introduce SQL-GEN,a framework for generating high-quality synthetic data for any dialect guided by dialect-specific tutorials.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of SQL-GEN in creating training data to significantly improve the downstream Text-to-SQL performance for other dialects \u2013 it improves the execution accuracy by up to 20% over previous  methods,  and  reduces  the  gap  with  large-scale  human-annotated  data on unseen real world multi-dialect benchmarks.  Moreover, combining our synthetic data with human-annotated data provides additional performance boosts up to 5.6%. Towards unifying the multi-dialect capability in a single system, we also introduce a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) initialization method that integrates dialect-specific models by merging self-attention layers and initializing the gates with dialect-specific keywords, yielding one unified and versatile model adept for multiple SQL dialects,  further enhancing performance across different SQL dialects. By leveraging shared core features of multiple dialect-specific models, our MOE demonstrated superior performance compared with models trained on individual dialects alone",

SQL-GEN enhances execution accuracy by up to 20% over previous methods, making Text-to-SQL models more reliable for multi-dialect databases, with potential performance improvements in specific dialects like PostgreSQL and BigQuery.\n4.

While SQL-GEN aims to create a unified model that bridges dialect gaps, merging dialect-specific models can dilute the depth of expertise for each dialect, leading to a possible trade-off between dialect-specific expertise and generalizability. It would be better to discuss the drawback of SQL-GEN in each dialect-specific example and provide a detailed analysis of performance on dialect-specific features or edge cases for each dialect. This could help clarify if and where any expertise dilution occurs.\n\n2. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach enables the merging of dialect-specific models, but it also requires substantial computational resources for training, fine-tuning, and deploying models, especially as more dialects are added. It would be better to incorporate an easy SFT baseline to compare and provide a computational resource comparison between their MoE approach and a standard fine-tuning approach for multiple dialects. This would give readers a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved."

What measures are in place to ensure the synthetic queries generated by SQL-GEN align closely with real-world dialect usage beyond benchmarks?"
