    "title": "Neuralized Markov Random Field for Interaction-Aware Stochastic Human Trajectory Prediction",
    "abstract": "Interactive human motions and the continuously changing nature of intentions pose significant challenges for human trajectory prediction. In this paper, we present a neuralized Markov random field (MRF)-based motion evolution method for probabilistic interaction-aware human trajectory prediction. We use MRF to model each agent's motion and the resulting crowd interactions over time, hence is robust against noisy observations and enables group reasoning. We approximate the modeled distribution using two conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) for efficient learning and inference. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADE/FDE metrics across two dataset categories: overhead datasets ETH/UCY, SDD, and NBA, and ego-centric JRDB. Furthermore, our approach allows for real-time stochastic inference in bustling environments, making it well-suited for a 30FPS video setting. We will open-source our codes upon paper acceptance.",

By integrating MRF with neural networks, the model captures both individual movement patterns and inter-agent interactions over time, effectively addressing uncertainties in predicting human motion. This design is particularly well-suited for real-time trajectory forecasting."

                "value": "I have two main concerns: [A] the method description is unclear, and [B] the two-stage approach is not well-motivated and not well-ablated. \n\n[A] I find the data description in LL158-161 confusing: could the authors clearly state what the input modalities are, i.e. are those per-person trajectories in 2D, are they collections of 2D per-person trajectories, how are they normalized/standardized - in what coordinate frame are they? \nThis also makes it difficult to follow the rest of the method description as it is unclear what the inputs/outputs are.\nThe authors make repeated use of the word \u201cjoint configuration space\u201d (i.e. L165) - could they elaborate what that means?\n\nL161: what are those \u201cM individual states\u201d?\n\nThe authors use various words to describe there tracklets and the length, i.e. \u201cstride\u201d, \u201cchunk\u201d, \u201cperiod\u201d, \u201ctime chunk\u201d - I would suggest to stick to one to make it easier to read.\n\nL182-L183: It is unclear here what the parameterizations are, i.e. what are the differences between \\theta_u, \\theta_m and \\theta_j \u2014> this needs more details here and not just in the following chapters (Maybe also reference Figure 2 here..).\n\nCan the authors clarify what they mean by L070: \u201cHuman movements are Markovian up to certain frequencies\u201d ?\n\n\n\n[B] Concerns wrt Two-stage approach\nI wonder if the split into Stage 1 (Bayesian Update) and Stage 2 is necessary. My main concern is that Stage 2 has no information about motion of the past beyond the previous segment S_{t-1}), while the segments seem to be rather short, as indicated in Table 7 (right side). I find it surprising that the method does not need to rely on past motion beyond a few frames to make more accurate predictions.\n\nFor example, just recursively applying the \u201cBayesian update\u201d step (Stage 1) should perform better, as it has access to more historic information. I believe this is what the authors evaluated in Table 4 and 5 (\u201cOurs (Stage 1)\u201d) - could the authors confirm that this is indeed the case? They should more clearly describe this baseline / ablation in text. Also, it is surprising that this performs worse than the MRF as this method can exploit past motion better than the MRF. Could the authors elaborate what causes the Bayesian update step to be outperformed here?\n\nOn a similar note, if Stage 2 (self-evolution + interaction) seems to perform better, I wonder if the Stage 1 is even necessary as the initial Segment S_1 can be obtained from the historic motion sequence. I wonder how \u201cOurs (Stage 2 only)\u201d would perform in this case.\n\nA two-stage approach is more complicated and brittle and thus it is important to clearly motivate each part, which has not been done in the ablation.\n\n*Suggestions*\n\nAdd relative speeds to Table 3 where the fastest method is 1 and the others are multiples of it.\n\nFor the stride size in Table 7 (right) I would suggest to add the time in seconds as well"

As mentioned in the related work, there are already trajectory prediction methods that use the Markov property. Additionally, there are existing methods that construct a dynamic graph based on agents' positions to account for interactions between them (e.g., HiVT (CVPR\u201922), QCNet (CVPR\u201923)). The proposed approach seems like a combination of these two approaches, which might not meet the standards for ICLR.\n* I initially thought that using CVAE would introduce stochasticity, but it\u2019s odd to see deterministic samplers are used during stage 2. In that case, why split it into two stages? Couldn\u2019t deterministic sampling alone without CVAE sampling be trained and used for inference? The referenced Non-probability Sampling (Bae, CVPR\u201922) also suggests that deterministic sampling is preferable to random sampling, so I don\u2019t understand why both random and deterministic sampling were used here. The ablation only compares with stage 1 alone; ablation results of state 2 only without CVAE sampling are needed."
