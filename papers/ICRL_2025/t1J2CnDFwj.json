    "title": "Enhance Multi-View Classification Through Multi-Scale Alignment and Expanded Boundary",
    "abstract": "Multi-view classification aims at unifying the data from multiple views to complementarily enhance the classification performance. Unfortunately, two major problems in multi-view data are damaging model performance. The first is feature heterogeneity, which makes it hard to fuse features from different views. Considering this, we introduce a multi-scale alignment module, including an instance-scale alignment module and a prototype-scale alignment module to mine the commonality from an inter-view perspective and an inter-class perspective respectively, jointly alleviating feature heterogeneity. The second is information redundancy which easily incurs ambiguous data to blur class boundaries and impair model generalization. Therefore, we propose a novel expanded boundary by extending the original class boundary with fuzzy set theory, which adaptively adjusts the boundary to fit ambiguous data. By integrating the expanded boundary into the prototype-scale alignment module, our model further tightens the produced representations and reduces boundary ambiguity. Additionally, compared with the original class boundary, the expanded boundary preserves more margins for classifying unseen data, which guarantees the model generalization. Extensive experiment results across various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Equation 17 represents the overall optimization objective, involving four different loss functions. Why do the penalty coefficients apply to only two of these loss functions?\n3. Figure 5 in the appendix should include variance, as it is a key aspect of stability analysis.\n4. There are many minor issues that need refinement. For example, the first column in Table 1 should be labeled \"datasets\" instead of \"methods.\"\n5. The experiments were conducted using eight 24GB 3090 GPUs, but there are still out-of-memory issues reported in Table 1. This clearly indicates that the model's complexity and computational overhead require analysis and comparison, including metrics such as runtime, MACs, FLOPs, and parameters."
