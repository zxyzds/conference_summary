    "title": "Are spectral augmentations necessary in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning?",
    "abstract": "The recent surge in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning has prominently featured an intensified exploration of spectral cues. Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph\u2019s spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions or heuristic approaches regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. This paradox raises the critical question of whether spectral augmentations are really necessary for contrast-based graph self-supervised learning. This study undertakes an extensive investigation into this inquiry, conducting a thorough study of the relationship between spectral characteristics and the learning outcomes of contemporary methodologies. Based on this analysis, we claim that the effectiveness and significance of spectral augmentations need to be questioned. Instead, we revisit simple edge perturbation: random edge dropping designed for node-level self-supervised learning and random edge adding intended for graph-level self-supervised learning. Compelling evidence is presented that these simple yet effective strategies consistently yield superior performance while demanding significantly fewer computational resources compared to existing spectral augmentation methods. The proposed insights represent a significant leap forward in the field, potentially reshaping the understanding and implementation of graph self-supervised learning.",

However, spectral analysis of graph neural networks has enriched the theoretical understanding of GNN models from different perspectives. While bringing focus to the current shortcomings of spectral augmentations is relevant, the paper does not provide a conclusive (theoretical) evidence that would warrant a categorical dismissal of spectral augmentation-based graph self-supervised learning algorithms."

                "value": "While the paper will be of broad interest to the graph learning community, there are a number of aspects that need more insights to make it more effective.\n+ In Fig.1, the superior performance of shallow GNNs is interpreted as an evidence for the claim that incorporating spectral information can affect the quality of the learned representations. However, there are a number of known issues in training deeper graph neural networks such as over-smoothing, difficulty in preserving locality, noise propagation etc. (see references like Bag of Tricks for Training Deeper Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study, IEEE TPAMI 2022). This has led to the use of mitigation strategies like skip connections, layer normalization or even spectral GNNs. While the utility of the inductive biases even in shallow GNNs is clear from results (and also other existing studies), extending that observation to the claim on spectral information hurting representation quality needs additional empirical and theoretical justification.\n+ While the performance improvements of edge perturbation over SPAN is apparent from the results in Table 2 and Table 3, it is not clear why DROPEDGE is significantly superior to ADDEDGE in node classification, while they are comparable (ADDEDGE is sometimes even superior) in graph classification. Can the authors explain this behavior?\n+ The analysis in Figure 2 shows that DROPEDGE augmentation leads to a degeneration in the resulting graph spectra. Why does GCL with such samples lead to superior representations? While it is clear that the spectral content is not informative in this scenario, what would explain the behavior of contrastive learning? How would this argument relate to existing theoretical frameworks for self-supervised learning (Provable guarantees for self- supervised deep learning with spectral contrastive loss, NeurIPS 2021)?\n+ Does ADDEDGE also lead to similar degenerate spectra? If yes, what can explain the difference in their performance?\n+ The previous questions leads to a more important question. Existing works such as (Analyzing Data-Centric Properties for Graph Contrastive Learning, NeurIPS 2022) have argued that off-the-shelf augmentation strategies can lead to task-irrelevant invariances and sometimes even create erroneous signals (e.g., removing or adding an edge changing the molecule property). How does one ensure that these generic augmentations (e.g., DROPEDGE) are safely used in practice and more importantly, can spectral augmentations provide any complementary benefits. For example, can we use both edge perturbations and spectral augmentations simultaneously?"
