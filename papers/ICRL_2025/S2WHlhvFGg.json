    "abstract": "Predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is essential for advancing drug discovery. This paper presents a unified mathematical framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction, integrating measure theory, functional analysis, information geometry, and optimal transport theory. We introduce the novel concept of DTI-Wasserstein distance, incorporating both structural and chemical similarities of drugs and targets, and establish a refined bound on the difference between source and target risks. Our information-geometric perspective reveals the intrinsic structure of the DTI model space, characterizing optimal adaptation paths as geodesics on a statistical manifold equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric. We develop a spectral decomposition of the DTI-DA transfer operator, providing insights into the modes of information transfer between domains. This leads to the introduction of DTI-spectral embedding and DTI-spectral mutual information, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the adaptation process. Theoretical contributions include refined bounds on DTI-DA performance, incorporating task-specific considerations and spectral properties of the feature space. We prove the existence of an optimal transport map for DTI-DA and derive a novel information-theoretic lower bound using DTI-mutual information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to effectively leverage data from diverse sources for improved DTI prediction.",

                "value": "The paper is a bit confusing. While the mathematical framework is deeply developed, the description of the experiments lacks important details. Additionally, there are confusing statements over the whole paper (see questions below). \n\nThe work uses overly enthusiastic words for very minors improvements, this should be thoroughly revised. For example: \"The results presented in Table 2 indicate that our approach performs exceptionally well across all datasets,\" where the exceptionally well refer to improvements of 0.28% or 3.3%... Also, I guess the authors meant Figure 2 rather than Table 2 as there is no Table 2....\n\nThe work lacks a thorough state-of-the-art review, and it performs similarly to the random forest baseline. In recent DTI papers it has been shown that they clearly improve upon RF, so this work should compare against such works (Moltrans, GeNNius, HyperAttanetioDTI, etc.).  These works has shown to perform very well on uncovering novel DTIs from large datasets. Authors should consider performing these analysis, as without this assessment one cannot evaluate the improvements brought by the proposed DTI mathematical framework."

It would be beneficial if the authors could explain their rationale for choosing these specific datasets and discuss whether they considered using larger, more challenging datasets, such as PDBbind, BindingDB, and KIBA. This would provide valuable insight into their dataset selection process and the potential for expanding their evaluation.\n- In addition to the methods compared in the paper, comparison with more recent state-of-the-art models [1,2,3,4] is recommended. Could the authors explain their rationale for choosing the current baselines and why recent models were excluded from the experimental design? Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of the latest models on the same dataset; if a direct comparison is challenging, a discussion on how these recent models might better predict DTI based on model structure would be valuable.\n- While the theoretical framework is well-defined, the paper could benefit from more practical insights into the model's implementation, such as an analysis of the model's time complexity and memory requirements. Additionally, a discussion on how the proposed model can be scaled for large and complex datasets would provide valuable insights into its applicability beyond controlled benchmarks.\n- Although benchmark performance is discussed, the model's performance in terms of interpretability and its utility in real-world applications are not fully addressed, which may limit the paper's impact on practical DTI applications that require more than predictive accuracy. It would be beneficial to include a case study analyzing which specific characteristics of DTI the model captures to improve predictive performance, providing further insights into its practical applicability and interpretability.\n\n[1] Zhang, Zuolong, et al. \"Enhancing generalizability and performance in drug\u2013target interaction identification by integrating pharmacophore and pre-trained models.\" Bioinformatics 40.Supplement_1 (2024): i539-i547.\n\n[2] Ahmed, Khandakar Tanvir, Md Istiaq Ansari, and Wei Zhang. \"DTI-LM: language model powered drug\u2013target interaction prediction.\" Bioinformatics 40.9 (2024): btae533.\n\n[3] He, Haohuai, Guanxing Chen, and Calvin Yu-Chian Chen. \"NHGNN-DTA: a node-adaptive hybrid graph neural network for interpretable drug\u2013target binding affinity prediction.\" Bioinformatics 39.6 (2023): btad355.\n\n[4] Zhang, Qi, et al. \"FMCA-DTI: A Fragment-oriented method based on a Multihead Cross Attention mechanism to improve Drug-Target Interaction prediction.\" Bioinformatics (2024): btae347."

Please clarify which datasets are the authors using on every section.\n\n4 - I believe it is essential to conduct domain-adaptation analysis by utilizing training and testing folds across different datasets. Is that what the authors did? The statement \"The datasets were randomly divided into source domain and target domain in a 6:4 ratio. Subsequently, the target domain dataset was further split into target train and target test datasets in a 3:1 ratio.\" could be futher clarified with an associated figure.\n\n5 - Is the derived DTI-DA framework applicable to any DTI prediction model? It would be interesting to see if the benchmarked models also benefit from this."
