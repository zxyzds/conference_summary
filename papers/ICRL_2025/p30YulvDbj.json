    "title": "OPTIMIZED SINGLE EEG CHANNEL SELECTION FOR DETECTING MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER",
    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) or depression is a chronic mental illness that significantly impacts individuals' well-being and is often diagnosed at advanced stages, increasing the risk of suicide. Current diagnostic practices, which rely heavily on subjective assessments and patient self-reports, are often hindered by challenges such as under-reporting and the failure to detect early, subtle symptoms. Early detection of MDD is crucial and requires monitoring vital signs in everyday living conditions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable tool for monitoring brain activity, offering critical insights into MDD and its underlying neurological mechanisms. While traditional EEG systems typically involve multiple channels for recording, making them impractical for home-based monitoring, wearable sensors can effectively capture single-channel EEG data. However, generating meaningful features from this data poses challenges due to the need for specialized domain knowledge and significant computational power, which can hinder real-time processing. To address these issues, our study focuses on developing a deep learning model for the binary classification of MDD using single-channel EEG data. We focused on specific channels from various brain regions, including central (C3), frontal (Fp1), occipital (O1), temporal (T4), and parietal (P3). Our study found that the channels Fp1, C3, and O1 achieved an impressive accuracy of 88\\% when analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Our study highlights the potential of utilizing single-channel EEG data for reliable MDD diagnosis, providing a less intrusive and more convenient wearable solution for mental health assessment.",

The employment of a single EEG channel does not come as exciting or new, and neither is there any evidence of improvements or breakthroughs in model structure or methodology that would enhance the discipline.\n\nNo comparative analysis: The study does not provide any analyses on other EEG-based MDD detection systems that are even more advanced in deep learning or more fundamental based on machine learning algorithms. Such a comparative analysis would enable positioning of the proposed MDD approach within the competitive scientific market and its merits or demerits would be illustrated.\n\nLimited dataset: The finding cannot be said to be fully conclusive since only one dataset was employed. Testing the model against several datasets would add weight to the evidence of the model application in different settings and sociocultural characteristics of the population.\n\nInsufficient performance gains: The paper does not exhibit any significant progresses relative to the three computed parameters such as the model accuracy, computation time, and clinical importance. In the absence of these parameters, the proposed approach does not provide credible case for progress in the field or major contributions in the area of MDD detection."

Such analysis would define if the deep learning model is actually better suited for this task than model architectures that are less complex.\n\nDataset and Generalization: As you employed only one dataset, how sure are you that this particular approach would transfer to other EEG datasets or other patients? Would such an effort lead you to incorporate other datasets or cross-dataset tests?\n\nClinical Relevance and Practicality: In the future, how do you intend the single-channel model to have clinical relevance? Or perhaps you could explain whether you conducted any studies or experiments that would in some way prove its practical effectiveness, especially in diagnostic centers, in terms of performance or efficiency gains?"

Lack of novelty of the model:\nThe paper uses a very generic CNN structure (3 layers of CNNs) without any optimization techniques specifically targeting single channels. \n3.

Meaningless performance listing in the Introduction:\nIn the Introduction, the authors list various competing methods and their accuracies, but this serves no meaningful purpose.
