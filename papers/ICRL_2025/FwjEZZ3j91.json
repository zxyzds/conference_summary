    "title": "Parsing the Language of Expressions: Enhancing Symbolic Regression with Domain-Aware Symbolic Priors",
    "abstract": "Symbolic regression is pivotal for discovering interpretable expressions that unravel complex phenomena by revealing underlying mathematical and physical relationships within data. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced symbolic regression method that integrates symbol priors derived from diverse scientific domains\u2014including physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering\u2014into the regression process. By organizing and analyzing domain-specific expressions, we examine the probability distributions of symbols across different topics. We introduce a novel tree-structured recurrent neural networks (RNNs) infused with these symbol priors to guide the learning process using domain knowledge. In our approach, we introduce a new tree structure to represent expressions, where unary operators connected by the same binary operator are positioned at the same hierarchical level. By analyzing the combinations of symbols at different heights and levels within the tree, we are able to examine symbol priors across the entire hierarchical structure. This effectively incorporates the structural information of expressions into the regression process. Additionally, we compile characteristic expression blocks from each domain and incorporate them into the operator dictionary during training, expediting learning by providing relevant building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating symbol priors significantly boosts the performance of symbolic regression methods. Specifically, it accelerates the efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms in obtaining optimal policies. Our findings confirm that leveraging domain-specific symbol priors not only hastens convergence but also yields more accurate and interpretable models, effectively bridging the gap between data-driven learning and expert expertise in symbolic regression.",

First and foremost, the abstract is written in such a way that it is hard to tease apart the core contributions from the tangential ones: the authors claim to have developed tree-structured RNNs, a novel way to represent mathematical expressions using n-ary expression trees, integrating prior knowledge into symbolic regression, but it's not clear (to me) how they relate to each other. Furthermore, figures which were presumable included to aid with intuition are presented with single line captions, and not much else.\n\n- In terms of contributions, to my knowledge Tree-RNNs are not a novel contribution [1]. It is also not clear to me why the authors' second contribution, n-ary expression trees are beneficial in the context of symbolic-regression, or in general. The authors only mention that most collected expressions can be represented using a two-level tree structure. Why is that beneficial?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417420310435"

SRBench contains a diverse set of problems from scientific domains, including physics (119 Feynman equations) and fluid dynamics (14 Strogatz ODEs), making it particularly relevant for testing domain-specific priors. Without results on these established problems, it's difficult to assess how the proposed method compares against recent approaches that have already demonstrated strong performance on SRBench. Given that many SRBench problems align well with the domains from which the authors extract priors, these benchmarks would provide a more convincing validation of the method's effectiveness.\n\n* A key concern is the potential overlap between the extracted domain priors and the target equations. The paper doesn't explain how they prevent information leakage. The authors should clearly describe their protocol for ensuring independence between their knowledge base and test cases, and specify how their four test datasets relate to the extracted priors.\n\n* The paper lacks a formal analysis of why the tree-structure RNN leads to better performance\n\n* The sensitivity of the method to the quality of extracted priors needs more detailed analysis. How robust is the method to noisy or incorrect priors?"

A well known limitation of symbolic regressionmay be overly dependent on well-chosen priors, potentially reducing its generalizability to domains with less structured or known symbol patterns. To address this, the authors could explore more adaptive techniques for generating priors or mitigate the risks of bias through uncertainty modeling or data-driven prior refinement. Overall I found the paper pretty preliminary and not sure how does it compare to other competitive baselines like GNNs.\n\nAs the focus of the paper is Symbolic Regression (SR), any vanilla baseline on SR should be included.\n\nthe paper can improve in clarity by providing additional details and illustrative examples of how specific priors affect the learning process.\n\nthe font size of diagrams and plots are too small to read. \n\nsome notations like \u201dbehavior prior\u201d is incorrectly compiled via latex"
