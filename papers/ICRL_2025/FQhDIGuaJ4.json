    "abstract": "Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions.\nIn this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities.\nWDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes including 1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 33.2% compared to the second-best baseline.",

                "value": "Aiming at improving the performance of diffusion generative models, in particular for cases with abrupt changes, the authors propose to construct such diffusion models in the wavelet space. To reduce the solution manifold that the model needs to learn and therefore to ease super-resolution, the authors propose to scale the systems such that they align spatio-temporally, and additionally propose to train the model at multiple scales. The resulting model over-performs the state-of-the-art baselines in various simulation and control tasks."

                "value": "The most significant weakness point of the work is the small number of temporal steps in all the test cases, which might actually be one of the limitation of these models, since the usual approach adopted to achieve long roll-out inference without instability is to introduce artificial training noise - it might be difficult to do so when one is already training a denoising model. It should be noted that the authors iteratively try to strengthen the point that they are doing \"long-term dynamics\" in the temproal domain, but their reported cases, e.g., the 2D incompressive fluid case, only consist 32 time steps each, which in the commonsense definition is quite a short forecasting window. I strongly suggest removing such terms from the paper to avoid confusion for future readers of the work."

The method is tested with several fluid dynamic problems such as 1D Bruger's equaion, 1D and 2D Navier-Stokes in both simulation and control tasks."

But that is not a big issue as long as the model performance is good. \n\n- The motivation for using diffusion models for PDE learning is not well established. This paper mentions that diffusion models can better capture long-term predictions and model high-dimensional systems. However, many deep learning-based models can do both, such as Fourier neural operators. How do diffusion models differentiate from other deep learning-based models? Also, can you provide a reference paper that shows diffusion models can do a better job of capturing long-term predictions?\n\n- I have some concerns about the datasets used in this paper. 1D Burgers with a viscosity of 0.01 is not particularly challenging, though it presents shock wave phenomena. The standard physics-informed neural networks [1] are also capable of handling such tasks. The authors may consider some other challenging datasets, such as ERA5 [2], since the proposed method can deal with long-term predictions. Second, it would also be interesting to see the model performance on the dynamics without abrupt changes. I think that will also give the audience a broader sense of how this model works. The authors may consider some datasets in PDEBench [3].\n\n- It would be good to have another ablation study on the DDPM + Fourier transform, which changes the wavelet transform in the proposed method. The additional experiment will be trained in Fourier space instead of wavelet space. It will further validate the effectiveness of using wavelet transform to capture local details. \n\n- The presentation for Section 2 Related Work can be improved. It would be better to have several paragraphs to introduce the related works from different perspectives.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Raissi, M., Perdikaris, P., & Karniadakis, G. E. (2019).

Expanding the range of test cases would enhance the generalizability of the results:\n1. An analysis of the error distribution over time would be valuable, as it could reveal any systematic errors or trends in performance decay over extended simulations.\n2. Lack of a real-world test case. Please include a real-world test case to provide further validation of the approach in practical settings:  a dataset like PTB-XL should be addressable with the proposed method and could offer relevant, real-world complexity.\n3. Additional 2D cases across a broader range of complex spatial-temporal domains would strengthen the  work. [Iakolev et al, Latent neural ODEs with sparse bayesian multiple shooting, ICLR 2023, Lagemann et al, Invariance-based Learning of Latent Dynamics, ICLR 2024] are presenting results for 2D PDE-based test cases. It makes also sense to compare WDNO against these neural ODE based approaches for the simulation part. \n\nFigures 1 and 2 could be improved for clarity and relevance. \nIn my opinion Figure 1 lacks meaningful content and could be more effectively repurposed. The caption offers minimal context, leaving the figure\u2019s purpose unclear, especially as the main text already conveys WDNO\u2019s super-resolution capabilities. Reallocating this space to highlight other aspects of the method might provide more value.\nFigure 2 is informative and well-designed but would benefit from an expanded caption to guide readers through its details, despite space constraints. I would suggest a more general, high-level version of this figure in the main text and the current version of Figure 2 with a detailed caption in the Appendix. This would offer both an accessible overview and a richer, in-depth explanation in the Appendix.\nA detailed explanation tracing the steps from input data to output data of the pipeline and the transformations involved in each stage, with explicit dimensions based on one of the datasets would be great and improve the clarity. \n\nIn my opinion, eq. 9 and 10 appear not important in the main discussion and could be more appropriately relocated to the corresponding Appendix (E, F, G). Instead, a general paragraph on data preparation in the main text would provide readers with a clearer understanding of the processes involved, which is currently lacking.\n\nAdditionally, the work presented in Appendix C is noteworthy and should at least be mentioned briefly in the main text. \n\nPlease reorganize the Appendix to ensure that tables are placed immediately after they are referenced. As there is no page limit for the Appendix, there is no need to conserve space, which would increase the readability. \n\nPlease add an arrow indicating the direction of time on the time axis in Figure 4."
