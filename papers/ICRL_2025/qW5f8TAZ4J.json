    "title": "FairSkin: Fair Diffusion for Skin Disease Image Geneartion",
    "abstract": "Image generation is a prevailing technique for clinical data augmentation for advancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing healthcare disparities. Diffusion Model (DM) has become a leading method in generating synthetic medical images, but it suffers from a critical twofold bias: (1)The quality of images generated for Caucasian individuals is significantly higher, as measured by the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID). (2)The ability of the downstream-task learner to learn critical features from disease images varies across different skin tones. These biases pose significant risks, particularly in skin disease detection, where underrepresentation of certain skin tones can lead to misdiagnosis or neglect of specific conditions. To address these challenges, we propose FairSkin, a novel DM framework that mitigates these biases through a three-level resampling mechanism, ensuring fairer representation across racial and disease categories. Our approach significantly improves the diversity and quality of generated images, contributing to more equitable skin disease detection in clinical settings.",

                "value": "The paper's primary objective is to balance fairness and model performance during the development of a generative model that generates the skin disease image conditioned on both race and disease classes. To mitigate the identified imbalances, they propose the FairSkin framework, which integrates balanced sampling strategies and class diversity loss within a diffusion model. They also consider two downstream balancing techniques, imbalance-aware augmentation, and dynamic reweighing, to address the performance-fairness trade-off."

A more robust approach would involve a fine-grained control of skin tone, potentially incorporating established skin tone scales such as  the Fitzpatrick or Monk scales.\n- The evaluation protocol's reliance on FID and Inception-based scores may not be appropriate in this context. While monitoring the generation performance of synthetic data is essential, utilizing these metrics as quality indicators is questionable, mainly because the Inception Score is based on ImageNet statistics, which may not be relevant to the datasets employed in this study.\n- The paper raises concerns regarding dataset imbalance. However, it employs standard accuracy rather than a balanced accuracy metric, which could lead to skewed performance assessments, especially in imbalanced datasets. Balanced accuracy metric would provide a fairer evaluation of the model\u2019s performance across underrepresented classes.\n- The experimental protocol could also be enhanced by including additional datasets beyond Fitzpatrick17. Expanding the dataset selection would improve the generalizability of the findings. See some suggestions in the section below."

The figure would help readers better navigate the paper and provide rapid reference across sections.\n- In addition to Fitzpatrick17, several datasets with annotated skin tone information could enhance the study\u2019s experimental scope. Suggestions Slice-3D [1], Casual Conversations [2], and FACET [3], each of which provides extensive metadata that could help to better condition image generation and studies about the impact of meta-data available with the image generation quality. With access to more datasets, a cross-dataset transfer evaluation could also be considered. This approach would involve training a diffusion model on one or more datasets and generating new data for a target dataset excluded from the training process, enabling exploration of the model\u2019s generalization capabilities and potential for transfer learning.\n- Investigate other fairness metrics, such as equal opportunity and disparate impact. Others, such as worst group statistics used in domain generalization, appear to be a great addition here.\n- The results section lacks a comparative analysis with SOTA methods, particularly those designed to address imbalanced datasets. Table 1 should include comparisons with SOTA methods that deal with imbalance-related challenges. Works referenced in [1,2,3,4] may provide valuable benchmarks and ensure a more comprehensive evaluation.\n- \"Image Geneartion\" -> \"Image Generation\" in the paper's title?"

                "value": "The authors do not mention how the \"racial groups\": Caucasian, Asian, and African are created from the Fitzpatrick17k dataset, since the dataset only contains Fitzpatrick skin tone (FST) labels. It appears that the authors make a huge leap of assumption by mapping FST labels to \"race\" thus conflating skin tone with race, but this assumption is scientifically incorrect and should be flagged for an ethics review. FST was originally proposed to describe the propensity of the skin to burn from UV light exposure, and should not be conflated with race or ethnicity [1], with Fitzpatrick himself stating that \"ethinicity or \"race\" is only a cultural and political term with no scientific basis\" [2]. For example, a study of 556 participants from South Africa showed the presence of all 6 FST labels [3], invalidating that assumption that Africans can be limited to only some FSTs.\n\nThis paper fails to cite a number of papers from the existing literature that deal with similar topics: skin lesion image synthesis for fairer diagnosis [5, 6] and a larger body of literature on dealing with fairer diagnosis methods for dermatology [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\n\nThe demographic parity (DP) metric used to assess fairness is limited to scenarios where there are only 2 demographic groups [4]. Metrics such as the normalized accuracy range (NAR) [5] have been proposed to deal with scenarios with multiple groups.\n\nUsing the DP metric also \"requires equal proportion of positive predictions in each group\" [4], which is not the case with this work as shown in Table 4.\n\nThere is no comparison with other competing methods (e.g. [5,6]).\n\nWhy is the schematic of Fig 1 (in the lower right bar chart) showing the accuracy of African diminished in the blue after? I think you need to swap African with Caucasian.  But even then, is this schematic making the point that improving fairness has to come at the expense of lower accuracy for some groups?\n\nL056-058: How is the \"balanced\" in point (1) different from the \"fairly represented\" in point (2)?\n\nL151: Having Nr1 \\neq Nr2 as the mathematical definition for imbalance seems too structured, e.g. if there 1000 images of light skin and 1001 of dark skin, I don't agree to declaring the data as biased because 1000 \\neq 1001.\n\nL171: resampling inversely proportional to frequency is a standard approach.\n\nL171 and L181: 1/N vs 1/sqrt(N) is a trivial point not worthy, in reviewer's opinion, of have two sections to cover them. You could have written: W = N^p, where p = -1 , -1/2 , etc.\n\nL204: Mode collapse is only mentioned here without any explanation or introduction.\n\nL206: The authors write \"we introduce CBDM\" but then write that this approach of using class diversity loss Lr is existing work. So what is novel here? Is it only the application to skin? This must be clarified in the writing.\n\nL215: How can calculating the subtraction between two noise signals be a robust measure given the randomness of the noise;  why isn't a statistical measure of the noise used instead, e.g.,  Lr = abs ( variance ( noise for class y )   minus  variance ( noise for class y' ) ).\n\nL270: justify why a pre-trained network on non skin images should be used to measure FID for skin images?\n\nL276:  justify why \"IS\" is a suitable quality metric specifically for skin images?\n\nL323:   \"Vanilla\" is not described. \n\nThe equations should be numbered.\n\n[1] O.

                "value": "This paper falls between a methodological paper and an application paper. \nFor a methods paper, the individual methods (balanced sampling methods and losses) are either reused from other papers, or not substantial enough.\nIf we consider the whole framework as a creative combination of those methods, there are still problems: There is hardly any comparison to work by other authors, and the whole analysis is conducted on a single dataset. \nFor an applications paper I would also expect the use of more than one dataset, more (fairness) metrics and a deeper discussion of the clinical relevance of the findings.\nThe very thing the paper tries to solve also very much impedes it's impact: The scarcity of darker skin types in the dataset leads to a small test set und thus results from which it is unclear whether they generalise well. I encourage the authors to think about using additional attributes to repeat and strenghten their analysis (e.g. using FairSkin on age/gender and seeing whether the results still hold).\n\nA more detailed list of issues:\n 1) The main claim of the paper is that it improves fairness by balancing out the lack of high quality training data of darker skin-types in the dataset. But the results in Fig 4 show that the accuracy increases for 'Caucasian' and decreases for 'Asian' and 'African' compared to the vanilla approach. So either I misunderstand something fundamentally, or the validation/test set is way too small to be representative, or this paper achieves the opposite of what it tries to do.\n 2) Much of the analysis hinges on how the method does on the most underrepresented data group, which according to table 4, is 'African'. Given that the smallest disease subgroup only contains 12 examples and a 8:1:1 train/val/test split, some of the analysis is done on 1-2 datapoints. I would expect repetitions of results using different hold out sets to mitigate against this very low number.\n 3) A repetition of (part of) the analysis on a different dataset would make this paper much stronger. There is e.g. the scin dataset, which also contains Fitzpatrick labels: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/scin\n 4) A tabular ablation study would be really helpful to decide which of the components are actually making a difference. The current solution with FairSkin-XYC is hard to parse and read and I had to skip back and forth numerous times.\n 5) Many of the claims in the conclusion are weekly supported by the experimental results:\n *  A):\"Our approach effectively enhances the overall\nquality of generated images while reducing disparities in image generation quality across different\nclasses.\" The overall quality as measures by IS and FID scores stays practiacally the same, and is worse than the baseline CBDM. But I agree with the second half of the statement.\n * B) \"we address the challenge of balancing fairness and performance in image generation\nand downstream classifier tasks\" There is the compound ESSP score, but for example table 1 lacks an accuracy score altogether. There is also little discussion on how the balance the two objectives.\n * C) ...\" tasks when dealing with long-tailed datasets [plural!] through FairSkin.\" But the paper only deals with one single dataset, and apparently only with a fixed datasplit within that dataset. The results would be much stronger if the framework was tested on different datasets too, even synthetic ones, or at least multiple ways to hold out data in the splits.\nCBDM\n* D) \"Furthermore, it improves the fairness of downstream classifiers when using generated images for data augmentation\" While the paper demonstrates an improvement in the Demographic Parity metric, it actually decreases downstream performance (fig 4) of the skin type classes with less images in the original training data. It makes me wonder whether DP is the appropriate fairness metric in this case. The paper lacks a discussion of why DP was chosen as the only fairness metric. Why did you e.g. not report equalized odds? Consider reporting more metrics and more results on a skin type and disease stratified level (in the appendix).\n * E) \"Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements across various tasks\" The validation accuracy stays practically the same. DP and FID variance improve, but again 8D) is this even meaningful when it seems to decrease performance of classes with least training data?\n * F) \"Highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of our methods in\nreal-world applications.\" There is no discussion in the paper on how this could be practical or effective in real-world applications. Such a claim would at the very least require use test-data from a different dataset. Or an analysis on most-confounded disease classes to look at potential real-world harm of misclassifications.\n6) I would have appreciated a deeper analysis stratified by disease to see how the method fares for diseases with more or less training data (for individual/all skin type classes)\n7) There is very little discussion in the introduction and elsewhere about fairness in ML literature.\n\n\nA general remark: \n* The paper indiscriminately uses the words racial/ethnic/demographic classes when referring to the above labels. Race, ethnicity, and demographic, are a) not synonyms and b) not covered by the Fitzpatrick scale. The Fitzpatrick scale measures skin type (how much tanning occurs under UV exposure)."

This is a) not very informative and b) makes me wonder whether thanks to the small test-set and single repetion of experiments the results are only anectodal. Could you clarify what you were trying to express with these ablations and how one should choose the number of augmentations in practice?\n4) In table 1, it is unclear which sampling strategy is used for FairSkin, is it CBRS or SQRS?"
