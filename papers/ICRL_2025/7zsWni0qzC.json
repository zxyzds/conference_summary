    "title": "Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations",
    "abstract": "Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Numerous methods have been proposed to infer a directed acyclic graph (DAG) corresponding to the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN) that captures causal gene relationships. However, existing models have restrictive assumptions (e.g. linearity, acyclicity), limited scalability, and/or fail to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.",

                "value": "This paper introduces PerturbODE, a novel framework that uses neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell perturbation data. PerturbODE addresses limitations of existing causal graph discovery methods by (i) incorporating biologically-informed ODEs to model cell state trajectories under perturbations, (ii) does estimation in a latent space and (iii) derive GRNs from the ODE parameters by aligning latent and input space. The method can capture non-linear and cyclic gene interactions, which is an advantage over many existing methods and maps cell states to a lower-dimensional \"gene module\" space, which provides high-level insights into the system. Experiments on simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets show PerturbODE outperforms existing methods in GRN inference and prediction tasks. The authors demonstrate PerturbODE's ability to recover biologically meaningful network structures like negative autoregulation."

The authors propose a novel method based on neural ODEs that incorporates biologically informed dynamics to address both problems. PerturbODE has three key strengths that work towards addressing these longstanding problems in the computational biology community:\n\n1. GRN inference over high-dimensional systems is a challenging task. The authors demonstrate that their novel method, PerturbODE, is able to learn GRNs for high-dimensional systems. \n2. A challenging problem in trajectory inference of cells is predicting the response of cellular systems under unseen interventions/perturbations. The authors show that PerturbODE is able to achieve improved performance on this task relative to counterpart baselines.\n3. PerturbODE is able to model and learn cyclic dependencies, pertinent to GRN inference."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Although this paper works towards addressing important and challenging problems of GRN inference and cell response prediction, there remain several shortcomings that limit the contributions of this paper (see below).\n\n- If one of the claims is that PerturbODE can model cyclic dependencies between variables (genes), why evaluate on systems where the data generative processes adhere from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)? If I understand correctly, SERGIO is limited to simulating systems given a DAG representation of a GRN. In this case, it may be useful to consider other biological system simulation tools in addition to SERGIO, for example, the framework in [1] could be used. At the minimum, this can be done in smaller systems (10-100 genes) to empirically validate the claims that PerturbODE can model cyclic dependencies. \n- Likewise, for results on GRN inference on the transcription factor (TF) atlas, it is not clear if the ground truth GRNs are DAGs or contain cycles. In 4.2.2, the authors discuss that PerturbODE is able to predict negative feedback loops. However, in Appendix 6.7, the ground truth GRNs which are used for evaluation on the TF atlas (shown in Figures 15, 16, and 17), appear to be acyclic. It is not clear how the assessment of PerturbODE's ability to learn cyclic dependencies in GRNs is accomplished in this section. Further explanation and details are required to convey the significance of this result (and likewise this contribution).\n- This work focuses on the task of GRN inference from interventional data. However, only a select few baseline methods are considered and compared. There exist many methods specifically tailored for GRN inference. To give a few examples, I refer the authors to [1]. I think it is okay if other GRN inference methods are not included, but it would be beneficial to include some discussion and justification on why the baselines considered in this work are sufficient for fair evaluation. \n- For experiments in 4.2.1 for predicting response on held-out interventions. The authors compare only to baselines that are not necessarily tailored for this task. There exist state-of-the-art methods that address this problem, for example [2, 3]. To effectively showcase the utility of PerturbODE, it would be beneficial to compare to an existing method designed for predicting response to perturbations in biological systems since the NOTEARS baselines are not designed for this task. Without a biological-specific baseline for predicting response to perturbations, it is difficult to assess how PerturbODE performs relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it would be helpful to include a baseline that does not learn a GRN and is just trained to predict the perturbational response. Such a method should not work in the setting of unseen interventions since it will never see those conditions, but can be informative of whether or not learning the GRN is actually beneficial for this task. \n\nIn general, there are still various details missing regarding experimental details, empirical validation of discovered GRNs, and justification of design choices of the method (see questions below). This makes the paper somewhat incomplete and hinders the presentation of the method and results. I think if these items are addressed, it would improve the overall quality of the paper."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Lines 245 - 246: Beyond use for benchmarking, what is the justification of classifying negative edges as non-existing edges? Why not take the absolute value over $\\mathbf{W}$ and consider all edges as positive edges? \n- The authors state that the structural hamming distance (SHD) metric would strongly favour predictions of empty graphs due to sparsity of ground truth GRNs (Lines 318 - 320). Do the methods tend to return empty graphs such that this would be the case? If the methods do return empty graphs, would this not be reflected in the other metrics, while still getting a performance metric through SHD that gives some global view on how the methods perform on predicting the GRN graph.\n- For the experiments in 4.1 and 4.2, why not compute other additional metrics? For instance, given that the data has intervention, the negative log-likelihood of data points under intervention (I-NLL, done in DCDFG) could be computed. Possibly area under the ROC (AUROC) could also be computed to give an additional view of the results.\n- In Figures 2 and 4, what are the mean and std for box plots computed over? Different graphs? \n- For performance evaluation, the authors threshold $\\mathbf{W}$ to construct a binary adjacency matrix so that the evaluation metrics can be computed. This is done by selecting some small value $\\epsilon$ and setting edge weights below $\\epsilon$ to $0$ and above $\\epsilon$ to $1$. The determination of $\\epsilon$ depends on a parameter $c$. This seems like a limiting factor in the sense that as $c$ is changed, performance may change\n    - How do you decide the value of $c$? Is this value determined via SERGIO? \n    - Is this treated as a settable parameter? If so, how would the results change as the value of $c$ is changed?\n- On the SERGIO simulated data the authors claim that PeturbODE gives significantly higher precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to DCDFG, NOTEARS, and NOTEARS-LR, while comparable scores DCDI, especially in the high dimensional case (400 genes). Compared to DCDI, it appears PerturbODE also yields a significantly higher variance on Recall and F1 score, while performing overall worse on precision. Is there intuition as to why PerturbODE yields such a high variance on Recall? I assume since there is variance on recall, this leads to variance on F1 score as well.\n- For the task of predicting the response of unseen interventions (In Table 1) is there intuition as to why PerturbODE performs worse on the 2-Wasserstein metric, but significantly better on Pearson correlation? In general, this is a very difficult task. It could help to observe how the numbers for these metrics look for seen interventions (see earlier question regarding Interventional-NLL).\n- For the result presented In Figure 4, the authors state GRN inference is done for a system of 817 genes. But the ground truth GRNs shown in Appendix 6.7 have far less genes. Are the GRNs shown in Appendix 6.7 Figures 15, 16, and 17 only the non-zero edges in the ground truth GRNs? \n- If the objective is to learn a flow map for pushing initial samples over time (eq 3), why not use the recent advances in flow matching [4], which can achieve the same result in a significantly more efficient manner using simulation-free training, compared to Neural ODEs? This could potentially enable further scaling. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Pratapa, Aditya, et al. \"Benchmarking algorithms for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data.\" Nature methods 17.2 (2020): 147-154.\n\n[2] Lotfollahi, Mohammad, et al. \"Predicting cellular responses to complex perturbations in high\u2010throughput screens.\" Molecular systems biology 19.6 (2023): e11517.\n\n[3] Roohani, Yusuf, Kexin Huang, and Jure Leskovec. \"Predicting transcriptional outcomes of novel multigene perturbations with GEARS.\" Nature Biotechnology 42.6 (2024): 927-935.\n\n[4] Lipman, Yaron, et al. \"Flow Matching for Generative Modeling.\" International Conference on Learning Representations.

In the experimental phase, the paper primarily presents metric-based results, showing that the method outperforms others.

For a biological application, simply comparing metrics does not sufficiently demonstrate the model\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n4.

Furthermore, the study would benefit from incorporating a larger number of real life datasets and baselines. See detailed comments below.\n\n- There is a large discrepancy in the number of selected edges between PerturbODE and the baselines for the atlas TF dataset (103,941 for PerturbODE and fewer than 500 for NO-TEARS and NO-TEARS-LR). It is not clear how meaningful the reported recall scores are given such discrepancy. Tuning parameters to select more edges in the baselines or including other baselines from causality literature [1-2] is necessary to provide a more accurate comparison.\n- The total number of genes used in the TF atlas is 817, for a total of 667,489 possible edges. Selecting 100k from these (around 1/6) will likely inflate recall scores and, furthermore, is not very biologically plausible (you would expect around 3 interactions per gene on average [3]).\n- Only one real experimental dataset is used (TF atlas) in the benchmark. Incorporating other datasets (e.g., from drug treatment, environmental stress) is necessary to support the claims made in this paper.\n- The analysis is largely performed on edges and gene modules. More biological validation, e.g., gene enrichment analysis of top regulated genes, would enhance the biological validity of the model.\n- Comparing against established methods for (non-causal) GRN inference (e.g., from the BEELINE benchmark [4]) would help the reader determine the utility of such causal models.\n- Other methods have proposed neural ODEs for GRN inference [5].
