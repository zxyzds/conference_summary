    "title": "PIN: Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function-based Implicit Neural Representations",
    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a continuous mapping between the coordinates of a signal and the corresponding values. As the performance of INRs heavily depends on the choice of nonlinear-activation functions, there has been a significant focus on encoding explicit signals within INRs using diverse activation functions. Despite recent advancements, existing INRs often encounter significant challenges, particularly at fine scales where they often introduce noise-like artifacts over smoother areas compromising the quality of the output. Moreover, they frequently struggle to generalize to unseen coordinates. These drawbacks highlight a critical area for further research and development to enhance the robustness and applicability of INRs across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce the Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function-based Implicit Neural Representations (PIN), which exploits the optimal space-frequency domain concentration of Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) as the nonlinear mechanism in INRs. Our experimental results reveal that PIN excels not only in representing images and 3D shapes but also significantly outperforms existing methods in various vision tasks that require INR generalization, including image inpainting, novel view synthesis, edge detection, and image denoising.",

The authors demonstrate improvements through experiments on various tasks, including image regression, neural radiance fields, and so on."

The experiments in tasks, such as Occupancy Field Representation and Neural Radiance Field, appear to be conducted on a subset of the entire dataset, which may undermine the persuasiveness of the results.\n3.

I observed that a bandwidth parameter \\(c\\) governs the frequency. Could you provide guidance on how to select this parameter effectively?
