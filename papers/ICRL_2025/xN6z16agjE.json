    "title": "Evaluating word representation for hypernymy relation: with focus on Arabic",
    "abstract": "Hypernymy relation is one of the fundamental relations for many natural language processing and information extraction tasks. A key component of the performance of any hypernymy-related task is word representation. Traditional word embeddings capture word similarity but fall short of representing more complex lexical-semantic relationships between terms, such as hypernymy. To overcome this, recent studies have proposed hypernymy-specific representations. In this study, we conduct an evaluation of several types of word representations to determine the most effective approach for modeling hypernymy relationships in Arabic. We use an Arabic training corpus and several datasets to assess traditional embedding, hypernymy-specific embedding, and contextual embedding across several hypernymy-related tasks, including hypernymy detection. The results indicate that different embeddings have different effects on the performance. Moreover, the performance is affected by the selected datasets. This highlights that there is a need for further research to develop more robust word representation and benchmark datasets.",

                "value": "Authors try to evaluate different algorithms, which create hypernymy relation representations in Arabic. They select AraBERT corpus as a base for training all embedding models and train several models on this data. As a baseline for contextual embeddings, BERT is used, while for classic embeddings GloVe is used. For hypernymy-specific embedding LEAR, GLEN, Princare and Poincare Glove is used. After that, a simple feedforward models are trained for all embeddings for three tasks: hypernymy detection, hypernymy directionality detection and semantic relation classification. Results show, that Poincare GloVe performs best on hypernomy detection and hypernomy directionality detection tasks. In semantic relation classification tasks Poincare GloVe performs worse. Overall, there is no best representation for all tasks."

                "value": "1. The goal of the paper is easy to understand, as it provides valuable insight into which representations are best for hypernym-based tasks (none are best overall)\n\n2. Experiment design makes sense and is mostly without issues. There is a minor issue stemming from the limited resources available to the authors of the paper, but I will touch upon them in the weaknesses part of the review."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Authors are very constrained in resources, having to resort to halving the size of the training dataset for some of the algorithms. This raises questions to the validity of the collected information, since Poincare GloVe, the best algorithm in Hypernymy Directionality and Hypernymy Detection tasks, has seen only half as many data samples, which can possibly make the results non-representative. However, due to the simplicity of the Poincare GloVe, most likely it won\u2019t impact the results as much, thus, making this just a minor issue.\n\n2. The quality of the text's presentation is poor; it contains numerous typos and improperly formatted tables. Table 7 has incorrectly formatted items in header, Table 8 has incorrectly formatted dataset names, in table 7 the highest F1 score for ASRD dataset is incorrectly attributed to 100D Poincare GloVe, which has the score of 0.88 instead of Poincare Embedding, which have the score of 0.89. On the line 070 BERT has no citation available, on the line 220 the sentence starts from lowercase, on the line 291 the word Assess is incorrectly capitalized, line 480 is cut in half, etc. Both Introduction and Related Work sections are hard to read, since they are written in a big wall of text instead of separate paragraphs on groups of algorithms. Some of the citation years are in brackets (lines 065-068), some are not (line 079)."
