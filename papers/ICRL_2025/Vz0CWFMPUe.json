    "title": "TimeInf: Time Series Data Contribution via Influence Functions",
    "abstract": "Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.",

                "value": "1. Compared to existing methods, the advantages of this approach are not fully emphasized, and the innovative aspects are not clearly defined. The main contribution of the paper can be seen as an extension of existing theory, but the method primarily involves deriving formulas based on Equation (3) and considering the Mixture of \\( \\delta z^{[m]} \\). This operation has limited significance for theoretical extension and does not effectively demonstrate the contribution claimed. I do not believe it addresses the shortcomings of existing methods.\n2. The paper conducts experiments on anomaly detection, interpretability, and mislabeled error in datasets. However, the paper does not discuss current state-of-the-art baselines in anomaly detection, such as methods based on LLMs or DCdetector. Moreover, the AUC and F1 results differ significantly from the original work. While the authors' skepticism about dataset quality is commendable, more evidence is needed to support this claim, as only partial visualizations of the data are presented. Additionally, the ablation experiments in the appendix are limited to parameter experiments. Based on my experience, complex theoretical methods often perform unsatisfactorily in neural network training, and more evidence is required to validate the effectiveness of the theory.\n3. Compared to traditional machine learning papers, there is no clear and complete process to present the designed algorithm, such as the input, output, and objective function. The majority of the paper is focused on theoretical formulas and related comparisons, making it difficult to understand"

Unlike previous data contribution methods that primarily focus on i.i.d. settings, TimeInf specifically addresses the challenges of temporal dependencies in time series data. The method works by analyzing overlapping blocks of consecutive time points to preserve temporal structure, then uses influence functions to measure how individual time points impact model predictions. TimeInf's key innovation is its ability to integrate data values across consecutive time series observations while accounting for different temporal arrangements of data points. The authors demonstrate TimeInf's effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing it outperforms existing methods in both identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. The method is particularly noteworthy for its computational efficiency, interpretable results through visualizations, and strong performance in practical applications, while being theoretically grounded in robust statistics and autoregressive models."

The method is built on a strong mathematical foundation combining robust statistics with innovative use of overlapping blocks to preserve temporal structure. This theoretical rigor is balanced with practical efficiency, as TimeInf proves to be computationally faster than deep learning alternatives while remaining scalable to large datasets with millions of time points. The method provides clear, quantifiable influence scores and intuitive visualizations that help users understand both anomaly patterns and forecasting behaviors. Its comprehensive evaluation across multiple real-world datasets demonstrates consistent improvement over existing approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Methodological Limitations:\nThe paper\u2019s core claim about their \u201cdistinctive integration\u201d considering various temporal patterns seems to overlap significantly with existing attention mechanisms, without adequately differentiating itself. The theoretical justification for TimeInf lacks rigorous analysis of its properties, such as consistency or asymptotic behavior. Additionally, the paper doesn\u2019t thoroughly explore the sensitivity of TimeInf to various hyperparameters, like block length or model architecture choices.\n\t2.\tExperimental Issues:\nThe experimental setup, particularly for anomaly detection tasks, is not clearly described, making result reproduction challenging. The reported results differ significantly from those in original papers for baseline methods, raising questions about comparison fairness. Important baselines in time series anomaly detection such as MTAD-GAT[1], TransAD[2] are missing, limiting the ability to fully assess TimeInf\u2019s performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.  [1] and [2] are using the unspervised learning to learn the distribution and don't use the \"clean data assumption\" as well. The paper also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of TimeInf\u2019s interpretability claims compared to other approaches.\n\t3.\tLimited Scope and Analysis:\nWhile the paper focuses primarily on anomaly detection tasks, it\u2019s not clear how well TimeInf generalizes to other time series tasks or domains. The computational complexity of TimeInf compared to existing approaches is not thoroughly analyzed, despite mentioning efficiency improvements through conjugate gradient and Hessian-free approaches. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of TimeInf\u2019s limitations or potential failure cases, which is crucial for understanding when and where the method is most applicable. Lastly, the evaluation metrics used are standard (AUC and F1 score), but don\u2019t consider other potentially relevant metrics for time series anomaly detection, such as detection delay or false positive rate at a fixed detection threshold.\n\n\n[1] Zhao, Hang, et al. \"Multivariate time-series anomaly detection via graph attention network.\" 2020 IEEE international conference on data mining (ICDM).
