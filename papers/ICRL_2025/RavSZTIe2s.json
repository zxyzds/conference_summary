    "title": "Shape as Line Segments: Accurate and Flexible Implicit Surface Representation",
    "abstract": "Distance field-based implicit representations like signed/unsigned distance fields have recently gained prominence in geometry modeling and analysis. However, these distance fields are reliant on the closest distance of points to the surface, introducing inaccuracies when interpolating along cube edges during surface extraction. Additionally, their gradients are ill-defined at certain locations, causing distortions in the extracted surfaces. To address this limitation, we propose Shape as Line Segments (SALS), an accurate and efficient implicit geometry representation based on attributed line segments, which can handle arbitrary structures. Unlike previous approaches, SALS leverages a differentiable Line Segment Field to implicitly capture the spatial relationship between line segments and the surface. Each line segment is associated with two key attributes, intersection flag and ratio, from which we propose edge-based dual contouring to extract a surface. We further implement SALS with a neural network, producing a new neural implicit presentation. Additionally, based on SALS, we design a novel learning-based pipeline for reconstructing surfaces from 3D point clouds. We conduct extensive experiments, showcasing the significant advantages of our methods over state-of-the-art methods. We have included the source code in the Supplemental Material.",

                "value": "The paper presents a learnable surface extraction method based on edge-based dual contouring. Similar to Neural Dual Contouring (NDC), it uses a network to predict an intersection or crossing flag per edge. However, unlike NDC, it optimizes vertex locations within each cell using a Quadratic Error Function (QEF) rather than predicting them directly through the network. This optimization requires both the position of the intersection along each edge and its normal direction. Consequently, in addition to predicting the intersection flag, the network is also trained to output a scalar value representing the intersection position on the edge, using a concatenation of the corresponding cell vertices as input. Instead of the normal direction the paper the gradient of this intersection scalar  which is shown to  align with the the normal direction.\n\nExtensive experiments validate the method\u2019s effectiveness, leveraging the ABC and non-manifold ABC datasets to evaluate implicit representation in addition to DeepFashion3D, Synthetic Rooms, and Waymo datasets to illustrate generalization of  models trained with a subset of Thingi10k."

The idea is to encode how an arbitrary line segment intersects a surface, represented by a binary variable showing intersection or not, and a scalar within [0,1] showing the ratio of the intersection point along the line segment. The motivation for using such a line segment representation is that to extract surfaces from implicit fields, one usually has to find such intersection points for regular grid edges, as done in marching cubes and dual contouring. The paper does analysis of this line segmentation representation, presents a dual contouring adaptation for this representation, develops a learning based network design for generating such a representation, and conducts experiments for shape encoding and shape reconstruction from point clouds, where the method shows improved accuracy than alternative representations like SDF and UDF. \n\nThe idea makes sense intuitively by directly catering for the surface extraction step when learning the implicit rep, and is novel as far as I know. Given the novelty of the approach, some questions can be answered to better understand the approach. See the questions below."

Such cases should be common when the line segment is larger than the local feature size.\n\n- I am not sure the proof for Theorem 1 is correct. Why are p and n not functions of u/v? What assumptions have to be made about the surface, to ensure this invariance to u/v?\n\n- Eq(2), should there be a square of the dot product? Otherwise the minimization is not bounded from below.\n\n- Sec.3.3, it's said that surface normal is determined as the gradient of s. But the gradient is taken with respect to which variable? u or v? What if they give different gradients?\n\n- Related to the above question, the network producing the line-segment field should have certain invariance and equi-variance. That is, with respect to the switch of u/v, its output o (binary intersection) should be invariant, and its output s (ratio) should be equivariant. But the network design in its current form seems not preserve such properties.\n\nThe results frequently show holes that are undesirable. Such holes would not appear for SDF based methods. What can be done to fix such issues?\n\nThe ablation about normal vectors (Sec.4.3) is quite obscure, with only one visual example and minor differences. Can quantitative differences be observed with or without normal vector for dual contouring?"
