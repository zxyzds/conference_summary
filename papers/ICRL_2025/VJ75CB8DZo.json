    "title": "Correlational Lagrangian Schrodinger Bridge: Learning Dynamics with Population-Level Regularization",
    "abstract": "Modeling population dynamics is a fundamental problem with broad scientific applications.\nMotivated by real-world applications including biosystems with diverse populations, we consider a class of population dynamics modeling with two technical challenges: (i) dynamics to learn for individual particles are *heterogeneous* and (ii) available data to learn from are *not time-series* (i.e, each individual's state trajectory over time) but *cross-sectional* (i.e, the whole population's aggregated states without individuals matched over time).\nTo address the challenges, we introduce a novel computational framework dubbed **correlational Lagrangian Schr\\\"odinger bridge** (**CLSB**) that builds on optimal transport  to \"bridge\" cross-sectional data distributions. In contrast to prior methods regularizing all individuals' transport \"costs\" and then applying them to the population  *homogeneously*, CLSB directly regularizes *population* cost allowing for population *heterogeneity* and potentially improving model *generalizability*.\nSpecifically our contributions include \n**(1)** a novel population perspective of the transport cost and a new class of population regularizers capturing the temporal variations in multivariate relations, with the tractable formulation derived,\n**(2)** three domain-informed instantiations of population regularizers on covariance, and **(3)** integration of population regularizers into data-driven generative models as constrained optimization and an approximate numerical solution, with further extension to conditional generative models.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate the superiority of CLSB in single-cell sequencing data analyses (including cell differentiation and drug-conditioned cell responses) and opinion depolarization.\nCodes will be released upon acceptance.",

                "value": "This paper looks at the question of modeling population dynamics. The setting is one where the data is sampled cross-sectionally, and the goal is to bridge these cross-sectional snapshots. For one, these snapshots may even lack observations on the same population due to the way the data is acquired, for example, in immunomics-type of applications. Traditional approaches to such problems attempt to utilize methods that bridge the distributions together across time with, for example, techniques such as optimal transport. This paper proposes a way to do this bridging in a more principled way, through utilizing regularization at the population level. The key idea here appears to be, effectively, restraining population covariance kinetics-related quantities. The proposed method is compared to existing ones, with promising results."

It is suggested that in the absence of association between observations and members of the population that it is more sensible to conduct modelling at the population level.\n\nWithin the Schroedinger bridge framework, i.e. with initial an final distributions known and fixed, the problem of determining the trajectories from observations is viewed as an optimal transport problem. A major element of the current work's contribution is to consider regularisation of this process at the level of the population rather than of the trajectories of individuals.\n\nNumerical results are presented for a cell-sequencing setting which demonstrate the good performance of the proposed approach in that setting."

                "value": "One thing that wasn't completely clear to me (this isn't an area I am particularly familiar with) was what the main reasons for the audience of this conference to be interested in this work are. It seems like a nice contribution to learning for particular settings, in which a population-level view is reasonable but beyond the rather specific numerical examples in a cellular context it wasn't clear to a non-expert what those contexts might be. Are the authors able to explain this a little more explicitly?\n\nThe underlying motivations wasn't articulated as clearly as it might have been in my view -- beyond leading to a more tractable optimisation problem, when/why would one choose to view the problem of inferring dynamics in this population-level way? (The fact the individuals may behave heterogeneously and one may not be able easily to relate observations to individuals does not in and of itself seem to mean that a population-level regularisation is the natural way to proceed.)\n\nThe numerical evaluation appears to be limited to a single setting which is quite difficult for a non-expert to interpret, although there are numerical quantifications provide which appear to demonstrate good performance in that setting. It might be more persuasive if there were numerical results illustrating the proposed approach in several settings illustrating good performance across a wider range of scenarios particularly if the paper's contribution is to be viewed as general methodology rather than an application to the setting of the numerical example. There are some additional experiments in  Appendix I, but these are primarily very closely related to the original application with on exception on \"opinion depolarisation\" but the presentation here is so condensed that it is not completely obvious what is shown.\n\n\n\nMinor details:\n* There are places where more proofreading would help, e.g. in the references line 544 has `Schr\\\"odinger'"

Are there contexts of broad interest to the ICLR community which involve cross-sectional observations in which population-level regularization would be reasonable?\n\nIt seems that moving from individual level to population level regularization is a philosophical change in position rather than a choice to be made for computational reasons. To the non-expert, it feels like a reasonable shift where it is reasonable to suppose that there is some (implicit or explicit) population-level control of the dynamics -- perhaps in the context of hives, or coordinated systems -- but which is unlikely to model well the behaviour of a population of autonomous individuals. I was surprised not to see anything along these lines discussed in the manuscript. Are the authors able to comment on this?\n\nFigure 1: How should the reader interpret this and the many similar figures in the paper? This isn't an area with which I am familiar and I found it difficult to understand what I was supposed to deduce from this figure.\n\nLine 236: A very minor point, but can you clarify what this multiset is?

They motivate their problem with the relevant biological setting of predicting the influence of drugs on cell state, where cell state can only be measured once in a destructive process. The paper dives into details pertinent to this biological problem such as how to apply the method when in a latent space imposed e.g. by PCA. My main critiques are in the presentation of the method which makes checking the math difficult at times. This concern about presentation and validity of the method is mainly due to the lack of convincing empirical evidence. The proposed method seems to only occasionally outperform in the unconditional evaluation. I would feel more confident in this paper with better presentation and clarity."

Figure 2 uses PCs for the gene expression trajectories but it would make more sense to present the way Tong et al. 2023 did in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03672) in Figure 3. This would make the value of the method more immediate to computational biologists. The current method showing PCs of individual genes is unintelligible. This change would greatly help clarity for a more diverse audience. Additionally, I'd recommend using this compressed representation in the appendix. Just showing pairwise plots of seemingly random genes and expressed vs. predicted is not very helpful, unless I'm missing something related to the covariance that this method proposes. If there's something there that makes those plots more interpretable, you should highlight that in the main paper.\n- In proofs for the k $\\geq$ 2 case, I would prefer if you introduce the operators before just laying everything out in 14. It's very taxing to have to crossvalidate the equation with its parts and doesn't make me confident in the validity of the proof. Additionally, a sketch of proof saying how it works in summary would greatly help. Still, I have concerns related to the previous questions that don't allow me to fully check this proof, e.g. what is the purpose of using the product operator in this case. \n- it's hard for me to validate the proofs missing interpretation about what the product is that defines the correlation structure in the first place."

It's not clear to me how you actually do this from the paper. More clear exposition would help here. As well, why not investigate the hyperparameter sweep of these variables?\n- You prove the light tailedness in the appendix but only mention its importance in the main paper. It would be helpful to have some more context about this and why it's cancelled from the proof in the paper.\n- What's the computational complexity of this method? How are you sampling? You don't need a section on these but please mention a high-level complexity and state how you sample trajectories.\n- In proof for $k \\geq 2$ in the appendix, what is $\\mathcal{S}'$ and $\\Upsilon'$? in equation 14."
