    "title": "A Scalable Temporal-Spatial Framework for Transaction Anomaly Detection in Ethereum Networks",
    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of the Ethereum network necessitates sophisticated techniques to ensure its robustness against potential threats and to maintain transparency. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have pioneered anomaly detection in such platforms, capturing the intricacies of both spatial and temporal transactional patterns has remained a challenge. This study presents a fusion of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Temporal Random Walks (TRW) enhanced by probabilistic sampling to bridge this gap. Our approach, unlike traditional GCNs, leverages the strengths of TRW to discern complex temporal sequences in Ethereum transactions, thereby providing a more nuanced transaction anomaly detection mechanism. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our TRW-GCN framework substantially advances the performance metrics over conventional GCNs in detecting irregularities such as suspiciously timed transactions, patterns indicative of token pump and dump schemes, or anomalous behavior in smart contract executions over time. As baseline algorithms for comparison, common unsupervised methods such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and DBSCAN (as classifier for TRW-GCN embedding) are employed; finally our novel TRW-GCN plus scoring method is compared with the state-of-the-art temporal graph attention algorithm.",

The literature survey completely bypasses TimeSAGE [1] (citation below), which incorporates temporal random walks in GraphSAGE (a generalization framework for GCNs). The framework presented here seems to have extremely high resemblance to [1]. Therefore, I\u2019d appreciate a better positioning of the current work against [1].\nW2. The theorem statements are vague and require proper statements. For example, Th 1, \u201cEnhancement ineffectiveness,\u201d is quite vague and doesn\u2019t really convey anything. Similarly, Theorem 3 feels incomplete. The words in the theorem statements are not analytically defined. I\u2019d appreciate a better presentation of the theorems.\nW3. The choice of hyperparameters are arbitrary e.g. walk length and num_walks etc. How sensitive are the results with respected to these hyperparameters. A discussion of rationalbehind hyperparameter values will surely improve the paper, and may provide insights into effects of each hyperparameter. \n\n\n[1] Shekhar, S., Pai, D., & Ravindran, S.

The abstract does not specifically describe the innovations of the paper, which makes it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the core of the article from the abstract.\n2. The paragraphs in the introduction seem to be pieced together, lacking coherence. I recommend the authors improve the readability of the paper.\n3. Although the authors mention in lines 60-61 that the Ethereum network needs to consider temporal dynamics, I still do not understand the background regarding why temporal correlations must be considered in the Ethereum network.\n4. Previous work has already shown many sampling-based GNNs, like literature [1], and there are already numerous works on anomaly/phishing scam detection in the Ethereum network based on random walks [2]. The TRW mentioned in section 2.1 does not seem to present any novelty. Unless the authors can clarify further, I think the novelty of this paper is not enough to be published in ICLR.\n5. There are some writing errors: line 120 should refer to P_{ij}; the variables I and j in formulas (2) and (3) should both be in italics.\n6. The physical meanings of V, E, and F in line 95 are not clearly described.\n7. It is recommended that the authors include a link to a code repository in the paper and open-source the code, as this would not only enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the research but also allow other researchers and developers to further explore and improve upon this framework, leading to broader applications.\n\n[1] Bai, Youhui, et al. \"Efficient data loader for fast sampling-based GNN training on large graphs.\" IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 32.10 (2021): 2541-2556.\n[2] Yan, Chuyi, et al. \"Aparecium: understanding and detecting scam behaviors on Ethereum via biased random walk.\" Cybersecurity 6.1 (2023): 46."

Given the substantial size and continuous growth of the Ethereum blockchain, efficient sampling methods are essential. The GCN, trained with TRW nodes, provides a solution that balances accuracy with computational efficiency.\n3. Decentralized networks are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, particularly those that exploit timing vulnerabilities such as front-running attacks. This proposed GCN with TRW integration aims to detect complex patterns such as MEV bots, rapid buying or selling of assets, or others which are activities that can exhibit time-sensitive nomalies; manual inspection is then necessary for further investigation of the attack."
