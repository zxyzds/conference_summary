    "title": "MambaVC: Exploring Selective State Spaces for Learned Visual Compression",
    "abstract": "Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 7.2% and 15.2% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MambaVC-408 and will be open-sourced.",

The effectiveness of Mamba has been demonstrated on various CV tasks like image restoration (MambaIR), image recognition (VMamba), etc. The VSS block has been proposed in VMamba. Applying Mamba to learned image compression without a specific design does not meet the novelty bar of ICLR. Below are some suggestions on novelty and experiments.\n\n[1]. For the experiments on image compression (section 4.2 and section 4.3), the authors should at least compare with LIC-TCM (Learned Image Compression with Mixed Transformer-CNN Architectures). The main difference between the proposed method and LIC-TCM is replacing the TCM block with the VSS block if I understand correctly.\n\n[2]. To increase the novelty, the authors can consider different designs for the encoder and the decoder. In learned image compression, the encoder needs more contextual information, therefore, blocks like transformer and Mamba are more suitable for the encoder. However, the decoder needs to recover the image details, therefore, blocks like convolution might be more suitable for the decoder."

The authors do not compare their work with current SOTA methods. The comparisons in Figure 3 do not include newer SOTA experiments, such as work [1] published at ICLR 2024 a year ago.\n3. The authors do not clearly explain the motivation for using Mamba in visual compression tasks. Compared to the changes from CNNs to Transformers, Mamba is more akin to a variant of Transformer rather than a completely different operator.\n4. The proposed design for adopting Mamba in visual compression tasks lacks innovation and seems similar to the existing Vision Mamba [2].\n5. In video compression experiments, the performance of the proposed method is inferior to the existing open-source official standard model, HEVC (HM).\n\n\n----\n1.

Based on the experimental results, these methods achieve better performance than MambaVC. \n\n- Most learned image compression methods provide experiments optimized with MS-SSIM.

Providing a clear comparison would improve clarity.  \n\n-  Why is changing only the nonlinear transformation structure insufficient for capturing additional redundancy? Is it influenced by the accuracy of motion estimation? Could state-of-the-art video compression methods serve as a baseline instead of SSF[4]? If even traditional compression methods like HEVC are not outperformed, does this experiment have meaningful significance? Traditional methods are likely to have a clear advantage in terms of efficiency.\n\n- Considering the standards of ICLR, the technical contribution of this work does not appear significant, as it primarily involves the straightforward application of a VSS block on an existing visual compression baseline.\n\n[1] MLIC++: Linear Complexity Multi-Reference Entropy Modeling for Learned Image Compression, ICMLW 2023.\n\n[2] FTIC: Frequency-Aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression, ICLR 2024.\n\n[3] GroupedMixer: An Entropy Model with Group-wise Token-Mixers for Learned Image Compression, TCSVT 2024.\n\n[4] Scale-space flow for end-to-end optimized video compression, CVPR 2020"
