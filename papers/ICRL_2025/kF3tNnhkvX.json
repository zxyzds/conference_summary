    "abstract": "Learning from preferences has become a scalable paradigm for training high-capacity language models, as it is not limited to human-produced data, allowing models to surpass human performance.\nAdvanced feedback learning algorithms are typically online or iterative for high sample efficiency.\nAmong these, iterative preference optimization is popular due to its simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.\nHowever, in iterative preference optimization, models do not necessarily achieve optimal performance since they sequentially learn data from different distributions.\nA simple way to bridge the gap is model ensemble, which incurs excessive inference costs.\nInspired by the theoretical analysis for preference learning, we propose a simple model merging strategy that approximates model ensemble without additional training and inference costs, leading to Pareto-superior models.",

                "value": "The paper addresses the issue of distributional inconsistencies in Iterative Preference Learning and proposes a model merging approach to achieve Pareto-optimal outcomes, supported by a theoretical analysis grounded in Preference Learning principles.\nTwo key hyperparameters are introduced to control the magnitude and direction of the reward model ensemble, enhancing the effectiveness of the model merging strategy.\n It would be beneficial to clearly summarize and emphasize the core contributions of the paper.\nThe central novelty of this work is difficult to grasp. On one hand, model merging techniques have already been explored for (iterative) alignment in prior research. On the other hand, the paper claims that model merging results in a more accurate reward model, which is then utilized for alignment. If I have misunderstood this, I would appreciate clarification."

Combining model merging with SimPO to create more powerful models seems like a more compelling direction to explore.\n - The primary experimental results focus on the merging of alignment models rather than reward models, which weakens the evidence supporting the paper\u2019s claims about its effectiveness for reward modeling. The overall objective of the paper needs to be articulated more clearly.\n- The link between the claim of achieving more accurate reward models and the performance improvements in iterative optimization is insufficiently developed. Given that the ArmoRM reward model is used offline in iterative alignment, it is essential to conduct experiments using DPO-based reward models for iterative learning to validate the approach [2].\n\n  \n[1] The LLaMA 3 Herd of Models\n\n[2] Lambert, Nathan, et al. \u201cRewardbench: Evaluating reward models for language modeling.\u201d _arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.13787_ (2024)."

Specifically, what does it mean to obtain a more accurate reward model based on the DPO framework? Additionally, since ArmoRM is utilized to select preferences, have you explored using DPO as a reward model (RM) to select preferences during the preference learning process? Clarifying this would greatly improve the understanding of your methodology."

However, this simplification overlooks the highly non-linear nature of deep language models due to complex activation functions like softmax. This means that higher-order terms, which can have significant effects, are ignored, potentially leading to inaccurate approximations. Additionally, the assumption that $\\theta_t$ is close to $\\theta_0$ may not hold in practice, especially when parameter differences are large, further reducing the reliability of the approximation.\n\n---\n2. The statement: \"We hypothesize that such training may deprive the performance of the final reward model and policy,\" lacks references or empirical evidence. This makes it difficult to confirm that the identified issue exists or that the proposed solution effectively addresses it, thus weakening the rationale behind the study.\n\n---\n3.

While the primary difference is that the merged checkpoints in the proposed method are derived intuitively rather than offline.\n\n[1] Rewarded Soups: Towards Pareto-optimal Alignment by Interpolating Weights Fine-Tuned on Diverse Rewards\n\n\n---\n4. Although the authors emphasize their scenario in an iterative setting rather than offline, the technique of using linear interpolation of parameter is fairly standard. The method seems to have been applied specifically to the iterative scenario without significant innovation in the underlying approach, which reduces the overall novelty of the contribution.\n\n\n---\n5. The paper does not address potential failures associated with the parameter-merging paradigm, as discussed in [2].

However, the key assumption for the first-order Taylor series expansion to be a good approximation is that $\\Delta \\theta$ should be sufficiently small relative to $\\theta$, so the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion can be safely ignored. The authors did not illustrate whether this important assumption holds.\n\n2. For the main results reported in Table 2, it needs to discuss the training costs of the proposed method and the baselines to ensure a fair comparison. It is hard to tell whether the performance gain comes from the training overhead based on the limited implementation details as described in the current version.\n\n3. While discussed in related works, the model merging methods are not compared in experiments. It will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method by including other model merging methods in experiments.\n\n4.

Results are only provided for dpo training baselines on Llama-8B, which weakens the authors' claims of effectiveness.\n2. The main results are not compelling. The merged model does not demonstrate a clear performance gain compared to the individual checkpoints used for merging.\n3. ExPO is highly relevant to the proposed method, simply mentioning that ExPO is a special case of Eq(2) is not enough. More experimental comparisons between ExPO's model merging method and the proposed method are needed, both on Qwen2 and Llama3.\n4. The abstract is overly brief and does not adequately focus on the proposed method or the experimental results. Similarly, the introduction provides only a general overview of iterative preference learning, with little attention to the motivation behind the proposed approach. The only mention of motivation is on Line 56: \"such training may deprive the performance of the final reward model and policy.\" However, this is presented as a hypothesis, without any preliminary experimental evidence to support it. This severely limits the overall contribution of the paper.\n4. The figure captions lack detail and clarity. For instance, in Figure 2, \"the scaling curve of $\\alpha$\" could benefit from a more thorough explanation, particularly regarding the y-axis and its significance. Figure 4 suffers from the same issue.\n5. Captions for Figures 5 and 7 should include a summary of the key takeaway; otherwise, their purpose is unclear. In addition, the statement that \"some data are not shown for illustration purposes\" is vague. The authors should explain what data is omitted and why its exclusion does not affect the main point they aim to convey.\n6. The abstract claims the proposed method can generate Pareto-superior models, but this is not convincingly supported by the experimental results. It's unclear to what method the Pareto frontier is being compared, and in which aspects the comparison is being made."
