    "title": "AcademicEval: Live Long-Context LLM Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length and labor-intensive annotation, and the label leakage issue in LLM training also poses a pressing challenge. Therefore, we propose \\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \\textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \\textit{i.e.}, \\textsc{Title}, \\textsc{Abstract}, \\textsc{Introduction}, and \\textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \\textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \\textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct holistic experiments on \\textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, illustrating the challenge of our benchmark. We also provide insightful analysis for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- While the benchmark is about long context text-generation, focusing on generating the 4 subsections of Arxiv makes the benchmark not comprehensive enough for evaluating how well an LLM performs in  the grandiose task of long context text-generation. There are so many other long context text-generation tasks that require different type of reasoning and setup. The title might need to be qualified to something like \"evaluating llms on a subset of research paper generation\". How do you ensure this benchmark generalize to other long-context generation task?\n\n- RougeL and BERTScore don't seem like they are good measures for evaluating whether the generated text is good enough. BERT in BERTScore has been trained on extracting embeddings from small chunks of text to identify things like sentiment, and RougeL checks for word-for-word overlap which doesn't make sense in these ArXiv generation tasks since there are so many different ways we can semantically write the same thing for the introduction. Why would BERTScore be a good measure to test whether two \"Introductions\" are similar? One valid possible metric is G-Eval which was used to evaluate whether two free-form texts are similar, which seems to be valid in this case. Have you considered such a metric?\n\n- There needs to be human evaluation to see if BERTScore matches with how humans would judge a paper, I would say that is the only way to know if the BERTScore measure makes sense for these tasks. Have you considered such a process?\n\n- For the related work section, there are so many permutations and subsets of the literature that can be cited and still would make the section valid. Also, there are so many ways to relate the paper with the paper at hand - how do you make sure those type of generations are not penalized just because they are not almost word for word of the groundtruth data? \n\n- While the idea of using live evaluation is nice, evaluating whether a new model is good in comparison to the older ones would require us to re-evaluate all the models on the new data which makes things costly and unscalable. A better approach would be to have a hidden test set that is not in ArXiv to make sure that the models would never have never seen them (avoiding label leakage). That way when we have a new model, we can just evaluate it and add its score to the benchmark. Fixed benchmarks are always better in this regard of having a scalable, consistent test bed."
