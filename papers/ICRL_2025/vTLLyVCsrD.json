    "title": "Improving Generalization of Meta Reinforcement Learning via Explanation",
    "abstract": "Meta reinforcement learning learns a meta-prior (e.g., meta-policy) from a set of training tasks, such that the learned meta-prior can efficiently adapt to all the tasks in a task distribution. However, it has been observed in literature that the learned meta-prior usually has imbalanced generalization, i.e., it adapts well to some tasks but adapts poorly to some other tasks. This paper aims to explain why certain tasks are poorly adapted and, more importantly, use this explanation to improve generalization. Our methodology has two parts. The first part identifies ``critical\" training tasks that are most important to achieve good performance on those poorly-adapted tasks. An explanation of the poor generalization is that the meta-prior does not pay enough attention to the critical training tasks. To improve generalization, the second part formulates a bi-level optimization problem where the upper level learns how to augment the critical training tasks such that the meta-prior can pay more attention to the critical tasks, and the lower level computes the meta-prior distribution corresponding to the current augmentation. We propose an algorithm to solve the bi-level optimization problem and theoretically guarantee that (1) the algorithm converges at the rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{K})$, (2) the learned augmentation makes the meta-prior focus more on the critical training tasks, and (3) the generalization improves after the task augmentation. We use two real-world experiments and three MuJoCo experiments to show that our algorithm improves the generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a meta-learning method to improve generalization in RL. The key observation of the paper is that poor generalization stems from poor adaptation of the meta-prior to certain (critical) tasks. Building on this observation, the paper proposes first to identify the critical tasks by learning a weight vector that scores the importance of the different tasks. Next, to solve a bi-level optimization method, where the upper level learns an optimal augmentation for the critical tasks (optimal in the sense that the mutual information between the meta-parameter and the augmented critical tasks is maximized), and the lower level learns the optimal meta-prior given the optimal augmentation learned by the upper level.  \nThe authors theoretically prove that the algorithm converges and improves generalization. In addition, the paper demonstrates that the proposed approach improves the performance of standard meta-RL algorithms in two real-world problems and three MuJoCo experiments."

                "value": "## Vague and Unsupported Claims\nA large number of vague, unsupported, or false claims are made throughout the work. This is worsened by the paper's writing and English being poor at many points. To list a few examples:\n* \"We propose the first explainable meta-RL method\" - This is vague since \"explainable\" is not clearly defined. Many prior task inference methods could be called explainable, as the inferred latent distribution can be used to generate interpretable predictions about the environment [1].\n* \"Since this new meta-policy generalizes well to additional tasks compared to the original meta-policy...the generalization over the whole task distribution is likely to improve.\" This is provably false, as it violates core No Free Lunch theorems in RL.\n* \"The proposed task augmentation...does not compromise the performance on the non-critical tasks\" - this is unsupported theoretically or empirically.\n* \"The meta-prior trained on the augmented data stores more information of the critical task\" - the augmentation method (linearly interpolating state-action-advantage triplets) does not add information about the target task, it just injects randomness into the data so increases entropy. This \"additional information\" is noise and it is unclear why this would improve performance.\n* \"Show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\" - the core meta-RL algorithm, MAML, is far from the state of the art and has been surpassed by a number of works in black-box meta-RL [1, 3].\n\nIn addition to this, there are multiple cases of algorithms being anthropomorphised, such as them \"providing an explanation\" and \"paying attention to some important tasks\", which are not rigorous terms and do not help in understanding the method.\n\n## Method Ambiguity\nAfter reading the work, it is unclear why the data augmentation method will improve generalization performance. As far as I can tell, the augmentation method applies linear interpolation between state-action-advantage triplets in the dataset, but the resulting values would have no reason to be valid in the source environment. Furthermore, the idea that this \"adds information\" to the task is false as the \"new data\"  is just noise. Finally, there's a repeated assumption that augmenting the data on challenging tasks will not impact performance on the remaining tasks, yet somehow improve performance on the challenging tasks. By No Free Lunch Theorems, this is cannot be the case.\n\n## Missing Related Work\nA large amount of prior work is omitted from the related work section. Namely, two highly relevant fields are omitted entirely: black-box meta-RL and unsupervised environment design (UED). The first of these aims to solve the same problem by learning policies with full memory across episodes [1, 3, 4], or parameterized objective functions to update agents [2, 5, 6]. UED [7, 8] studies the automatic generation of training environment distributions in order to maximise generalization performance. A common objective in this setting is minimax-regret, which makes the objective of the policy to maximise performance on the hardest training task. This is highly similar to the objective proposed in this work, yet it is uncited. The most relevant method to this paper is [2], which applies UED to meta-RL to learn a general-purpose objective function. Discussion of how this work compares to prior work from each of these fields would strengthen the contribution significantly.\n\n[1] L. Zintgraf, K. Shiarlis, M. Igl, S. Schulze, Y. Gal, K.

A key ingredient of RL is that  the RL agent would interact with the environment to generate new samples; this is different from supervised learning. Nevertheless,  the proposed design method can be directly used in supervised meta-learning.  The main technical component is just to use bilevel optimization to find the best coefficient in previous developed mixup data augmentation. This can be done in any learning scenarios. I suggest that the authors clarify \n \n2. The mapping from state-action space to reward is nonlinear in general, indicating  data mixture in the proposed data augmentation would not be valid samples.\n\n3. The knowledge of poorly-adapted validation tasks may not be available; focusing more on these poorly-adapted tasks could impede learning of other tasks, and augmenting critical tasks for these poorly-adapted tasks does not conceptually differ too much from using a larger weight, which could still not be able to improve the overall generalization performance.

However, I think some researchers will be interested, and I think it is of sufficient relevance to be considered for publication. The presentation could use work as well. More explanation of intuitions, fewer references to long proofs in the appendix, easier to parse notation, etc., would go a long way. Perhaps in the algorithm, instead of just referencing external equations, there might be a simplified example or at least an objective that could be mentioned to convey what is going on? Finally, the results appear with little discussion and and could be presented better, but are surprisingly expansive (including real world results) for a theoretical paper. It would still be great if the paper could be evaluated on distributions broader than MuJoCo and goal navigation (on drones). I am unclear if the stock benchmark fulfills this requirement. A task like Meta-World would be sufficient.\n\nMinor:\nThere are a number of parenthetical citations that should not be parenthetical, e.g., line 110."

If you are adding an additional level of optimization to meta-learning, which already typically involves bi-level optimization, this seems like it would add significant computation.

In addition to quantifying the additional computation, could you give a sense of how this would compare to other methods making use of additional compute? Perhaps you could apply a single-task long-horizon style PPG algorithm (Beck et al., 2023) off-the-shelf in the outer-loop to a meta-learning algorithm?\n3. If you have to compute weights such that the model performs better on a held-out set of tasks, can you not just use the held-out set of tasks to further optimize the meta-learning in an additional outer-loop? For example, find the best initialization such that when you meta-learn on it, you're meta-learning performance increases on the held-out set? (Or something along those lines.)\n4. Can you speak to the breadth of the task distributions evaluated? They seem fairly narrow.\n5.

Except for the evaluation results on the real world (which I appreciated before) and MuJoCo, there are no evaluation results on the algorithmic design and its effectiveness. It would be more appreciated if an ablation study could be added to show the effectiveness of the optimal augmenting strategy w.r.t critical tasks. Furthermore, in my view, poor tasks could have a large impact on the design of the whole algorithm, that says, if we set the poor tasks as the whole validation tasks, it seems that using the explanation (importance vector) is enough, why should choose to augment the tasks. Hence, it is necessary to point out the significance of augmenting the tasks.\n2. The paper states that the performance of non-critical tasks could not be affected even if augmenting the critical tasks and theoretically proves this claim based on conditional mutual information. However, I am skeptical about using the difference in conditional mutual information equal to 0 to prove the variation of performance. If the quantity of the augmented critical tasks is much larger than the non-critical tasks, the algorithm would overfit these augmented critical tasks and ignore the non-critical tasks. Hence, the performance on non-critical tasks would be inevitably affected. Based on this, the reason for abandoning assigning the weights to the training tasks is not enough.\n3. Some other methods in context-based meta-RL also adopt an informatic-theory-based approach to improve the generalization performance, like [1]. Though these methods are orthogonal, properly discussing them would be nice.\n4. I wonder if the number of tasks will have a greater impact on the performance of the proposed method.\n5. Solving the proposed algorithm needs to optimize two bi-level problems iteratively. It seems that there may exist some instability.
