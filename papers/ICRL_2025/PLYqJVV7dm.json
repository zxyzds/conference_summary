    "title": "CRAFT: Time Series Forecasting with Cross-Future Behavior Awareness",
    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is the crucial infrastructure in the field of e-commerce, providing technical support for consumer behavior analysis, sales trends forecasting, etc. E-commerce allows consumers to reserve in advance. These pre-booking features reflect future sales trends and can increase the certainty of time series forecasting issues. In this paper, we define these features as Cross-Future Behavior, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. To increase the performance of time series forecasting, we leverage these features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on real-world dataset. Experiments on both offline large-scale dataset and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAFT. Our dataset and code will be released after formal publication.",

                "value": "The research on CRAFT, while presenting a significant advancement in time series forecasting, does have certain limitations that can be discussed in terms of real-world data complexity, redundancy, interpretability, and data transferability:\n\n1. **Real-World Data Complexity and Variability:**\n   - Real-world data is often characterized by noise, outliers, and non-stationarity, which can affect the model's ability to learn accurate patterns. CRAFT may struggle to capture these complex dynamics, especially if they are not well-represented in the training data.\n\n2. **Data Redundancy:**\n   - The incorporation of CFB along with other features might lead to data redundancy, which could impact the model's efficiency and potentially its accuracy. There is a need for feature selection techniques to ensure that the information used is diverse and non-redundant, focusing on the most predictive signals.\n\n3. **Interpretability:**\n   - The black-box nature of some components in CRAFT, such as the Koopman Predictor Module, can make it difficult to interpret how predictions are made, which is a critical aspect for stakeholders who need to understand the reasoning behind the model's outputs.\n\n4. **Data Transferability:**\n   - The model's performance may not be consistent across different domains or datasets due to the unique characteristics of each data environment. The reliance on CFB, which may not be universally applicable, could limit the model's transferability to other contexts where such behavior patterns do not exist or are less pronounced.\n\n5. **Generalizability:**\n   - The study primarily focuses on e-commerce data, and it is unclear how well CRAFT would perform in other industries or with different types of time series data. Further testing and validation on a diverse range of datasets are needed to establish the model's generalizability.\n\n6. **Scalability:**\n   - The paper does not extensively address the scalability of the CRAFT model, particularly in handling large-scale datasets that are common in many real-world applications. The computational complexity and resource requirements could be a limiting factor.\n\n7. **Robustness to Changing Conditions:**\n   - The model's robustness to changing conditions, such as shifts in consumer behavior or market dynamics, is not fully explored. Real-world applications require models that can adapt to new trends and patterns over time.\n\n8. **Dependency on High-Quality Data:**\n   - CRAFT's performance is likely to be highly dependent on the quality and granularity of the input data. In scenarios where data is limited or of poor quality, the model's effectiveness may be compromised.\n\nAddressing these limitations would involve further research into robust data preprocessing techniques, enhancing model interpretability, and conducting cross-domain validations to ensure that CRAFT can meet the challenges of real-world data analytics."

Unlike traditional features that only use historical data to predict future trends, CFB includes partially observable future behavior, which can provide early indicators of upcoming trends. \nCRAFT integrates CFB through a structured, multi-module framework, including the Koopman Predictor Module (KPM), Internal Trend Mining Module (ITM), and External Trend Guide Module (ETG). \nTo further enhance prediction accuracy, CRAFT incorporates a loss function that accounts for upper and lower demand limits. \nThe authors validate CRAFT's effectiveness with offline experiments and online A/B tests, showing improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in both error metrics (MAE, RMSE, wMAPE) and application-specific metrics like Inventory Waste Rate (IWR) and Proportion of Hotels with Depleted Inventory (PHDI). \nOverall, CRAFT aims to leverage future behavior patterns effectively to improve TSF, particularly in scenarios where demand is partially predictable through pre-booked actions or similar forward-looking behaviors."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The research motivation has significant issues. Although there are instances in e-commerce where actions are taken at a past moment for a future one, it is evident that they are entirely corresponding. Changes in final labels can be understood as minor variations based on the booking situation. Therefore, even though the actual future events have not occurred at the current time, crucial actions that influence the future have already taken place in history. Introducing the so-called CFB data essentially involves bringing in a part of real future data, thus constituting data leakage. This approach is fundamentally distinct from previous attempts to introduce more features because earlier works aimed at extracting or learning more features from historical time series data without any data leakage.\n\n2. There are serious shortcomings in the survey of time series forecasting methods. The author noted PatchTST from ICLR 2023 but overlooked contemporaneous models such as TimesNet (CNN-Based)[1] and MICN (CNN-Based)[2]. The author mentioned Koopa from NeurIPS 2023 but failed to acknowledge concurrent models like WITRAN (RNN-Based)[3] and Basisformer (Attention-Based)[4]. Furthermore, no attention was given to any time series forecasting methods from ICLR 2024, such as FITS (MLP-Based)[5], TimeMixer (MLP-Based)[6], ModernTCN (CNN-Based)[7], and iTransformer (Attention-Based)[8].\n\n3. The model lacks innovation, as the designs in KPM, ITM, and ETG are primarily derived from previous works, making it challenging to identify entirely independently innovative content.\n\n4. Code was not provided, leading to poor reproducibility of experimental results.\n\n5. The experiments are insufficient as the methods compared are relatively older works and do not comprehensively prove the efficacy of the experiments. Additionally, the method proposed by the author can only be applied under the assumption of data leakage through CFB, making its applicability weak for scenarios with only labels. Moreover, in Table 2, it is evident that in certain instances, utilizing only labels yields better results compared to using CFB in nearly every baseline method. This further indicates that the effectiveness of CFB is not necessarily proven.\n\n6. The author did not present the full search space for reproducing the baselines. Results can vary significantly for the same parameters on different platforms. Therefore, a fair approach would involve setting a consistent search space for all methods on the same platform and determining the best parameters for each model on various tasks using a validation set. I noticed that the experimental platform used by the author is inconsistent with the platforms of the compared methods, so the author should address this to demonstrate the credibility of the experiments. Otherwise, it is challenging to eliminate the significant impact of parameter selection on the experimental conclusions.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Wu, H., Hu, T., Liu, Y., Zhou, H., Wang, J., & Long, M.
