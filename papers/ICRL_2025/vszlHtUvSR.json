    "title": "RDHNet: Addressing Rotational and Permutational Symmetries in Continuous Multi-Agent Systems",
    "abstract": "Symmetry is prevalent in multi-agent systems. The presence of symmetry, coupled with the misuse of absolute coordinate systems, often leads to a large amount of redundant representation space, significantly increasing the search space for learning policies and reducing learning efficiency. Effectively utilizing symmetry and extracting symmetry-invariant representations can significantly enhance multi-agent systems' learning efficiency and overall performance by compressing the model's hypothesis space and improving sample efficiency. The issue of rotational symmetry in multi-agent reinforcement learning has received little attention in previous research and is the primary focus of this paper. To address this issue, we propose a rotation-invariant network architecture for continuous action space tasks. This architecture utilizes relative coordinates between agents, eliminating dependence on absolute coordinate systems, and employs a hypernetwork to enhance the model's fitting capability, enabling it to model MDPs with more complex dynamics. It can be used for both predicting actions and evaluating action values/utilities. In benchmark tasks, experimental results validate the impact of rotational symmetry on multi-agent decision systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

Also, while authors claim \"They neither consider nor can be applied to continuous random rotational symmetry, which is precisely the focus of our work and is more aligned with real-world scenarios\", invariance to contiuous transformations are already studied in [1, 2]. So I wonder what are the contributions made by authors.\n\n2. The proposed method lack theoretical guarantees and seems largely empirical. I would recommend authors to add additional formal analysis for the proposed method.\n\n3. MARL should be considered as a Markov Game or Dec-POMDP, not a MDP, as stated in Section 3. The problem stated by author sees more like a Dec-POMDP, which is cooperative MARL. This should be explicitly stated.\n\n4. The authors could consider evaluating their method on some real-world tasks instead of toy simulations to better demonstrate their applicability in \"real-world scenarios\". \n\nMinors: please check the typos, such as Sec. 4.3, ALGORITHM INPLEMENTATION should be ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION.
