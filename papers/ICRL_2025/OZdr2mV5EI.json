    "title": "Instruction Contrastive Tuning for Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) requires retrieving a target image based on a composed query consisting of an image and accompanying text that modifies or instructs changes to the visual reference. This task is particularly challenging as it demands the model effectively follow modification instructions for accurate retrieval. Additionally, data acquisition difficulties hinder training models for specific tasks. To address these challenges, recent approaches explore Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR), mainly leveraging CLIP-based models with tailored projections to compose images and textual modifications. However, these base models are not trained on instruction-aware data, limiting their ability to effectively combine visual and textual cues. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method utilizing an instruction-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate unified embeddings that seamlessly integrate images and modification instructions. Instruction-tuned MLLMs inherently align vision and text while exhibiting strong instruction-following capabilities, though they are primarily used in text generation. We introduce a two-stage training strategy to efficiently transform the MLLM\u2019s text generation capabilities into embedding extraction, and further refining its ability to follow modification instructions in CIR. Our model demonstrates significant advancements in ZS-CIR, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across four public datasets: FashionIQ, CIRR, GeneCIS, and CIRCO. Our model highlights the potential of instruction-tuned MLLMs in capturing nuanced instruction comprehension and advancing CIR systems.",

                "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\nFor the novelty concern, please refer to the General Response.\n\n**Data Generation Quality**\n\nIn our data generation process, we employ an automatic filtering strategy: outputs that fail to conform to specific templates for modification instructions and captions are discarded. We also leverage the Chain of Thoughts approach to enhance the quality of triplet generation. This strategy is labor-free and easy to implement, making the auto-generated datasets valuable resources for training, as outlined in multiple existing works.\n\n**Other Baselines**\n\nCIReVL is a training-free approach and inherently non-trainable. MCL, on the other hand, leverages similar triplet datasets based on CC3M. However, at the time of our experiments, MCL\u2019s training codes were not yet available."

                "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**Inconsistent Baselines**\n\nZS-CIR is a type of problem and is model-agnostic. Therefore, frozen CLIP models are not the only choice for tackling these problems. Several approaches compared in our experiments, including E5-V, CIReVL, FROMAGe, and MCL, also involve LLMs, and all are ZS-CIR models. In contrast, approaches like VDG are semi-supervised methods, as their primary approach involves annotating data with MLLMs rather than directly conducting ZS-CIR. Additionally, VDG requires different data annotations for specific downstream tasks. In practice, specific data annotations may not always be available. InstructCIR, however, is trained once and directly applied to various scenarios, maintaining the zero-shot setting.\n\n**Confusing Novelty**\n\nWe clarify that CIR is inherently an instruction-following task, differing from traditional image-text retrieval based on semantic similarity. CIR requires the model to understand what changes are necessary according to the instructions and apply them to the image. For example, if the instruction is \u201cchange the dog to a cat in the photo,\u201d the model must comprehend the semantics to replace the dog object with a cat. Therefore, instruction-following capability is essential, making an instruction-tuned MLLM an ideal embedding model. However, directly using MLLMs presents a challenge, as they are primarily designed for text generation rather than embedding extraction. Our two-stage training strategy effectively addresses this by enabling the MLLM to learn a joint multimodal embedding space and fine-tune it with triplet data similar to the CIR format. These strategies significantly improve performance compared to baselines in experiments.\n\n**Limited Technical Contribution**\n\nWhile our approach draws inspiration from LLaVA, InstructCIR is fundamentally different. LLaVA is designed for text generation, whereas our approach focuses on composed image retrieval. InstructCIR is an embedding model rather than a generation model like LLaVA. Furthermore, our training strategy is specifically curated for composed image retrieval, aiming to learn a joint embedding space and adapt the model for instruction-aware composed embeddings. In contrast, LLaVA\u2019s training strategy primarily adapts an LLM for multimodality, enabling it to become an MLLM.\n\nRegarding directly using ChatGPT for CIR, one of our baselines, CIReVL, leverages this approach but requires BLIP2 for captioning during inference. Our model is significantly smaller and faster than CIReVL while achieving better performance. Additionally, ChatGPT may not be feasible in certain commercial scenarios due to privacy concerns.\n\n**Resource and Time Consumption in Practical Applications**\n\nOur approach leverages Phi-3.5-mini as the LLM backbone, a much smaller model than general LLMs, enabling deployment even on mobile devices. Although larger than previous methods like Pic2Word, InstructCIR is the smallest among LLM-based approaches (FROMAGe, CIReVL, MCL). In practical applications, target image embeddings can be pre-computed and cached, further reducing retrieval time.\n\n**Comparison Not Fair?**\n\nWe ensured a fair comparison by retraining a variant of ViT-L with an image size of 224x224, rather than using the commonly employed size of 336x336 in MLLMs, to align with baseline models. CIR is an image retrieval task, making the image component critical for consistency. We also note that baselines like MCL use LLMs and ViT-L while maintaining comparisons with ViT-L in their original papers.\n\n**Data Processing with GPT-4 and GPT-4-mini**\n\nThe primary goal of generating the triplet dataset is to support the second training stage, and it is not listed as a contribution. Analyzing which LLM generates the best triplet data is outside the scope of this paper. Given time and budget constraints, we selected GPT-4o for its superior overall performance and believe the dataset generated is of high quality."

                "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**Data Leakage**\n\nWe pay careful attention to ensuring there is no data leakage. Although FOIL uses some images from MSCOCO, it does not overlap with benchmark datasets as they come from different versions and splits. Additionally, FOIL does not include modification instructions used in CIR benchmarks. Therefore, our model does not encounter triplet data used in CIR benchmarks during training.\n\nTo further eliminate concerns, we have included results of InstructCIR trained only with LLaVA-Pretrain in Stage 1 in Appendix E. Even without FOIL data, our model significantly outperforms baselines. The purpose of using multiple datasets in Stage 1 is to show the benefits of training with diverse contexts.\n\n**Baselines Missing**\n\nWe would like to point out that methods directly using modified captions with retrieval models like CLIP have been verified by CIReVL, which is included in our comparisons. However, as captions are unavailable during inference, CIReVL employs BLIP2 (a much larger MLLM) to generate captions for testing images and then uses ChatGPT to derive modified captions. In experiments, InstructCIR significantly outperforms CIReVL.\n\n**Training Speed**\n\nPlease refer to the General Response."

                "value": "We thank all reviewers for their valuable comments.\n\nBelow we address two common concerns:\n\n**Efficiency**\n\nWe pay specific attention to balancing model efficiency and performance. Specifically, we do not leverage general LLMs as our backbone model. Instead, we use an on-device LLM, Phi-3.5-mini, which is lightweight and deployable even on mobile devices. While our approach is larger than previous methods like Pic2Word, it is the smallest among LLM-based models (CIReVL, MCL, FROMAGe, E5-V). Our model is half the size of these baselines while demonstrating significant advancements. Moreover, with the rapid development of on-device LLMs, the backbone LLM in InstructCIR can benefit from lighter and better LLMs in the future.\n\n**Novelty of the Method**\n\nWe would like to highlight the novelty of our approach. While existing works address MLLMs and LLMs in CIR, we are the first to use an instruction-aware MLLM as an embedding model for this task. We tackle the challenge of using an MLLM (originally used for text generation) in CIR with our novel training strategy. Specifically, the first training stage builds a multimodal embedding space for retrieval, while the second stage tunes the model to produce instruction-aware composed embeddings."

                "value": "1. The setting of this paper is inconsistent with standard ZS-CIR tasks [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which aim to leverage the frozen CLIP model with alignment knowledge to achieve zero-shot compose image retrieval. However, this method of pretraining the entire MLLM diverges from the established settings of published ZS-CIR models, which may not be a \"Zero-Shot\" setting in the ZS-CIR task. Therefore, it is unfair to compare. It seems more aligned with what \"the Semi-Supervision CIR\" [8] aims to address. This inconsistent setting may cause potential data leakage in the instruction tuning process, which is a fitting bias of the CIR data, leading to potential data leakage. Moreover, this method required training of the entire MLLM, introducing significant training parameter size, computational resources cost, and time increase, which is unfair compared to existing ZS-CIR methods.\n\n2. The novelty is confused. The primary motivation :``these base models are not trained on instruction-aware data, limiting their ability to effectively combine visual and textual cues.\u2019\u2019 is unreasonable to me. The authors should carefully explain the relation between \u201cinstruction-aware data\u201d and \u201cZS-CIR task\u201d; for example, why does ZS-CIR require instruction-aware data?\n\n3. The technology contribution is limited. The two-stage training method is really similar to LLaVA [9], which only add a special token [EOS] as the global feature for retrieval. The instruction data generation process, which leverages GPT-4o, is not analyzed. The qualitative results may show that GPT-4o could achieve the goal of this method, which aims to generate the modified caption. Therefore, I would like to question the necessity of this method.\n\n4. The inference stage for retrieval is NOT included in this paper, and the code are not given. This paper only shows the two-stage training process. However, the retrieval process, which is one of the most important stages, may be overlooked. The retrieval seems to leverage the MLLM encoder for all candidate images first and then uses the compose embedding as a query for retrieval. In this way, the computational resources cost and time required by this method are challenging for CIR, which is used in online e-commerce and recommendation systems. This raises me concerns about the practical significance of this method.\n\n5. The comparison of the main results might not be complete. For example, the SoTA of the CIRCO dataset is CIReVL(ViT-G-14) [6], and CIRR is LinCIR (ViT-G-14) [1], which this paper does not compare. This method includes a significant increment of modal size and pre-trained knowledge, which needs to be compared with ZS-CIR methods with larger CLIP backbones.\n\n6. Need more ablation studies.
