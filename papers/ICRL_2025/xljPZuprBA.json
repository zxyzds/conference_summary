To achieve this, the paper uses an edge-dependent graph model (EPGM), which they use to create controlled dependencies among edges, and proposes a tractable algorithm for graph generation. The study includes a theoretical framework, practical algorithms, and experimental validation to demonstrate the generation of graphs."

A formal definition and visual examples earlier in the text could maybe help clarify these aims.\n- **Limited Exploration of Desirable Properties**: The paper does not fully explore the binding approach\u2019s effects on other important network properties, such as modularity, conductance, and resilience, which are also highly desirable in certain domains.\n- **Dependence on Parameter Fitting**: The model generates graphs after fitting model parameters to real-world networks, rather than directly from scratch. It is unclear whether this model could lend itself to straightforward manual parameterization to generate synthetic graphs independently, a feature offered by models like the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) benchmark graph generator. This suggest that the graph generator has a narrow practical use.\n- **Scalability**: It is unclear if the model can efficiently generate realistic extremely large graphs, given that the experimental results focus on relatively small networks.\n- **Unclear Tractability**: The explanation of the binding schemes' tractability could be more detailed and intuitive, especially as it seems that binding is computationally slower than edge-independent methods, which could hinder its scalability to larger graphs.\n- **Comparison with Established Benchmarks**: The paper does not compare with the Lancichinetti\u2013Fortunato\u2013Radicchi (LFR) benchmark data generator, which also generates graphs with **power-law degree distributions, variability, and high clustering**. Given that the LFR model shares similar motivations and goals with the proposition, a comparison here would add necessary context. Additionally, faster and more efficient follow-up models to LFR align well with the goals of this study, particularly in terms of tractability."

See for example \n\nHarry Crane and Walter Dempsey. Edge exchangeable models for interaction networks.\nJournal of the American Statistical Association, 113(523):1311\u20131326, 2018. PMID:\n30467447.\n\nWeichi Wu, Sofia Olhede, and Patrick Wolfe. Tractably modeling dependence in networks\nbeyond exchangeability. Bernoulli, 31(1):584 \u2013 608, 2025\n\nPlease discuss more on this in literature.\n\t\t\n(b) The organization of the paper can be improved. For example, Definition 3.1 and Theorem 3.3  seem to take up too much space without demonstrating any clear importance. By contrast, the key definition of binding is placed in the appendix. \n\n(c) The authors focus a specific subclass ( good subsets ) of EPGM in section 4, however, why are the subsets considered are important? The paper can be improved if more motivation besides the feasibility are given. \n\n(d)   The authors should compare and discuss more general models, such as the graphon model and the exponential random graph model  as mentioned in their Section 3.2 in addition to the four specific models in Section 5.4.  These models exhibit edge dependence, and is able to produce many triangles (especially the exponential random graph). It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a discussion on these models. \n\n(e) Theorem 5.7 provides the probability result for 3-motifs only, and the proof uses an enumeration method  that could be difficult to extend to higher order motifs, which can be restrictive sometime in practice.  A way to alleviate this is to provide codes in package for motives 4,5,6 as discussed  in page 21. Also, please discuss how the closed-form varies with changes in \\( p \\), \\( g \\), and \\( R \\) for readers to better understand the results. Is it possible to consider several motives together? \n\n(f) Besides triangle, other network motives such as transitivity, can be important. Could the binding methods extend to 'transitivity' and 'triangle' simultaneously?  Also please add some reference for the importance of triangle since the paper focuses on this quantity. \n\n(g)The authors conduct fittings in their simulations, however, the discussion of fitting in the main text is quite limited. If possible, the authors could provide some discussion on the properties of fitting, such as consistency.\n\n(h) The results in Table 1 is a little confusing. In the caption it writes ``The statistics are averaged over 100 random trails\".  But the number of triangles are solved by  tractability results. The data set is given, so what does the `random trial mean'? For edge independent models, densities of triangles can be computed tractably, too. On the other hand, the results in Table 1 might not be very meaningful. First, the results show that a parameter of a model is close to the corresponding real world data. However, what really matter is that the proposed method can produce a graph with similar property in high probability, which can be evaluated using simulated mean squared of $($ground true $\\Delta$-generated $\\Delta$$)^2$. Second, the comparison is not meaningful. For instance, in the case of the ER model, the authors estimate the connection probability matrix using the ER graph, then optimize their model parameters (number of triangles) based on a loss function that relates to the triangles, and subsequently compare the number of triangles from their model with those from the ER graph. Then the results are surely better since the authors are optimizing the number of triangles (with respect to the observed number of triangles) in a large class of model that include the ER graph. On the other hand, ER model, or other independent edge model is not necessarily good for the real data set in addition to the discrepancy of the numbers of triangles. Therefore, improving in triangle numbers comparing with those possibly inappropriate model could be less significant in practice. The authors could consider comparing with other models that take into account triangles, such as exponential random graphs and others.\n\t\t\n(i)  Please discuss in  detail the differences between LOCLBDG and PARABDG, as these two methods are distinct (as evidenced by the results in Figure 3). It would be beneficial to explain under which scenario one should choose LOCLBDG (or PARABDG)"

                "value": "This paper proposes the concept of binding to upgrade edge-independent random graph models, which are RGMs in which each edge is sampled independently. Binding allows for sampling a graph with given marginal probabilities for each edge, but with some dependence between the edges, allowing for more realistic graph distributions in terms certain statistics, like high clustering coefficient. The idea is to partition all possible edges, then to sample a single uniform random variable for each group in the partition, and add edges to the sampled graph if the random variable is less than edge's marginal probability. This adds edge dependence in the sense that if $e$ and $e'$ are in the same partition, and the marginal probability of the former edge is higher, then the sampling of the former guarantees the sampling of the latter. The paper then proposes a scheme for finding a partition at sampling time, as well as a parallelized scheme which relaxes the edge partition to independent edge groupings. Finally, the paper presents theoretical validation of the tractability of their methods, showing that the samples are generated in quadratic time; and empirical validation of the increased quality of samples when using binding, showing that upon fitting parameters of their model to match the input graph's triangle count, samples indeed match the triangle count closely, while not harming how well the node degree and node pair distance distributions are matched."

                "value": "This paper proposes a new configurable way to generate random graphs with dependencies between the edges, in a fine-grained way that make it possible to control parameters such as the number of triangles, clustering coefficients, etc. \n\nThe simplest and most famous random graph models, such as Erdos-Renyi, have edges appear independently of each other (in Erdos-Renyi for example the probability of each edge to appear is $p$, independently of all others). This kind of behavior makes analysis easier, but on the other hand it provably cannot capture properties of realistic graphs, such as a large number of triangles/motifs, and the tendancy of realistic graphs to be relatively clustered.\n\nMore modern random graph models, that are better at capturing real world characteristics, tend to have dependencies between the edges. One example is random geometric graphs, where points are randomly located on a high-dimensional sphere. But still, most of these models are not very flexible, they are controlled by some global parameters but it may be difficult/impossible for the designer to build a graph that matches specific desired properties.\n\nThis paper provides several variants of a new and simple method, called binding, to generate random graphs with high variability (i.e., that do not match a single specific pattern) but also being realistic (having high triangle density, high clusterability, etc). The core idea is simple, and stems from the following question: what is the random graph model with all edges appearing with probability $p$ (possibly dependently), and, say, the largest expected number of triangles? It turns out that this is the distribution which is equal to a complete graph with probability $p$, and empty graph otherwise. Binding is a similar process, picking the same \"threshold\" to groups of random nodes in order to create small cliques / dense graphs. The proposed model allows to work with predetermined edge probabilities, not necessarily uniform.\n\nThe authors propose a couple of different binding methods, one that is sequential and another one that is parallelizable and easier to analyze. They prove several theoretical results: for example, that it is possible to efficiently match a target expected number of triangles by a suitable optimization process. The authors also run some experiments demonstrating the verstality of this method in practice, showing ability to generate diverse and realistic degree distributions or obtain a large triangle coefficient. Another experiment shows that the running time is decently fast, especially for the parallelizable version."
