    "title": "Overcoming Lookback Window Limitations: Exploring Longer Windows in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future trends based on historical data. While longer lookback windows theoretically provide more comprehensive insights, current Transformer-based models face the Lookback Window Limitation (LWL). On one hand, longer windows introduce redundant information, which can hinder model learning. On the other hand, Transformers tend to overfit temporal noise rather than extract meaningful temporal information when dealing with longer sequences, compounded by their quadratic complexity. In this paper, we aim to overcome LWL, enabling models to leverage more historical information for improved performance. Specifically, to mitigate information redundancy, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Filter (IBF), which applies information bottleneck theory to extract essential subsequences from the input. Additionally, to address the limitations of the Transformer architecture in handling long sequences, we propose the Hybrid-Transformer-Mamba (HTM), which combines the linear complexity and long-range modeling capabilities of Mamba with the Transformer's strength in modeling short sequences. We integrate these two model-agnostic modules into various existing methods and conduct experiments on seven datasets. The results demonstrate that incorporating these modules effectively overcomes the lookback window limitations. Notably, by combining them with the Patch strategy, we design the PIH (\\textbf{P}atch-\\textbf{I}BF-\\textbf{H}TM), successfully extending the window length to 1024\u2014a significantly larger window than previously achieved\u2014and achieving state-of-the-art results, highlighting the potential of exploring even longer windows.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The long-term datasets are overused in the literature, perhaps also implying overfitting after so many modeling iterations have been made over these datasets. There is no evidence that any meaningful relations exist between variables in these datasets to support multivariate forecasting. Datasets are small and do not reflect the complexities that exist in production grade big datasets employed in industrial environment. As a result, we are most likely looking at overfitting artifacts when people continue perusing these datasets. I do not see evidence that there is statistical significance in results that researchers in the field continue to squeeze from these degenerate datasets.  The field should move on resolving more interesting and realistic large scale forecasting problems.\n\n- How do the multivariate results presented in the paper compare against univariate baselines. I do not believe there is evidence that these multi-variate models can even beat the univariate baselines, making the entire set of results look unconvincing to me. Please provide comparison between multivariate forecasting result and univariate forecasting results on the same data. I expect that the multivariate forecasting result should be significantly better than univariate to justify the additional complexity.\n\n- There is no evidence in the paper that setting lookback length to 1024 creates problems in other architectures. There is no evidence in the paper that increasing the length of the input to 1024 leads to significant accuracy lift in the proposed architecture. This basically undermines the pitch of the title \"Overcoming Lookback Window Limitations...\". Are there really significant limitations and the introduction of the current technique really solves it? Please provide evidence that increasing the lookback length to 1024 in the proposed architecture significantly improves accuracy compared to, say, lengths 512, 256 or 128.\n\n- The key focus of the paper is comparison against PatchTST. This is a 2-year old model with 900+ citations. Comparison against recent state of the art is missing. For example, https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/zhang24l/zhang24l.pdf, https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0608.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14616. This is a good reference for recent SOTA models https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09898\n\n- The application of the proposed technique to the most recent models is missing, making the results unconvincing. The authors claim that they developed a general technique. In all key studies they apply it only to PatchTST. In ablation study Figure 4 they apply only to Transformer (I understand this is vanilla transformer), Informer and Autoformer. All the the three models are so bad, I think doing anything on top of them, like a residual linear layer or MLP in parallel from input to output should do the job of improving their results and making them **at least** as good as the DLinear or NLinear. This intuition is supported by the fact that on the dataset used for the ablation, ETTm1, all these models are not even close to the linear baselines and they do not get much closer after the proposed technique is applied. Therefore, the results in this area are weak, making the claim ill-supported. Please provide evidence that this approach provides lift on more recent strong transformer-based architectures other than PatchTST."

The paper mentions the use of HYBRID-TRANSFORMER-MAMBA (HTM) to model long and short time series information separately, but it does not provide diagrams to detail how the Transformer and Mamba models are combined, reducing the comprehensibility of the method.\n2. Table 1 only shows results for L=1024, but some baseline methods may perform better with shorter lookback windows; therefore, it would be beneficial to provide the performance of each method under its original configuration.\n3. The authors select the best results for T=720 by choosing different lookback windows {24, 48, 96, 192, 336, 720, 1024}, which may seem unfair. The theory proposed by the authors should not only apply to long sequences; thus, the model's ability to extract information for any input length should be superior to the current best methods.\n4. The visualization results in Figure 3 (c) are intriguing. Could the authors please explain how this figure was obtained?"

The paper mentions several key hyperparameters, such as K, \u03b2, and \u03c4. Does the selection of these parameters have a significant impact on model performance?

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Concerns on SOTA Comparisons**: As a submission for 2025, it is surprising that the authors only compare with the 2023 PatchTST and the 2024 S-Mamba. Additionally, the comparisons with FEDformer and Autoformer (2022 and 2021, respectively) do not adequately represent the current state of the art. Please annotate each method with its publication year to provide context. While including S-Mamba is valuable, it is still an unpeer-reviewed work. A more comprehensive comparison with recent methods would enhance the submission's relevance and credibility.\n\n2. **Fairness of Window Size Comparisons**: The parameter settings for the baselines in Table 1 are not clearly defined. Results for FEDformer, Autoformer, and Informer seem to replicate those from PatchTST, but their lookback window $ L $ does not uniformly match the PIH setting of 1024. This raises fairness concerns and contradicts the authors' claim of not intentionally disadvantaging these models. I recommend creating two tables: one where all models are evaluated at $ L = 1024 $ and another using each model\u2019s optimal $ L $. Presenting both together would effectively demonstrate the significance of PIH's larger lookback window.\n\n3. **Experimental Rigor**: The authors state that PIH outperforms other models under shorter windows (e.g., 336 and 512), but this claim lacks rigor since only DLinear and NLinear are compared. According to Table 1, PatchTST appears to show superior performance. Additionally, since both PatchTST and DLinear/NLinear assume channel independence, it is crucial to compare with channel-dependent models in this context.\n\n4. **Minor Corrections**:\n   - In Figure 6, the left panel legend incorrectly states \"PHI\" instead of \"PIH.\"\n   - There is a duplicate paragraph on page 2: \"Moreover, it does not mitigate the quadratic complexity inherent in Transformers.\" This should be corrected."
