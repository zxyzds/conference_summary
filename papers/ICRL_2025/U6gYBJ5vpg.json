    "title": "EVO-RDesign: Leveraging Evolutionary Priors for Structure-Based RNA Design",
    "abstract": "Designing RNA sequences based on RNA tertiary structures is a crucial aspect of future RNA design with significant potential to aid drug development. Recently, deep learning-based methods have made progress in this area; however, these methods are constrained by the limited availability of RNA structural data, making it challenging to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, we propose EVO-RDesign, which leverages the evolutionary priors embedded in extensive sequence data to facilitate better RNA sequence design. Specifically, RNA language models have recently been demonstrated to learn the evolutionary information of RNA. Therefore, we consider RNA language models as repositories of evolutionary priors and design a series of adaptors that enable EVO-RDesign to retrieve these priors conditioned on the input RNA structural information. To achieve better performance, the adaptor innovatively inputs RNA structural information and outputs from existing RNA design methods into the language model. Experiments demonstrate that EVO-RDesign outperforms RDesign, achieving a 3.5% increase in sequence recovery on RNAsolo. It also exhibits zero-shot generalization, with gains of 5.1% and 4.1% in sequence recovery on RNA-Puzzles and Rfam, respectively. We also apply in-silico folding to validate whether the generated sequences can fold into the specified 3D RNA backbones.",

While the paper provides an overview of the EVO-RDesign framework, some technical details, such as the specific implementation of the structural adapter and attention bias guidance, are not fully explained. It is hard to follow. Provide more detailed explanations of the technical components of EVO-RDesign, such as the structural adapter and attention bias guidance, to facilitate better understanding and reproducibility.\n2. How does EVO-RDesign handle large-scale RNA structures? Are there any limitations in terms of the size or complexity of the RNA structures that can be designed using EVO-RDesign? What is the mean size of RNA sequences that you used or produced?\n3. The authors stated that \"EVO-RDesign,which leverages the evolutionary priors\", what can of prior information that you used? Could you explain these priors more? or give examples in details?\n4. In the abstract, the authors say they also apply in-silico folding, I guess it is better to add the conclusions of applying in-silico folding.\n5. The evolutionary information contained in RNA sequences, but this method used RNA structures as input, I deem the evolutionary information is already contained in the structures. More, in Fig.2, the important concept \"evolutionary priors\" is not appeared. \n6. In Fig, RNA consists of four types of nucleotide, what are the four types of nucleotide? \n7. In Line 76-77, the authors say they use RNA language model first, and then use the structure model, which is  consistent with Fig.2. More, what are FFN and MPNN in Fig.2. \n8.In Sec.1, the authors say \"However, these methods still face significant bottlenecks: the known RNA structure data is very limited.\" However, this method also faces this problem, as the model needs RNA structures as input.\n9. In Line 202-203, what is the K values in the K-nearest neighbors? What is the choose standard of K?\n10.Why you choose RDesign to extract the structural features, have you tried other structure encoders? Similar problem for the RNA Language Model.\n11. What is your future plan wet-lab validation?"

The provided candidates thus should be diverse while folding into the desired structure (a 3D backbone in this case). While I know that this has been done before, why do we train on sequence recovery then at all? This means that we are good at replicating the sequences we already know to fold into the structure. At least a measure of diversity would make sense to assess the distribution of generated sequences. \n- While the authors describe gRNAde as a related work, they do not include it into the evaluation?

I would strongly recommend the authors go through previous reviews and make necessary modifications and clarifications before submitting to another conference. \n- Why does the RNA structural featurizer have to go through a transformer layer, as stated in Equation 5, to be the input of the RNA language model? Since it is the most important part of this paper, I think it is worth more discussion.\n- The paper uses structural features from the RDesign model and designed a structural adapter as the input of RNA language model, which means the key information is just retained from those two pre-trained models and, maybe less significant to the RNA design field.\n- The paper uses RNA sequential evolutionary information before the sequence output, such design may have information leakage since the RNA language model is trained with raw sequences."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- My main question would be the information leakage issue, since the RNA language model is trained with sequences, is it proper to put it in the output layer of RNA sequence design model? For example, if the RNA-FM model has \"seen\" a similar sequence/embedding during its training phase, its output may tend to be like that sequence. However, as the recovery score(or accuracy) is less than half (overall), would such probabilities output mislead the RNA-FM model? Even more, when the input structure is not contained in the training dataset of RNA-FM, would the model give a relatively worse output than others? I suggest the authors have a more detailed clarification on this issue.\n- Another question is about the in-silico validation. The paper uses RhoFold to test whether the generated sequence could fold back into the original structure. It is indeed a pretty hard goal because RNA structure prediction tools are still unable to provide reliable predictions. - However, it might be helpful to have a quantitive analysis of the samples. For example, what kind of RNAs always have a better result than others, and what kind of sequence length may have the best results... Also, conducting such experiments on external datasets may also be helpful (as tested in the paper, RNA-puzzles)\n- Some other external datasets could be tested, such as Rfam, which has been used in the RDesign paper.\nWould other metrics also be helpful to evaluate the model's capability?
