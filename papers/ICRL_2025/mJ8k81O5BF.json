    "title": "IMPROVING LOW-BIT POST TRAINING QUANTIZATION: A DATA-FREE APPROACH",
    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) without access to real data is enabling efficient model optimization and deployment in scenarios where privacy or proprietary constraints restrict the use of original datasets. Traditional data free quantization methods rely on Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from the trained full-precision model to generate calibration dataset for quantization. However, this reliance on BN statistics limits their applicability to deep neural networks (DNNs) without BN layer such as AlexNet. In this paper, we propose a calibration dataset generation algorithm that is agnostic to BN statistics, leveraging just the backpropagation to create synthetic images for PTQ. We also demonstrate that it is not necessary to include samples from every target category in the calibration dataset to get the representative activation ranges for quantization. Extensive experiments with both large and lightweight models on large-scale image classification tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves quantization performance across various DNN architectures, especially in low-bit settings. Notably, in 4-bit quantization, we achieve an improvement of  3.42\\% in top-1 accuracy for the ResNet18 model and 3.14\\% for the InceptionV3 model compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) DSG method. Importantly, we use very few synthetic samples for quantization compared to other methods.",

                "value": "1. The performance gain of the proposed method is marginal. In particular, data-free quantization methods have already performed excellently for 4-bit to 8-bit quantization. To clearly demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed method, experiments should be conducted in low-bit (i.e., 2-bit or 3-bit) settings. For example, GENIE [1], a method that generates synthetic datasets for quantization, has shown strong performance in 2-bit and 3-bit quantization.\n2. Since CIFAR-10 already has a small number of classes, it is somewhat insufficient to prove the claim in the paper that \u201cselecting only a few target classes is sufficient.\u201d Validation on datasets with a larger number of classes, such as CIFAR-100, is needed.\n3. The proposed method claims performance gains regardless of the presence of batch normalization due to its agnostic nature. To support this, the method should be tested on a wider variety of models. While the paper only presents results for CNN-based models, it should also demonstrate performance on ViT-based models (e.g., ViT, DeiT and Swin Transformer).\n4. The writing can be further polished. There is some inconsistency in terminology throughout the paper. The term \u201csample\u201d needs to be clearly defined to indicate whether it refers to a category (i.e., class) or the number of synthetic data generated per category.\n\n[1] Jeon et al., \"GENIE: Show Me the Data for Quantization,\" CVPR 2023."

This would help emphasize the real-world applicability of the proposed method.\n(3) The paper does not sufficiently compare its data-free approach to non-data-free PTQ approaches that use real data. A more explicit comparison could help readers appreciate the trade-offs involved.\n(4) The authors could benefit from adding more ablation studies on the impact of key hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations (T) or learning rate (\u03b1), to demonstrate their influence on quantization performance. This could provide a more complete understanding of how to fine-tune the approach in practice.\n(5) The paper briefly acknowledges that BN-based calibration datasets can suffer from homogeneity, but a more thorough discussion on the limitations of the proposed method would make the paper more balanced. For example, scenarios where this approach might not work as effectively should be highlighted.\n(6) The computational cost of generating the synthetic calibration dataset via backpropagation should be better discussed. The time complexity of this synthetic data generation could be compared to that of traditional calibration datasets."

I'm very curious to see what are the differences between the author's method without access to BN information compared to DSQ, and what are the differences in the final simulated images by training under visualization; and what are the differences under the distribution of BN (even though the author's training doesn't use access to the BN, the ResNet network is still using the BN)\n3.
