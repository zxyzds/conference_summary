    "abstract": "Understanding the interactions between biomarkers across brain regions during disease progression is essential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease.  For example, in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions, existing models describe how variables interact with each other spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying causal substrate often based on brain connectivity. However, such methods typically grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity and brain pathology appearance and propagation. In this work, we propose a novel LLM guided spatio-temporal framework for disease progression, to model long-term disease progression on brain graphs based on discovery of structure from longitudinal population-level patient data. The new approach replaces the static brain connectome that drives most models of AD pathology propagation with a more comprehensive graph of local independencies jointly informed by human knowledge encoded in the LLM and observed patient data sets. Crucially, we formulate the method to work with typical medical data sets (cross-sectional or short-term longitudinal designs) in which the exact timepoint along a hidden underlying trajectory of change is unknown for each data point. Specifically, our method leverages a mixture of different LLMs as expert guides to constrain graph estimation. Furthermore, we account for the unknown temporal location of observations by embedding the proposed method within a dual-optimization framework, which simultaneously estimates a disease progression modelling (trajectory of change of biomarkers common to a population) and executes structure discovery (learning a graph capturing spatiotemporal influence among biomarkers). Experiments evaluate our method's performance in estimating regional tau-pathology propagation over the brain. Results demonstrate superiority over existing approaches using standard underpinning directed graphs estimated and fixed a-priori. Our method achieves higher prediction accuracy, faster and more stable convergence, and improves interpretability of the fitted model. The LLM produces additional factors that drive the disease which go beyond the factors contained in the prompt.",

            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "### Weaknesses \n\n1. **Vague Language and Disorganized Manuscript**:  \n   The paper uses terms like \"causal interactions\" without justification. The use of graph learning alone does not establish causation, as this typically requires specific assumptions or experimental design elements, such as interventions or causal inference techniques. Without these, the inferred relationships are associative rather than causal. Also,  the term \"long-term\" is not clearly defined, despite its critical importance in temporal modeling of disease progression. The lack of a precise timeframe (e.g., years or decades) makes it difficult to understand the model's intended scope and applicability. A clearer definition of \"long-term\" would strengthen the paper. Additionally,  there are instances where equations or concepts are referenced before they are defined, disrupting the logical flow and making it difficult for readers to follow. For instance, equation 9 is mentioned in the text (Section 2.2) before it is officially introduced (Section 2.5.1). Finally, there are several typos throughout the manuscript. Minor notice, but important, evaluation measures like SSE should be introduced first and then utilized with abbreviation for more clarity.\n\n2. **Lack of Comparisons with Baselines and Limited Qualitative Results**:  \n   Although the authors cite several relevant baseline methods, such as Bellot et al. (2021), they do not provide empirical comparisons. Without benchmarking against these established approaches, it is difficult to assess the advantages of the proposed method. \nAlso, there are no qualitative results with predicted trajectories that would showcase that the method works in several test examples.\nAdditionally, in section 3.3 and 3.4 of the results authors use only the Claude3.5 LLM. However, their proposed method is the mixture of the LLMs and not only a single LLM (Claude3.5). This inconsistency, weakens result's coherence  as well as the validity of the proposed method. \n\n3. **Questionable Prompt Strategy for LLMs**:  \n   The approach relies on querying LLMs with prompts for each brain region to infer relationships, which raises several concerns:\n   - **Scientific Validity**: General-purpose LLMs lack domain-specific scientific knowledge and are prone to hallucinations. This means that the generated weights or connections could be inaccurate or even fabricated.\n   - **Scalability**: The strategy of creating prompts for each brain region does not scale well for fine grained ROI brain representations, making it computationally intensive and potentially inconsistent.\n   - **Stability and Consistency**: Since LLM responses can vary with prompt phrasing, it\u2019s unclear if these outputs are reliable across prompts. An analysis of prompt sensitivity or consistency checks would be necessary to validate this approach.\n\n4. **Limited Longitudinal Data for Temporal Modeling**:  \n   With only 254 samples from 185 subjects, it appears that most subjects have only a single acquisition (baseline) and one follow-up. This data limitation raises doubts about the model\u2019s ability to learn meaningful temporal dynamics. The authors do not address how the model captures progression trends with such limited longitudinal data, leaving the temporal component of the model questionable.\n\n5. **Limited Discussion of Practical Application and Real-World Feasibility**:  \n    The paper lacks a detailed discussion of how the proposed Disease Progression Model could be applied in real clinical or research settings. The reliance on prompts and general-purpose LLMs may hinder broader adoption, as access to specific LLMs, prompt engineering, and technical resources may not be feasible in clinical environments. Addressing these practical challenges and offering guidance for real-world application would enhance the paper's relevance."

How do you handle repeated measures in the training process?\"\n\n2. **Ratio Specification for Mixing LLMs**:  \n   - \"How do you specify the ratio (0.865:0.135) for mixing the two LLMs? Could you provide a rationale or any empirical basis for choosing this specific ratio?\"\n\n3. **Cross-Validation for Robustness**:  \n   - \"A simple splitting of the 255 subjects into train-test-validation is not enough. A fold cross-validation (train-test-validation) splitting multiple times would produce more powerful results. Could you comment on the reason for choosing a single split rather than cross-validation?\""

However, the feasibility and power of LLM in understanding the etiology of AD is not clearly demonstrated. Our current understanding on disease mechanism is still elusive in the AD field. Not sure how the proposed approach could advance our current understanding on AD. \n\nAnother main concern is the data sample size. Neuroimaging data from ADNI is used in this work. There is only couple hundreds (<300) subjects having both modalities (structural connectome and pathology data). It is not clear how to address the issue small sample size.\n\nAlso, the data pre-processsing is not clear. Which brain atlas is used? Based on the node number, looks like the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. Please note this atlas does not include sub-cortical regions, means it is not a perfect brain parcellation for studying AD.\n\nResult interpolation lacks biological underpinnings and supporting evidence from current literatures in AD."

The representation of faster convergence (A.3), particularly between the second and third figures, could be clearer. Adjusting the scale might help elucidate this aspect.\u2028\n4. While the authors emphasize the importance of identifiability and interpretability, their discussion primarily revolves around reducing the number of edges in the graph. There is limited exploration or discussions on how the derived graphs enhance understanding of regional interactions and differences during disease progression compared to other graphs.\n5. In figure 4, descreasing the critical edge number throgu \u201c7-factor\u201d prompt is not very clear to me.
