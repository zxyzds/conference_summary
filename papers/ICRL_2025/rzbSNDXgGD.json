    "title": "Minimal Impact ControlNet: Advancing Multi-ControlNet Integration",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function\u2019s Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals.",

                "value": "This paper presents a well-designed approach to multiple CtrlNet integration by addressing the challenge of control signal conflicts through a \"minimal impact\" strategy. \nSpecifically, the authors address several issues they found in multi-ControlNet integration.\n1. To handle data bias in silent control regions, they use data augmentation and segmentation masks. This adds texture to low-signal areas. \n2. To avoid conflicts between control signals, they use an MGDA-inspired feature injection method. This balances gradients so that no single control dominates. \n3. They introduce a conservativity loss function to ensure stable training. This function keeps CtrlNet's influence to original U-Net minimal and improves consistency in multi-control outputs."

Since the experiments primarily focused on pairs of CtrlNets, I am curious about how well the approach scales to accommodate multiple CtrlNets.\n\nAdditionally, the authors mention the \"Conservativity of Conditional Score Function\", which seems to be a general principle that influences ControlNet performance, regardless of whether there is one or multiple CtrlNets in play. I wonder if the solutions proposed in this context could also enhance performance in standard single-CtrlNet applications. It might be beneficial for the authors to discuss this potential in the paper."

The only comparison is that both the original feature combination and a balanced version together between ControlNet and proposed model. For example, there are no comparison about Jacobian Asymmetry between the other baselines in Figure 4.(b). To claim the main contributions of each method, it would be beneficial to compare the performance improvements of each method against ControlNet.\n\nThe problem settings and the flow of the solutions are well-structured, however, the segmentation masking and the feature injection process shown in Figure 3 seems to be a little simple. Although the two main contributions(silent control signals, feature injection method) enhanced the model performance in the targeted problems, the method to apply the techniques are not quite novel. \n\nMinor:\n\nIn Figure 6, the legend seems to have lack of information."
