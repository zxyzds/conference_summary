    "title": "Global Context-aware Representation Learning for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics",
    "abstract": "Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of complex biological networks. Recently, graph-based deep learning has been utilized in identifying meaningful spatial domains by leveraging both gene expression and spatial information. However, these approaches fall short in obtaining qualified spot representations, particularly for those located around the boundary of cell type clusters, as they heavily emphasize spatially local spots that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Spotscape, which introduces the Similarity Telescope module designed to learn spot representations by capturing the global relationships among multiple spots. Additionally, to address the challenges that arise when integrating multiple slices from heterogeneous sources, we propose a similarity scaling strategy that explicitly regulates the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots to ensure they remain nearly the same. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, multi-slice integration, and alignment tasks, compared to baseline methods.

                "value": "This paper introduces a framework called Spotscape, designed to improve spatial transcriptomics data representation for enhanced analysis of spatial domain identification, and multi-slice integration and alignment. Spotscape utilizes a graph autoencoder and incorporates various loss terms to optimize the learning of spot representations, thereby improving clustering and alignment. Applied to five datasets, the framework demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting spatial domains of brain layers and mouse embryos, aligning temporal spatial transcriptomics data, and integrating spatial data across different resolutions."

                "value": "1. Current whole-transcriptomic spatial sequencing platforms, such as 10x Visium, face challenges with low spot resolution, where each spot may capture transcripts from tens of cells. This limits the accuracy of clustering spatial domains, like brain layers. Spotscape demonstrated notable improvements in domain prediction accuracy in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and mouse embryo data. \n2. Batch effects are a common challenge in integrating and aligning multi-slice spatial data, particularly for temporal data analysis. Spotscape showed superior performance in reducing batch effects across most datasets compared to other methods. \n3. Ablation studies highlighted the importance of incorporating various loss terms in the proposed graph auto-encoder model, demonstrating their critical role in enhancing data representation quality."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. While Spotscape demonstrated significant improvements in spatial domain identification across two Visium datasets(DLPFC and MTG), its performance on the Stereo-seq platform for mouse embryo profiling showed only modest gains compared to existing algorithms, such as domain detection with STAGATE (Fig. 3B) and batch correction with STAligner (Table 4). This difference may stem from the higher resolution of Stereo-seq (0.2 \u00b5m per spot) compared to Visium\u2019s lower resolution (55 \u00b5m per spot). The higher resolution likely enhances cell type and spatial domain identification, potentially diminishing Spotscape's advantage. With rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics profiling\u2014improving resolution, gene coverage, and sensitivity\u2014Spotscape must demonstrate strength across both low-resolution platforms like Visium and high-resolution platforms like Stereo-seq, seqFISH+, Pixel-seq, etc., to contribute significantly to spatial data analysis. \n2. While the inclusion of prototypical contrastive learning loss in Spotscape may improve spatial domain prediction, it could potentially impact other downstream tasks, such as trajectory prediction across cell types or states. \n3. Several parameters, such as learning rate, number of clusters (K), and lambda values for each loss term, appear hardcoded in the provided code. It is unclear how to optimize these parameters for new datasets and whether a comprehensive search for optimal values is required. Additionally, it raises questions about the time needed for this process, especially for large datasets containing 40\u2013100 spatial transcriptomics samples. \n4. It is worth noting that single-cell embedding models like scGPT and scFoundation, which are trained on millions of cells, have demonstrated superior performance in cell type clustering and data integration. A comparison between Spotscape and these pre-trained deep learning models on spatial transcriptomics data would be valuable to determine if Spotscape can outperform these models on the proposed tasks."

                "value": "In addition to the main weaknesses, there are a few minor points of clarification:\n1. In lines 40\u201342, the manuscript states, \"However, they fall short in predicting accurate clustering results due to the inherent noise in SRT data.\" Clustering does not inherently have a predefined \"accuracy.\" It would be clearer to specify accuracy in terms of cell type or brain layer annotation. \n2. In lines 48\u201349, the manuscript mentions that GNN methods have limitations, especially for spots around cell type cluster boundaries, and subsequently states that the STAGATE algorithm was developed to address this issue. However, STAGATE primarily addresses boundaries of brain layers, not cell types. Assigning cell types to Visium data is challenging, as each spot may contain multiple cells. Researchers often prefer cell type deconvolution or refer to clusters as \"cell type-enriched\" rather than assigning a single cell type to each spatial transcriptomics cluster for low resolution data. \n3. In lines 71\u201373, the manuscript states, \"where cells that are spatially close often exhibit strong feature similarity even when they serve different functions.\" To support this general statement, it would be helpful to reference a review paper rather than a figure to clarify whether this phenomenon is specific to the dataset used or is observed across multiple datasets. This may not universally apply to all datasets, as spatial transcriptomics profiling is widely used to detect cell type and tissue structure differences in various disease contexts."

The authors need to provide additional hyperparameter-sensitive analysis to justify this.\n\n3. It is not clear how the hyperparameters of the baseline methods are selected. The authors need to show that they made the best efforts to acquire the best performance from the baselines to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n4. The time complexity of this method is not clear. The prototypical contrastive learning objective involves T times of k-means in each training iteration (after 500 epochs), which may dramatically impact the running speed. The author needs to provide justification for the time-performance tradeoff."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The author mentions multiple times the statement that \"In biological systems, cells that are spatially close often exhibit strong feature similarity, regardless of their functional characteristics.\" Is there any literature to justify this? From my knowledge, this statement is misleading. The similarity only appears at the spot level, while at the cell level, for example, the Xenium data, the cell types locally close to each other are actually quite heterogeneous. Tumor micro-environment is one of the few exceptions where the local cells tend to share similar characteristics. I hope the authors are rigid when making statements about biology. \n\nMeanwhile, statements are causing confusion like this \"However, these approaches fall short in obtaining qualified spot representations, particularly for those located around the boundary of **cell type clusters**, as they heavily emphasize spatially local **spots** that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node.\" It mentions \"cell type clusters\" and \"local spots\" in the same time, while spots typically contain heterogeneous cell types, and they correspond to **spatial domain** instead of **cell type clusters**.\n\n2. \"Prototypical Contrastive Learning\" aims to enhance clustering and rare cell-type classification (I'm not sure how this benefits spot-level tasks). The idea is essentially similar to many previously established prototypical losses [1,2,etc]. However, I did not see any references in the paper. Should authors cite those methods or justify why they need to propose a different method?\n\n3. The authors proudly state that \"instead of relying on any predictor or stop gradient techniques, Spotscape simplifies the training procedure by employing a reconstruction loss\". To me, it is not clear how the reconstruction loss provides a better solution than the other options. It seems like the authors just blindly chose a shortcut for the implementation.\n\n[1] Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Representations, ICLR 2021\n[2] Population-level integration of single-cell datasets enables multi-scale analysis across samples, Nature Methods"

It\u2019s not surprising that graph contrastive learning can improve GNN\u2019s performance [1,2,3].

Besides, aligning representations across graph augmentations doesn\u2019t inherently enable access to information beyond local neighborhoods.\n- In the methodology, several alignment loss functions are proposed, but there appears to be redundancy. For example, both L_{sc} (Equ.(1)) and L_{pcl} aim to maximize the representation similarity between two augmentations. Additionally, as shown in Figure (7), removing L_{recon} and L_{pcl} doesn\u2019t actually impact the performance, raising the question of whether so many loss functions are necessary.\n- Several experimental details are missing, including the type of graph augmentation used, the specific hyperparameters, and the tuning strategy applied.\n- The explanation of Section 4.4 can be improved.

It is great that the authors showcase some interesting alignment results with mouse embryo slices and cross-technology alignment. For the mouse embryo slices, a more general baseline is (unbalanced) optimal transport, which typically performs pretty good in temporal alignment.
