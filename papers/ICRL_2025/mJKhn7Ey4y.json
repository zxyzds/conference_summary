    "title": "DIPPER: Direct Preference Optimization for Primitive-Enabled Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is an elegant framework for learning efficient control policies to perform complex robotic tasks, especially in sparse reward settings. However, concurrently learning policies at multiple hierarchical levels often suffers from training instability due to non-stationary behavior of lower-level primitives. In this work, we introduce DIPPER, an efficient hierarchical framework that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate non-stationarity at the higher level, while using reinforcement learning to train the corresponding primitives at the lower level. We observe that directly applying DPO to the higher level in HRL is ineffective and leads to infeasible subgoal generation issues. To address this, we develop a novel, principled framework based on lower-level primitive regularization of upper-level policy learning. We provide a theoretical justification for the proposed framework utilizing bi-level optimization. The application of DPO also necessitates the development of a novel reference policy formulation for feasible subgoal generation. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experimental analyses on a variety of challenging, sparse-reward robotic navigation and manipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that DIPPER shows impressive performance and demonstrates an improvement of up to 40% over the baselines in complex sparse robotic control tasks.",

                "value": "The authors propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) method that addresses two key problems in the literature: the non-stationary problem of training a high-level policy while a low-level policy is also changing, and the infeasible subgoal generation problem. The proposed method addresses these two issues by training the high-level policy with direct preference optimization (DPO) and setting the reference policy to be the low-level policy."

The authors present sufficient evidence that their formulation somewhat relieves the problem of infeasible goal generation (Fig. 4). \n\n- The results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than baseline HRL and non-HRL methods on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks.

For example, it's not immediately obvious that equation 6 and the accompanying explanation is referring to equation 5 and this should be made explicit. The small paragraphs \"Dealing with L1/L2\" are written in a confusing way and make it sound like the solution for dealing with these problems is about to be described next, whereas in fact the authors most likely wanted to convey that their bi-level optimization formulation and solution that was previously described alleviates both the issues. Overall this section could be written better and maybe accompanied with a diagram explaining the hierarchical policy and bi-level optimization problem formulation as a visual aid. \n\n- Figure 4 only compares subgoal distances to HIER, even though the authors include other HRL baselines in other experiments. Why weren't those comparisons made here as well? This seems a rather weak experiment to me."

To my understanding, the non-stationarity happens because of drastic changes in the higher-level and lower-level policies. Couldn't this be mitigated using trust region layers for reinforcement learning as presented in [2]? As a Value function is generally learned in RL, this would also mitigate Limitation 2 (infeasible goals).\n\nThose Trust region-based updates have been proposed to stabilize learning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning before [3,4] and, therefore, need to be discussed in the work. \n\n[2] Otto et al.

In the other environments, Dipper seems to perform better than existing baselines, but never seems to solve the task fully. In the \"pick and place\" and \"push\" task it only reaches a success rate of 0.3. Granted, the baselines perform even worse, but I find that result somewhat hard to believe. Perhaps the baselines were not configured adequately? It also seems like the non of the methods robustly converged to a certain level of performance."

This introduces a real bottleneck. How many preference trajectory pairs does dipper need to perform well, for example on the franka kitchen environment?  \n\nI am currently rating this paper a 5, but will raise my score if the concern regarding the performance of other baselines metrics is alleviated."

For example, the challenges they aim to solve in hierarchical RL are identical:\n\n\"The first (C1) is non-stationarity caused by evolving lower-level policies, which destabilizes the higher-level reward function (Chane-Sane et al., 2021). The second (C2) is the high-level policy\u2019s tendency to generate subgoals that are infeasible for the lower-level policy to achieve.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Limitation L1: non-stationarity due to evolving lower-level primitive policy, and Limitation L2: infeasible subgoal generation by higher-level policy(Chane-Sane et al., 2021). When the higher and lower level policies are trained concurrently in HRL, due to continuously changing and sub-optimal lower level policy, the higher level reward function and transition model become non-stationary.\"\n\nfrom the first paragraph of the introduction for both.\n\nFurthermore, their proposed solution is almost the same:\n\nWe propose a novel Hierarchical Preference Optimization (HPO) method that leverages primitiveregularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to solve complex RL tasks using human preference data (Section 4). Our approach is principled; we derive it by reformulating the HRL problem as a bi-level optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the bi-level optimization framework to develop a principled solution for HRL.\n\nand\n\n\"The key idea underlying DIPPER is twofold: we introduce a DPO-based approach to directly learn higher-level policies from preferences, replacing the two-tier RLHF component in the scheme described above with a simpler, more efficient single-tier approach; we replace the reference policy inherent in DPO-based approaches, which is typically unavailable in complex robotics tasks, with a primitive-enabled reference policy derived from a novel bi-level optimization formulation of the HRL problem.\"\n\nThe resulting \"novel\" solution for the procedure proposed is in Eq 13 in this paper and Eq 15 in the other, and are exactly identical.\n\nFinally, the experiment figures are almost identical, with near-identical performance between the two methods introduced in the two papers comparing against an identical set of baselines on an identical set of environments. This by itself isn't strange, but the near-identical performance points to how these methods are essentially the same. I believe it's the same authors too, as they cite the same paper (Singh et al 2024) as the main prior work they build upon, with the same art style for all figures.\n\nThe main differences between the two papers:\n\n{0, 1} (this paper) reward for the low level policy vs {-1, 0} (the other paper) reward\nThe use of human preferences vs substituting them with environment-generated preferences.\nI think this should be one paper, ablating the single choice of preferences vs environment-generated preferences. I don't believe they are sufficiently different to create two papers for."
