    "title": "Scene Flow as a Partial Differential Equation",
    "abstract": "We reframe scene flow as the task of estimating a continuous space-time PDE that describes motion for an entire observation sequence, represented with a neural prior. Our method, _EulerFlow_, optimizes this neural prior estimate against several multi-observation reconstruction objectives, enabling high quality scene flow estimation via pure self-supervision on real-world data. EulerFlow works out-of-the-box without tuning across multiple domains, including large-scale autonomous driving scenes and dynamic tabletop settings. Remarkably, EulerFlow produces high quality flow estimates on small, fast moving objects like birds and tennis balls, and exhibits emergent 3D point tracking behavior by solving its estimated PDE over long-time horizons. On the Argoverse 2 2024 Scene Flow Challenge, EulerFlow outperforms _all_ prior art, surpassing the next-best _unsupervised_ method by more than 2.5x, and even exceeding the next-best _supervised_ method by over 10%.",

                "value": "This paper proposes to represent scene flow as a velocity field using a neural prior. Instead of prior art that directly represents per-pair scene flow as neural prior, the authors alternatively propose to use neural prior to model the partial differential equation (PDE) of the position of the point versus the time interval. This novel velocity representation is interesting and could offer flexibility in dealing with long-term sequences of flow estimations as the authors described in the paper. The authors have also done extensive analysis of the proposed method on Argoverse 2 (and Waymo) datasets, comparing the performance with recent scene flow works, and validating the good performance of the proposed method."

Given that the representation is a continuous neural network, how does it extrapolate to a longer sequence with the current representation?\n- When comparing with a method like NSFP, I wondered if the authors could show the results of pure Euler integration of the method and highlight the benefits of wrapping a PDE with a neural network.\n- The authors mentioned that they only do sequences of length 20, I wondered if the method failed rapidly with the increase of the sequence length. It would be interesting to show an even longer sequence to highlight the arbitrary time query property of the proposed method.\n- I feel like the authors want to talk about too many things in this paper, so they may overlook the most important part of the method. This method is good at dealing with long-term flow trajectory and has the potential to better capture the small, highly dynamic objects in the scene. The authors could reorganize the motivations and experiments to highlight the advantages of the proposed method."

However, it is strange to see that using the Gaussian non-linear function is yielding very bad performance. Perhaps the spectral width needs to be fine-tuned, especially when the distribution of the lidar scene flow is very unique.\n\nPlease also see the above section for detailed comments."

The paper title and introduction is very general and does not provide a precise position of this paper's main contribution. \"Scene flow a partial differential equation\" has been historically formulated long time ago in many prior paper, e.g. [1] as one examplar reference, and it has been proposed as a continuous representation in one early seminal work [2]. Many related work studied this optimization problem using images input and solved it using differential optimization approaches before. In this paper seems only consider related work in the point cloud space, and beneficially solved in using a neural representation. I will suggests to more precise position their scope and contributions  in paper title, introduction and contributions. \n\n2. The evaluation dataset in this paper is mostly on autonomous driving datasets though as the method demonstrated, it should also work on other data domain when depth is available. Though real world depth and flow ground  truth is hard to get, it won't be too hard if evaluated using a more general synthetic dataset that provide different motion patterns, compared to the type of motion and accuracy that autonomous driving dataset can provide. \n\n3. The paper has already discussed the main limitations it section 6.1. Particularly for the last point \"EulerFlow does not understand ray casting geometry\", it was clear how this has been demonstrated in the current results. It will be good if the authors can provide examples and metrics that reflect the challenge in this aspect.\n\n[1] A Variational Method for Scene Flow Estimation from Stereo Sequences, Frederic Huguet and Frederic Devernay, ICCV 2007\n\n[2] Three dimensional scene flow, Vedula et al, CVPR 1999"

However, $\\frac{\\partial L^*}{\\partial t}$ alone is not a PDE yet, unless it is set equal to something (as in equation 2).\n2) I guess that in equation 2 SFvPDE should also depend on $x$. Could the authors clarify this?\n3) In general, it would be nice to have more formal definitions. E.g. in EulerFlow, an exact formula for solving the PDE, $\\text{Euler}_\\theta(P_t, d, k)$, would improve understanding and reproducibility of the method.\n4) In principle, the PDE can be integrated in both directions by simply reverting the time. The usage of the direction as an extra argument in the model makes the connection between sections 3 and 4 slightly weaker and seems to be a legacy design choice from NSFP. Thus, a question to the authors is whether they have tried training without the direction argument?\n5) Given the high computational complexity of the method, it would be better to see some implementation details on how exactly equation 3 is calculated during training. Are any optimizations already incorporated? E.g. in the current form separate terms in the loss are independent. However, I believe that subsequent Euler steps can use previous estimates instead of recalculating them.\n6) More ablation studies would better highlight the contributions of the paper. E.g. how general and how sensitive is the method to different numerical solvers and sizes of discretization steps? Have the authors tried higher-order PDE solvers or using $\\Delta t$ smaller than the time between observations?\n\nI will adjust my score based on the other reviews and the rebuttal by the authors."
