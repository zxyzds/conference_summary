    "title": "Poisson-Dirac Neural Networks for Modeling Coupled Dynamical Systems across Domains",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great success in modeling dynamical systems, providing data-driven simulators to predict complex phenomena, even without known governing equations. However, existing models have two major limitations: their narrow focus on mechanical systems and their tendency to treat systems as monolithic. These limitations reduce their applicability to dynamical systems in other domains, such as electrical and hydraulic systems, and to coupled systems. To address these limitations, we propose Poisson-Dirac Neural Networks (PoDiNNs), a novel framework based on the Dirac structure that unifies the port-Hamiltonian and Poisson formulations from geometric mechanics. This framework enables a unified representation of various dynamical systems across multiple domains as well as their interactions and degeneracies arising from couplings. Our experiments demonstrate that PoDiNNs offer improved accuracy and interpretability in modeling unknown coupled dynamical systems from data.",

These more baseline (non-NN) methods are simply not talked about or considered and I think they should be.\n\nThere are statements that are simply not true:  \"two key limitations remain in modeling dynamical systems, especially those described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The first limitation is the narrow focus on mechanical systems.\"  This suggests the authors don't know the field well and it is a concern.  People are modeling all kinds of dynamical systems with ML/AI architectures well beyond mechanical systems.\n\nFurther: \"The second limitation is that most methods treat the system as a single, monolithic entity.\"  This is also not true.  Many people are working on coupled systems where time-delay embeddings are often used to gather information for missing, coupled and unmeasured variables.  Again, it is odd that these statements exist in the paper which suggests the authors are not aware of the great body of work on model discovery and dynamical systems methods with ML/AI for systems which are not mechanical and which indeed have coupling."

If so, more standard system ID or linear methods should be considered instead of all this sophisticated ML/AI architectures.  \n\nCan this generalize to nonlinear models?  Or simply be applied to nonlinear models with success?  Although you did Fitzhugh-Nagumo and  Chua's model, these are only \"slightly\" nonlinear and system ID models can work pretty well with those.\n\nWhat have you not considered non-neural network methods like DMD... or system ID methods like mamba/S4 not been compared?"

Specifically, Remark 1 explains the representation of inter-coupling using a bivector element (which is also an NN, right?) Remark 4 with Table 2 briefly demonstrates the scenarios to capture coupled physics in multiple domains. The reviewer would like to know how PoDiNNs represent such interactions.  Is it the same way as the traditional simulation tool, e.g., through iterative refinement of two (or more) simulations of a single domain or system? \n\n\u2022\tThe proposed work targets unknown physics/dynamics, which is quite challenging as there are no predefined physical symbolics in PINN-alike works. How to ensure the PoDiNNs capture the correct physics without causing overfitting problem or continuous good performance in extrapolation?\n\n\u2022\tMoreover, PoDiNNs focus on behaviors that may not be captured by generic models, e.g., NODE, which seem to need intensive resources. Especially, the couplings in multi-physics usually require heavy computation in traditional simulations. The more fine-grained, the heavier. What is PoDiNNs\u2019 capability in this aspect?\n\n\u2022\tFor the last paragraph of Sec. 3.4, an example of electric circuit is used. Could the reviewer further explain with more details: why ODEs or using NODE alone cannot capture the current flow and balanced voltage level? Subsequently, how does PoDiNN mitigate the issue of limited representation? A toy example with mathematical derivations or diagram will be helpful."

Over the recent years, several neural network simulation models have been proposed among which Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) and Lagrangian Neural Networks. Although these models are formulated along physics principles and consequently enjoy improved stability of their simulations, two key limitations remain: (1) they focus on mechanical systems, as opposed to for example electric circuits or magnetic fields, and (2) they consider the system as a single monolithic entity. To alleviate these limitations, this work proposes Poisson-Dirac Neural Networks (PoDiNNs), which unifies the port-Hamiltonian and Poisson representations, and explicitly represents the coupling between internal and external components. The empirical evaluation shows that PoDiNNs enjoy stability over longer simulation horizons and in general achieve lower errors than Neural ODE or variants of HNNs.\n\nUnfortunately, I am missing too much of the mathematics and physics background that is required to understand the paper, so I am unable to provide an informative review."

Neural ODEs were originally found to have significant limitations in modelling dynamics long-term due to a lack of physical guarantees (e.g. conservation laws) leading to error accumulation. To address this, Hamiltonian NNs incorporate Hamiltonian mechanics (modelling the hamiltonian through a NN). This paper contributes a generalization of Hamiltonian NNs; Poinsson-Dirac Neural Networks (PoDiNNs) to combine both port-hamiltonian and poisson systems for mechanics, enabling learning of coupled dynamical systems across multiple domains, their interactions and degeneracies. This  constitutes a unification of previous works that address/leverage specific properties of dynamical systems like energy dissipation and external inputs. Authors show that this approach moreover allows for the identification of the specific coupling patterns between interacting dynamical systems. The experimental results show clear and consistent improvements over previous approaches in a range of systems with degenerate dynamics (e.g. constraints), dissipation and external inputs."

Although in places authors elaborate on their arguments with examples, I think it would be good to provide some more visual guidance. For example, figure 1 contains a very high-level overview of the concept of PoDiNNs, but I think it would be good to expand this diagram and clearly indicate what parts of this system the method proposes to replace with learned functions (NNs) and relate it to e.g. eq 5, def 3. I think this would greatly help with readability.\n- The experiments chosen by the authors are examples of systems that fit the modelling criteria set by the authors for their framework. In these settings, the proposed framework outperforms previous approaches. However, I think it would also be good to consider/experiment with settings that do not exhibit e.g. degeneracy just to gauge how well this generalized method works in the settings that the originally proposed HNN and LNN are validated on. Would it for example be possible to show performance of your model vs baselines on eg double pendulum (as in HNN or LNN paper)?\n- For completeness I think it is important to compare your method against the baselines also in terms of computational complexity / overhead. Currently, no details on the computational complexity or time complexity on either training or inference of the proposed method are given. Please provide these details.\n- An arguable weakness of the method is the reliance on specifying problem-specific constraints, i.e. the number of components is a model hyperparameter, but as shown in the last experiment / Appx E it is important to specify this to at least the number of underlying components in the system, or performance will be significantly impacted. Overspecifying is possible of course, and does not seem to have negative impact, but induces additional computational complexity."
