    "title": "Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first-stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM as the base generator, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while maintaining superior generation quality than that achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.",

                "value": "The paper, titled \"Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation\" (GeoRCG), presents a novel approach to improving molecular generative models by incorporating geometric representation conditions. The GeoRCG framework divides the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on this representation.\n\nThe core idea is to first generate a compact geometric representation of a molecule using a pre-trained geometric encoder. This representation captures essential information about molecular structure without the complexity associated with 3D symmetries, making the generation task simpler and more effective. Leveraging this representation, the second stage uses a molecule generator to produce the final molecule. The framework employs EDM as the base generator and shows significant improvements in both unconditional and conditional molecule generation tasks. Specifically, GeoRCG achieves an average 31% performance gain over state-of-the-art methods on challenging conditional generation tasks."

                "value": "The key strength of GeoRCG lies in its innovative use of geometric representations to condition molecular generation. By transforming the generation problem into a two-stage process\u2014first generating a geometric representation and then generating the molecule conditioned on this representation\u2014the paper introduces an effective way to simplify the complex task of molecular generation. This approach addresses major challenges like handling 3D geometric symmetries and provides a significant improvement over existing methods that attempt to directly learn molecular distributions.\n\nThe clear and structured presentation of the methodology, supported by well-executed empirical evaluations and visual explanations, adds to the clarity and accessibility of the paper. GeoRCG's advancements could have a significant impact on drug discovery and material design, highlighting its importance for both research and practical applications."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the paper emphasizes the use of geometric representations to simplify the generation task, there is insufficient analysis of how different pre-trained encoders impact the overall quality of the generated molecules. The choice of pre-trained encoders (UniMol and Frad) is central to the approach, but the authors do not explore how variations in the pre-training dataset or encoder architecture affect the representations. Conducting a more comprehensive analysis, such as comparing multiple pre-trained models trained on different datasets or architectures, would help clarify the impact of representation quality and improve confidence in the method\u2019s robustness.\n\n\nThe representation generator aims to remove symmetries such as O(3) and S(N), but the impact of symmetry removal on downstream tasks is not thoroughly analyzed. Specifically, it would be beneficial to explore whether there are specific symmetries that contribute positively to certain molecular properties or whether removing all symmetries has unintended negative effects on some downstream applications. Conducting ablation studies that selectively preserve certain symmetry properties could offer insights into how symmetry affects molecule generation and provide a more nuanced understanding of its role.\n\nIn the conditional generation setting, the paper discusses training the representation generator on (molecule, property) pairs. However, this strategy is limited to simple properties like HOMO-LUMO gap, polarizability, etc., and there is no clear extension for complex properties such as molecular binding affinity or ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties. Such properties typically require more context or knowledge beyond geometric structure alone. Addressing this limitation, either by discussing possible extensions or incorporating more sophisticated conditioning mechanisms (e.g., using multi-modal data such as 3D structure and protein targets), would make GeoRCG more applicable to real-world drug discovery problems."

                "value": "The paper presents a theoretical foundation and specific implementation of latent diffusion for molecular generation. Instead of directly operating with molecular graphs (e.g., continuous Euclidean coordinates and categorical atom types), the method proposes projecting molecules into a latent space and using latent representations that are O(3) and SO(3) invariant. Diffusion is performed in this simplified latent space, and then the molecules are reprojected to predict their structures. This approach reduces computational costs, resulting in a denoising neural network that is much smaller and simpler, as well as reducing the number of steps required for diffusion."

In this paper, the authors demonstrated that they were able to reduce the number of diffusion steps from the commonly used 1000 or 500 to just 100 without any performance drop. Performing diffusion in a simpler latent representation appears to be a highly effective approach.\n\nBetter Bond Length and Angle Distributions on QM9 Dataset: The proposed model generates bond length and bond angle distributions that more closely resemble those of the QM9 dataset. This is a reasonable metric for assessing the quality of generated 3D structures and indicates an improvement over previous methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Limited 3D Metrics on Larger Datasets: The only reported 3D metric for the more realistic and larger GEOM Drugs dataset is atom stability. Since the atom stability is only 0.86 for GEOM Drugs itself, this raises questions about the reliability of the metric. A more comprehensive and accurate comparison is required to fully assess the model\u2019s performance on larger datasets.\n\nOverlooking Models That Do Not Rely on External Software: The paper states that models such as MiDi and LDM3DG use domain knowledge through Open Babel, which gives them advantages. However, there are models like JODO, EQGATDiff, and SemlaFlow that directly predict bonds without relying on external software. Including these models in comparisons would provide a more comprehensive evaluation and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method.\n\nQuestionable Reliance on Lookup Tables: The reliance on a lookup table for bond lengths is questionable. Depending on the molecular configuration and the specific energy calculation method used (which is GFN2-xTB for GEOM Drugs), bond lengths can vary within a 10% interval. This variability suggests that a static lookup table may not accurately capture the nuances of bond lengths across different molecules.\n\nLack of Comparison with Faster Models: While the method aims for faster molecule generation by reducing the number of diffusion steps, previous models have already utilized flow matching to reduce steps to 200 (EquiFM) or even 20 (SemlaFlow). Including these models in the comparison would strengthen the research by providing context for the improvements and demonstrating how the proposed method stands relative to existing fast-generation techniques."

A comparison with these models, especially SemlaFlow due to its speed and reduced number of steps, could be particularly beneficial in highlighting the advantages and limitations of your approach.\n\nIn the paper, there is no reference to the GEOM paper, and there is a claim: \u201cCrucially, many structures in GEOM-DRUG lack the equilibrium conditions necessary for pre-training methods that enable effective learning of force fields,\u201d which could be misleading.
