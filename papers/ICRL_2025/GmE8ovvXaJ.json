    "title": "Selective State-Space Modeling of Correlation Maps for Semantic Correspondence",
    "abstract": "Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance visual features but may miss complex inter-image relationships, while recent correlation-metric approaches attempt to model these relationships but are hindered by high computational costs due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs), treating multi-level correlation scores as states. By implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba\u2019s linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation tensor effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field. Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance without relying on large input images or computationally expensive diffusion-based feature extractors, effectively capturing rich inter-image correlations while maintaining computational efficiency.",

                "value": "This paper proposes MambaMatcher, a Mamba-based approach to establish semantic correspondences. MambaMatcher attempts to model inter-image correlations by treating multi-level correlation scores at each position in the correlation map as a state in a state-space model. Specifically, the multi-level features obtained by the frozen extractor are first enhanced through feature aggregation. The enhanced features are used to construct a multi-level correlation map. Then, the correlation map is refined with the proposed similarity-aware selective scan mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaMatcher achieves a good balance between accuracy and efficiency in establishing semantic correspondences."

                "value": "**1. The core design of MambaMatcher, i.e., treating the correlation scores at each position in the correlation map as a state in a state-space model, seems to provide only a minor benefit.**\n\nAccording to the results in Table 4 and Table 5, the combination of a DINOv2 feature extractor, a 2D-Conv_{k=5} feature aggregation and the existing correlation aggregation processes (based on 4D-Conv or FastFormer) provide a similar accuracy compared with the proposed MambaMatcher. This phenomenon indicates that the selection of feature extractors and the design of single-image feature aggregation may be more significant problems in establishing semantic correspondences. Replacing the existing 4D-Conv or FastFormer with the Mamba structure in the correlation aggregation process just gives a small improvement. Such a performance decreases the significance of the motivation and the core design in this paper.\n\n**2. Some claims in this paper are not discussed clearly.**\n\n2.1. In Line 48, the authors claim that one problem of the existing correlation-metric approaches is that they \u201cseverely limit the feature map resolution\u201d. However, the proposed MambaMatcher only processes the 30x30 feature map. Could we consider the 30x30 size as a large resolution? Maybe more experiments are required to validate MambaMatcher\u2019s superiority in handling larger feature maps.\n\n2.2. In Line 69, the authors claim that \u201cMambaMatcher seamlessly integrates feature-metric and correlation-metric approaches into a unified pipeline.\u201d It indicates that some parts of MambaMatcher are feature-metric-based while some are correlation-metric-based. However, there is no discussion to clarify such a claim.\n\n**3. The introduction of the proposed \u201csimilarity-aware selective scan mechanism\u201d is not clear enough.**\n\nThe first reason of this problem is that Figure 2 is not cited in the main text. Besides, some equations may make the process of \u201csimilarity-aware selective scan mechanism\u201d clearer."

The novelty of the approach appears limited, as the correlation structure used in this method closely resembles that of CAT++, raising concerns about its originality.\n3.

Specifically, how does this differ from identifying semantic similarities across local pixels within an image, and why is it particularly challenging for feature-metric methods to capture these relationships?\n3. The results in Table 1 have inconsistent resolutions, making it necessary to compare them at the same resolution to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n4. Figure 5 is somewhat difficult to interpret, as it\u2019s unclear what the red and green points represent.

                "value": "1. The content in Sec 4.2 MULTI-LEVEL CORRELATION COMPUTATION AND AGGREGATION is somewhat ambiguous. The overall process flow should be: Shape the correlation map from 4D to 1D -> order -> reorder -> reshape  the correlation map  from 1D to 4D. Is the sorting performed along the $H \\times W \\times H \\times W$ dimension or along the $2L$ dimension? If it is along the $H \\times W \\times H \\times W$ dimension, is the sorting directly based on similarity in descending order? How are the potential spatial relationships between correlation elements encoded?\n\n2. Similarity-aware Selective Scanning: Mamba relies on its inherent order to capture the relative positional relationships between sequence tokens. When  correlation elements are sorted by similarity before scanning, does this mean  no longer need to consider the spatial locations of these elements? \n\n3. Parameters of Feature Aggregation: Line 215 states that \"The feature aggregators share the same weights across all levels to maintain efficiency.\" However, Lines 320-322 describe the feature aggregation layer as consisting of two layers of 2D convolution with a kernel size of 5, with output channel dimensions of 64 and 14, respectively, and a ReLU activation function in between. This implies that feature aggregation includes four 2D convolutional layers and two ReLU activations. However, in Table 6, feature aggregation is reported to have 42.5M parameters, which appears inconsistent. Please provide a more detailed explanation."

Section 4.1 introduces Multi-level Feature Aggregation using a lightweight 2D convolution network, while Section 4.2 proposes MULTI-LEVEL CORRELATION COMPUTATION AND AGGREGATION using Mamba. Both aggregation modules require training, but throughout the text, the authors often refer to \u201cthe aggregation\u201d without specifying which aggregation they mean. This lack of clarity can easily lead to confusion, as in Lines 251-352: \u201cWe freeze the visual feature extractor during training to focus on learning the aggregation layers.\u201d Here, does \u201cthe aggregation layers\u201d refer to the feature aggregation in Section 4.1, the correlation aggregation in Section 4.2, or both?\n\n2.Effects of selective scan order. Table 5 indicates that the relative order of correlation elements significantly impacts performance, with ascending order notably reducing effectiveness compared to descending order. This may be because, in causal inference, later tokens pass information to all preceding tokens. Placing high-similarity tokens at the beginning can help reduce interference from other correlation elements. The paper briefly claims that \"Early processing of strong matches helps resolve ambiguities in these regions,\" in Sec. 4.2, but a more in-depth analysis is needed."
