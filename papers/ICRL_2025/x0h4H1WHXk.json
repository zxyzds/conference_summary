    "title": "Image Restoration for Training Data Reconstructed from Trained Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Haim et al. [NeurIPS 2022] propose a method to reconstruct training data from trained neural networks with impressive results. While their reconstructed images resemble the original training images, most of them also contain a considerable amount of noise and artifacts. This is especially true, when the network was trained on more than just a few dozen images. To address this, we view the problem as a specific image restoration task. Since the noise and artifacts are different from other types of noise (Gaussian noise, compression artifacts, blurring, or impulse noise from digital cameras), we create a new dataset specifically for the restoration of images produced by the reconstruction process proposed by Haim et al. We use this dataset consisting of about 60 million noisy reconstructions of CIFAR-10 images to train a diffusion model on the restoration task. Using this method, we obtain reconstructions that are significantly closer to the original training images measured in terms of SSIM and HaarPSI scores.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a method to enhance image quality in reconstructions obtained through model inversion attacks. Building on prior work by Haim et al. (2022), which demonstrated methods for reconstructing training data from a model, the authors introduce a conditional diffusion model to remove the substantial noise and artifacts typically present in these reconstructions. By training the model on a large dataset of approximately 60 million CIFAR-10 images with artificially introduced noise and distortions, the method produces reconstructions that are visually closer to the original images. Evaluation metrics like SSIM and HaarPSI indicate that the restored images significantly improve in fidelity compared to both the noisy reconstructions and results obtained from general-purpose denoising tools."

The primary limitation of this paper is its focus on CIFAR-10, a small, low-resolution dataset, which raises questions about the model's scalability to larger, higher-resolution datasets. While CIFAR-10 serves as an effective test case for early experiments, it is unclear whether this method can generalize to complex, high-resolution datasets like ImageNet.\n\n2. Figure 1 only provides visual results, making it difficult to objectively assess the improvements claimed by the restoration model. Including quantitative metrics, such as SSIM and PSNR scores.\n\n3. Figure 1 would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison that includes results from both classic image restoration methods, such as SwinIR, and advanced diffusion-based models like Stable Diffusion. \n\n4. Although the paper claims to utilize a dataset of 60 million images, only a fraction of these images actually yield usable reconstructions due to the inherent limitations of the data generation process. \n\n5. How sensitive is the restoration performance to different initialization parameters in the diffusion model?"

Second, only the confidently matched ones are preserved. How about the examples that are hard to be inversed from the network?\n\n2, Since the dataset is constructed from the \u201canimals v.s. vehicles\u201d task. All the pairs are either animals or vehicles. Can the trained model extend to other types of data for the subsequent restoration task?"

The problem is important because reconstructing training data from trained neural networks has implications for data privacy leakage. This work is inspired by a previous work by Haim et al. The main contribution is to improve the image reconstruction quality. To achieve the goal, the authors first generated a large-scale dataset that consists of paired clean images and \"noisy\" images based on the method proposed by Haim et al. and the CIFAR10 dataset. Then the authors trained a diffusion model and a normal CNN to reconstruct the \"noisy\" images."

There is a major flaw in the method: to train the diffusion model or the CNN to enhance the \"noisy\" images, the clean ground-truth images have been already used as the target in the loss function. In the practical training-data reconstruction attack proposed by Haim et al., the clean ground-truth images are not known or seen. Does this mean information leakage to the diffusion model or the CNN? \n\n2. The contribution of this paper is too limited. The data simulation pipeline is mainly from the paper by Haim et al. Although the authors made some modifications to speed up the simulation, this is too trivial. The major contribution is using a diffusion model to enhance the reconstructed images, which as mentioned above has major flaws."

This is important since it indicates an even more important problem about data privacy."
