    "title": "AttriBoT: A Bag of Tricks for Efficiently Approximating Leave-One-Out Context Attribution",
    "abstract": "The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a 300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response $30\\times$ faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.",

                "value": "* The paper presents a novel approach, AttriBoT, for efficiently approximating the Leave-One-Out (LOO) error in context attribution for large language models (LLMs). The idea of using cached activations to avoid redundant operations is highly original. By caching the attention key and value tensors at each layer, the method significantly reduces the computational cost, which is a new way of addressing the inefficiency issue in computing LOO attributions. This has not been explored in such a comprehensive manner in previous works.\n* In the context of the increasing use of LLMs, understanding how the model generates its output based on the input context is crucial. The work on context attribution, especially the proposed AttriBoT method, is highly significant as it enables more efficient analysis of the influence of each context span on the LLM's generations. This has practical implications in various applications such as improving the reliability and safety of LLMs by detecting malicious prompts and model hallucinations.\n* The hierarchical attribution technique is a novel addition. The assumption that the sum of the LOO attributions for $k$ contiguous text spans can be approximated by a single Leave-$k$-Out attribution score is an innovative concept. This allows for a reduction in the number of forward passes required for attribution computation, especially in hierarchical contexts like paragraphs and sentences."

                "value": "__theoretical analysis__\n* For the similarity assumption between the proxy model and the target model, the paper mainly proves it by experimentally measuring the correlation, but does not deeply explore the stability and limitations of this similarity assumption under different model architectures and training data distributions. In some cases, the small proxy model may not accurately capture the complex behavior of the large target model, leading to deviations in the attribution results.\n\n__generalization__\n* Investigate the adaptability of the method to different model architectures. Consider testing on models with different architectural designs (such as models with different attention mechanisms, non - Transformer-based models) to see if the proposed techniques can be generalized or need to be adjusted. This will provide more comprehensive guidance for the application of the method in the broader field of LLMs.\n\n__evaluation and baselines__\n* Explore ways to integrate context attribution results into the human-machine interaction process. For example, design a feedback mechanism that provides users with context attribution information when they receive a response from the LLM, helping them to better understand the basis of the model's answer and guiding them to ask more effective questions. This can improve the overall user experience and the effectiveness of using LLMs.\n* The choice of baselines is relatively limited. Although several common methods are included, there may be other emerging or less well-known methods that could provide a more comprehensive comparison. Additionally, the baselines may not cover all possible alternative approaches, leaving room for a more thorough evaluation of the novelty and superiority of the AttriBoT method."

In the Approximation Error part. The paper focus on only a few highly contributive sources, which may overlook the cumulative effect of less influential spans. This approach might limit the method's generalizability, especially in cases where there isn't a clear distinction between highly and moderately contributive sources. It would be better to evaluate your method recovering few highly cotributive sources and full sources on datasets like HotpotQA to verify the rationality.\n\n4.

While consistent results are observed across the three datasets, does the Pareto-optimal outcome have corresponding theoretical support?\n\n2. In Section 4.1.1, the authors introduce two target models, the Llama3.1 series and the Qwen 2.5 series, for evaluating the AttriBoT method. Can this method be applied to closed-source large models? Additionally, is it applicable to LLMs with architectures other than Transformers?\n\n3. As a general approach, the authors mention the broad applications of context attribution, but only use OBQA for data. Can the effectiveness of the proposed method be further validated in other contexts or task types?"
