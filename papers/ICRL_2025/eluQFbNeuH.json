    "title": "BetterBodies: Reinforcement Learning guided Diffusion for Antibody Sequence Design",
    "abstract": "Antibodies offer great potential for the treatment of various diseases. However, the discovery of therapeutic antibodies through traditional wet lab methods is expensive and time-consuming. The use of generative models in designing antibodies therefore holds great promise, as it can reduce the time and resources required. Recently, the class of diffusion models has gained considerable traction for their ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality samples. In their basic form, however, they lack mechanisms to optimize for specific properties, such as binding affinity to an antigen. In contrast, the class of offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods has demonstrated strong performance in navigating large search spaces, including scenarios where frequent real-world interaction, such as interaction with a wet lab, is impractical. Our novel method, BetterBodies, which combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with offline RL guided latent diffusion, can generate novel sets of antibody CDRH3 sequences from different data distributions. Furthermore, we reflect biophysical properties in the VAE latent space using a contrastive loss and add a novel Q-function based filtering to enhance the affinity of generated sequences. Using the Absolut! simulator, we demonstrate that BetterBodies generates sequences with improved binding affinity to the SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain and matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art method Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet). In conclusion, our method has the potential for great implications in real-world biological sequence design, where the generation of novel high-affinity binders is a cost-intensive endeavor.",

                "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a framework to generate CDRH3 sequences with improved binding affinities to important receptors. In particular, the framework first pre-trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to map each amino acid in CDRH3 sequences to a latent embedding. It then learns a diffusion model that sequentially generates these embeddings, which can be transformed back to amino acids, to construct the full CDRH3 sequences. To further improve the binding affinity, a Q function is trained to accurately estimate the Q-value for each action (i.e., each added amino acid), with previously added amino acids. This Q function is also used to guide the training of the diffusion model for better binding affinities. The experimental results show that the model can match or outperform the baseline."

In this paper, only CDRH3 sequences with 11 amino acids are considered, and variations in sequence length are not considered. With each amino acid having only 20 amino types, the search space, in the reviewer\u2019s opinion, is limited. Given that specific motifs may exist at different positions in CDRH3, a combination of three complicated models may not be necessary for this task.\n\n* It is suggested to include other state-of-the-art baselines for biological sequence design in the comparison. Currently, the paper uses only one baseline, which is not sufficient.\n\n* It is suggested to clearly explain the design choices and do extensive ablation studies to validate them. For example, it would be helpful to validate the importance of the VAE latent space and the use of diffusion models in the overall framework."

            "questions": {
                "value": "* The reviewer thinks this task is relatively simple. Given this simplicity, the reviewer thinks this complicated framework may not be necessary.  To validate the effectiveness of this framework, it is suggested that the authors add some simple search or optimization algorithms as baselines. For example, genetic algorithms, MCTS search algorithms, or even random policies, can also be used to generate novel CDRH3 sequences or mutate existing CDRH3 sequences for improved binding affinities. The reviewer wonders, within the same time constraints, whether these search or optimization algorithms can perform comparable or better than the proposed framework.\n\n* The rationale for using a VAE to learn a two-dimensional latent vector for each amino acid is unclear. Given that the input sequence has a fixed length of 11, the reviewer thinks it is not necessary to learn additional embeddings for each amino acid. \n\n* The rationale for using a diffusion model to generate each amino acid also requires further explanation. The reviewer thinks that determining the amino acid type based on previously generated sequences is not a complicated problem, especially given the short length of sequences and limited number of amino acid types. \n\n \n* It is suggested that more baselines [1,2] need to be added for a comprehensive comparison.

There is already a rich literature in the online setting for protein and antibody design, which should be referenced and contrasted against. One such example is Li, Lin, et al. \"Machine learning optimization of candidate antibody yields highly diverse sub-nanomolar affinity antibody libraries.\" Nature Communications 14.1 (2023): 3454. The main comparison is to GFlowNets, which is relevant insofar as the paper considers the offline RL setting, but the authors do not discuss or benchmark against any methods that are actually used in antibody design (i.e., methods that include wet lab validation).\nAntibodies are a leading class of drugs, but not only (or mainly) because of their binding properties."

                "value": "This paper brings up several points worth considering:\n- **Motivation**: The decision to use a 2-dimensional latent space in the VAE could be more clearly explained. While the authors suggest that combining VAE with contrastive learning can help group amino acids, it would be helpful to understand more specifically how this approach impacts model performance. Additionally, the rationale for a 2-dimensional space might benefit from further justification, as it may limit the ability to capture complex relationships. It seems that balancing high likelihood with predicted affinity might be possible using discrete diffusion alone, so more clarification on the essential role of the VAE component would be valuable.\n- **Novelty**: The proposed method draws on a combination of existing techniques. A more detailed discussion on how these elements uniquely contribute to antibody design could enhance the sense of novelty.\n- **Related Work**: Expanding the related work section to include notable antibody research from recent ML conferences (such as dWJS [1], AbODE [2], etc.) would strengthen the contextual foundation and illustrate the paper\u2019s position within the field.\n- **Experiment**: The experimental setup might benefit from including additional, recent baselines beyond GFlowNet [3], as several antibody-specific generative models have emerged in the past two years. Also, considering other evaluation tools like Rosetta or ML-based methods common in antibody research could provide more robust benchmarking. The Absolut! framework limits the evaluation to sequences of 11 residues, which might narrow the scope unnecessarily. Given these considerations, the current comparison could be enriched by including recent models or broader evaluation metrics.\n- **Writing**: The clarity could be improved by refining certain sections for conciseness. For example, the discussion on diffusion models in the opening of Section 4 could be streamlined to maintain focus on the methodology itself.\n\n---\n[1] Protein Discovery with Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling, Frey et al., ICLR 24  \n[2] AbODE: Ab Initio Antibody Design using Conjoined ODEs, Verma et al., ICML 23  \n[3] Biological sequence design with gflownets, Jain et al., ICML 22"
