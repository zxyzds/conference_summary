    "title": "Measuring Diversity: Axioms and Challenges",
    "abstract": "The concept of diversity is widely used in various applications: from image or molecule generation to recommender systems. Thus, being able to properly measure diversity is important. This paper addresses the problem of evaluating diversity for a set of objects. First, we make a systematic review of existing diversity measures and explore their undesirable behavior in some cases. Based on this review, we formulate three desirable properties (axioms) of a reliable diversity measure: monotonicity, uniqueness, and continuity. We show that none of the existing diversity measures has all three properties and thus these measures are not suitable for quantifying diversity. Then, we construct two examples of measures that have all the desirable properties, thus proving that the list of axioms is not self-contradicting. Unfortunately, the constructed examples are too computationally complex for practical use, thus we pose an open problem of constructing a diversity measure that has all the listed properties and can be computed in practice.",

                "value": "The paper discusses some theoretical aspects of various diversity measures. It suggests that common diversity measures, such as Vendi Score and Determinantal Point Process scores are optimized for computational simplicity rather than axiomatic optimality. They have potential drawbacks breaking some intuitive properties, such as monotonicity and uniqueness. The paper then proposes two measures: MultiDimVolume and IntegralMaxClique, which preserve all properties, despite being NP-hard to compute."

They appear closely related to hypervolume-based multiobjective optimization, dating back to 2012. Additional discussions are needed to clarify the connections to existing work and to refresh the claims of contributions.\n\nAnother weakness is a lack of experiments. Contrary to the author's conclusion, an NP-hard objective can be practical if the number of candidates are few. For example, it is possible to compute the MultiDimVolume of Top-K recommended items from a recommender system, provided that K is in the range of 100-1000. For an ICLR contribution, I would expect to see some empirical validation of the proposed methods.\n\nLastly, the discussion of DPP objective can be strengthened. It is unclear to me whether the violation of the monotonicity property can be a result of improper normalization or is it a fundamental flaw of the DPP objective. More discussions about the construction of the K-matrices (Line 210) would be helpful."

This could indicate an issue with the embedding rather than the diversity measurement method. Additionally, such a case seems relatively rare, and it might be reasonable to conduct experiments to verify its occurrence. 2) The description of the limitations of the existing method includes very stringent prerequisites (e.g., requiring 16 points to be located at the four corners of a unit square, as mentioned on line 142), which are difficult to justify as generally applicable. Additionally, the positions of these points in the feature space are closely related to the embedding computation.\n\nReference:\n[1] Leinster T, Cobbold C A.
