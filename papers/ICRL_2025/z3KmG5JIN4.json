    "title": "CodeCloak: A Method for Mitigating Code Leakage by LLM Code Assistants",
    "abstract": "LLM-based code assistants are becoming increasingly popular among developers.\nThese tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer\u2019s codebase. \nWhile beneficial, the use of these tools can inadvertently expose the developer\u2019s proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. \nIn this work, we propose a method to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. CodeCloak is a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service.\nCodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. \nOur evaluation, employing StarCoder and Code Llama, LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates CodeCloak\u2019s effectiveness on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models.\nWe also designed a method for reconstructing the developer\u2019s original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of CodeCloak under practical development scenarios.",

The reliance solely on edit distance may not effectively capture the semantic preservation of the code, which is crucial for assessing leakage risks.\n2. Table 1 is unclear as the best results are not consistently highlighted, and some indices show inferior performance compared to a random baseline, which is confusing.\n3. The concept of new leakage risks introduced by the authors lacks substantial support from prior studies. The paper fails to clarify how these risks are quantified and mitigated, particularly the risk of intent leakage, which is critical for understanding the effectiveness of CodeCloak.\n4. The criteria for code leakage are vague. The paper should clarify how it measures whether the intent behind the code has been leaked, considering that an adversary's ability to reconstruct the intent could still pose significant risks.\n\nMinor Comments:\nThere are several typographical errors that need correction to enhance clarity and professionalism. For instance, the term \"deep learning learning\" should be corrected to \"deep reinforcement learning.\""

                "value": "Major Strengths\n\n1. Timely response to an important issue: The paper addresses the growing concern of code leakage through LLM-based code assistants, a pertinent issue given the increasing adoption of such tools in development. CodeCloak\u2019s focus on prompt manipulation as a privacy-preserving mechanism is both timely and relevant.\n\n2. Direct and practical solution: The authors define the problem of code leakage through LLM prompts clearly and systematically approach it with DRL-based prompt manipulation. The solution, CodeCloak, is a streamlined method that operates locally without altering the assistant model, making it more practical for real-world applications.\n\nMinor Strengths\n\n1. Clear figure presentation: The figures are effectively used, especially the workflow and action selection heatmap, which illustrate the core operations of CodeCloak and the logic behind its prompt manipulations. These visuals enhance the clarity of the methodology.\n\n2. The design of developer simulator: The developer coding simulator is a thoughtful addition, simulating real-world coding behaviors like pauses, cursor movement, and typo corrections. This setup provides a controlled yet realistic environment for testing CodeCloak, making the results more relatable and grounded in practical usage\u200b.\n\n3. Multi-dimensional evaluation strategy: By employing CodeBLEU[1], GPT-based similarity measures, and user studies, the authors take a holistic approach to evaluation. This variety provides a solid foundation for assessing CodeCloak\u2019s ability to mitigate leakage without compromising functionality, making the claims more convincing.\n\n[1] Ren S, Guo D, Lu S, et al.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Major Weaknesses\n\n1. Limited technical contribution: While CodeCloak addresses a relevant problem, its technical novelty is limited, as it primarily combines established RL methods (specifically recurrent PPO [1]) with prompt manipulation techniques. This reliance on recurrent PPO introduces challenges, such as difficulty in reward modeling and a complex training pipeline. Additionally, selecting a specific RL algorithm may restrict the generality of the approach. Expanding the RL architecture or incorporating more advanced prompt adaptation methods could enhance the contribution and broaden its applicability.\n\n2. Over-reliance on similarity for effectiveness assessment: Relying solely on CodeBLEU for code similarity may not capture the full effectiveness of the method. CodeBLEU assesses syntactic and structural similarity, which could miss nuanced privacy risks. While PrivacyGPT and SugSimGPT provide insights into leakage and suggestion quality, PrivacyGPT may not fully evaluate the sensitivity of the leaked information, and SugSimGPT focuses on relevance rather than privacy-preserving quality. Adding targeted metrics for prompt leakage or sensitivity would provide a more complete evaluation of CodeCloak\u2019s impact.\n\n3. Inconsistent formula presentation: The mathematical expressions, especially around the reward function, could benefit from clearer notation and consistent formatting. Improving this aspect would make the technical approach more rigorous and easier to follow. For example:\n\n- The cumulative reward formula $G_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}$ lacks definitions for variables like $G_t$ and $R_{t+k+1}$.\n\n- The agent\u2019s action distribution formula is shown in the action heatmap, but it doesn\u2019t fully explain the state-action mapping, which is essential for understanding decision-making.\n\n- In Table 2, parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are used to balance relevance and leakage but lack explanation on how each impacts the model\u2019s outputs.\n\nThese can make the paper hard to follow and create confusion. Clearer notation and additional context would improve readability and technical rigor.\n\nMinor Weaknesses\n\n1. Repeated sentences and paragraphs: The paper contains multiple repetitions, particularly around the reward process, DRL modeling, and LLM choices (e.g., StarCoder[2] vs. Code Llama[3]). Streamlining these explanations could improve clarity and reduce redundancy.\n\n2. Possible issues in updating the DRL module: The paper mentions using PPO for the DRL agent but does not provide sufficient detail on how the module adapts to diverse prompt types. Expanding on how the DRL module handles varied developer prompts and how it recalibrates under different conditions would make the approach more robust and credible.\n\n[1] Pleines M, Pallasch M, Zimmer F, et al.

                "value": "My primary concern lies in the technical contribution of this work, particularly in the modeling approach. To clarify this aspect, I would appreciate if the authors could address the following questions:\n\n1. Could the authors elaborate on the specific innovations introduced in the DRL modeling process for CodeCloak beyond existing reinforcement learning techniques? For instance, how does the architecture adapt to unique challenges in privacy preservation for code prompts?\n\n2. How does CodeCloak\u2019s reward function balance code similarity with privacy protection, and was any tuning process developed to optimize this balance? Detailed insights into parameter selection and adjustments would be helpful (i.e., if more than a linear combination, what do you plan to change)\n\n3. Given the dependency on CodeBLEU and GPT-based metrics, did you consider alternative metrics tailored to privacy risk or sensitivity? If so, why were these not implemented, and how might future versions of CodeCloak address this gap?"
