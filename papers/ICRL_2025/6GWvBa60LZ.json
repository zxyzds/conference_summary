    "title": "A method for identifying causality in the response of nonlinear dynamical systems",
    "abstract": "Predicting the response of nonlinear dynamical systems subject to random, broadband excitation is important across a range of scientific disciplines, such as structural dynamics and neuroscience. Building data-driven models requires experimental measurements of the system input and output, but it can be difficult to determine whether inaccuracies in the model stem from modelling errors or noise.  This paper presents a novel method to identify the causal component of the input-output data from measurements of a system in the presence of output noise, as a function of frequency, without needing a high fidelity model. An output prediction, calculated using an available model, is optimally combined with noisy measurements of the output to predict the input to the system. The parameters of the algorithm balance the two output signals and are utilised to calculate a nonlinear coherence metric as a measure of causality. This method is applicable to a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. There are currently no solutions to this problem in the absence of a complete benchmark model.",

This estimate, termed $\\hat{y}$ is obtained by combining, in frequency domain, a model/input based estimate $y_z$, with the noisy data $y_n$ (similar to a Kalman filter). $Co(\\hat{y}, y_n)$ is closer to $Co(y, y_n)$, than an only model/input-based estimate $Co(y_z, y_n)$."

                "value": "1. I found the paper hard to read, I think this can be improved by the authors more clearly explaining or motivating their motivation for the different steps (which might be obvious to them, but might not be to the reader), e.g.,  \n    - 1.1 \u201cCausality\u201d is in the title and a key point of the paper, however I am totally missing some explicit motivation for why measuring coherence is the best way to estimate causality. The one citation for coherency (Silva et al., 2016), seems an odd choice.\n    - 1.2 ANR introduced, but it, and the cited papers seem only tangentially related. This could be scrapped to make space for motivating the actual method, i.e., the use of coherency.\n     - 1.3 No motivation is given for combining a model-based estimate with data in the frequency domain.\n     - 1.4 Altough $\\mathcal{F}$ of Eq. 1 is called a function, it is not a map from $x(t)$ to $y(t)$ (then there would be no dynamical system). Relatedly, it might also be better to use a different characters for $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_\\theta$, which are two very different things.\n\n2. I find it very confusing that the paper introduces, and keeps referring to non-linear coherence, when the paper really seems to be after estimating the \u201cstandard\u201d, linear coherence between $y$ and $y_n$. \n\n3. Page 9, has half its space dedicated to a Figure of an experimental setup, but this is just another benchmark, I would suggest to make this Figure smaller (or move it to appendix), and use the remaining space to improve readability.\n\n4. The only evaluation here is $Co(\\hat{y},y)$, against other coherences, which is not immediately intuitive. Could the authors not simply also plot and/or quantify how close $\\hat{y}$ is to $y$?\n\n5. Fig. 1 seems to lack a $\\hat{Y}$ before, and $\\hat{y}$ after the IFFT box. $X$ and a box with $\\mathcal{F}$ (with some parameters $\\theta$?) feeding into $y_z$ would also be helpful.\n\n6. I find the motivation for needing $\\mathcal{L}y$ and $\\lambda$ in general a bit lacking in theoretical foundations. A possible perspective could potentially be that Eq. 5 gives one the variational estimate of the true distribution of $y$ as $q(\\hat{y}|y_n, x)$,  $F_\\theta$ gives one $p(x|\\hat{y})$ as $\\mathcal{N}(x; F_\\theta(\\hat{y}), \\sigma_x^2)$. If one adds a prior on $\\hat{y}$ as p$(\\hat{y})=\\mathcal{N}(y_n, \\sigma_y^2)$ and writes out the typical ELBO loss on $p(x)$, both terms in Eq. 7 drop out (just the entropy of $q$ is missing) - although I am sure other perspectives are possible!"

If one wants to distinguish what combining the forward model with a data inferred state brings you, can one not simply take the forward model from section 3.3?\n2. Are the $\\dot{x}$ and $\\ddot{x}$ terms in Eq. 3 needed (they seem to be absent in all benchmarks)?\n3. Eq. 7, is there an implicit Gaussian assumption?\n4. Line 197 Why would $\\lambda=0$ yield the optimal $K$, this is not obvious to me?"
