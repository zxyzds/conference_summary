    "title": "GraphPINE: Graph importance propagation Neural Network for interpretable drug response prediction",
    "abstract": "Explainability is necessary for tasks that require a clear reason for a given result such as finance or biomedical research. Recent explainability methodologies have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value methods. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results by relationships that may exist between predictive features.\n\nWe implemented GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture utilizing prior knowledge. The prior knowledge is taken from a knowledge graph with weighted edges used to then generate initial importances for the nodes of the GNN input graph. The main novel component of GraphPINE is an importance propagation (IP) layer that propagates node importance through the GNN with gating similar to Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). In contrast to attention mechanisms in Graph Attention Networks, this places importance on nodes rather than edges. GraphPINE, therefore, provides understanding of both nodes and their relationships (given the GNN input graph). \n\nWe apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using pharmacogenomics data (i.e., both drug screening and gene data collected by several assays) for ~5K gene nodes included in a gene-gene input graph. The gene-gene graph and drug-gene target annotations were taken from literature curated prior knowledge sources and weighted by the literature information. GraphPINE demonstrates competitive performance and achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. To highlight the interpretability aspect of our work, we provide the ability to generate sub-graph visualizations with node importances. While our use case is related to biology, our work is generally applicable to tasks where information is separately known about feature relationships.

The claim of novelty in this paper is undermined by the existence of other interpretable GNN-based methods for drug response prediction.\n\n2. The ablation study is missing, and important baseline models are not included in the comparisons. The results show only marginal improvements over baseline models. For instance, ROC-AUC results show GraphPINE at 0.7955 compared to LightGBM at 0.7901, and PR-AUC results indicate 0.8939 vs 0.8917. These limited improvements weaken the overall impact of the claims.\n\n3. The authors should provide comprehensive comparative analyses with and without drug-target interaction (DTI) information to demonstrate the importance of DTI. If predictive performance is comparable to models that exclude DTI, this raises questions about the effective utilization of the interaction information."

The authors say these scores are obtained using the weights of the edges of a knowledge graph. How is this done? My doubt is that if we start from consolidated importance scores, the result's final propagated importance will present a bias since it will be strongly dependent on the initial weights.\n\n2) It is not clear to me if the authors compared their results against GAT, GT, and GINE. They present three GraphPINE versions based on those architectures, but a direct comparison with them is not provided. I am puzzled since, in the Appendix, they describe the hyperparameter tuning for those models, but no result from them is present in Table 1.\n\n3) The improvement brought by GraphPINE in terms of evaluation metrics is marginal with respect to other methods. In particular, it would be interesting to see how GAT, GT, and GINE perform when used as standalone techniques."

This should be carefully described in the main paper and not in the Appendix.\n\n2) If one used the initial importance scores to build a ranking of important nodes, would the outcome be different? If yes, then the methodology is effective; if no, probably the resutls are strongly affected by the initial importance scores.\n\n3) Can the authors show how GAT, GT, and GINE perform when used as standalone strategies?"
