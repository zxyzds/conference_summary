    "title": "Organizing Unstructured Image Collections using Natural Language",
    "abstract": "Organizing unstructured visual data into semantic clusters is a key challenge in computer vision. Traditional deep clustering (DC) approaches focus on a single partition of data, while multiple clustering (MC) methods address this limitation by uncovering distinct clustering solutions. The rise of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has enhanced MC by allowing users to define clustering criteria in natural language. However, manually specifying criteria for large datasets is impractical. In this work, we introduce the task Semantic Multiple Clustering (SMC) that aims to automatically discover clustering criteria from large image collections, uncovering interpretable substructures without requiring human input. Our framework, Text Driven Semantic Multiple Clustering (TeDeSC), uses text as a proxy to concurrently reason over large image collections, discover partitioning criteria, expressed in natural language, and reveal semantic substructures. To evaluate TeDeSC, we introduce the COCO-4c and Food-4c benchmarks, each containing four grouping criteria and ground-truth annotations. We apply TeDeSC to various applications, such as discovering biases and analyzing social media image popularity, demonstrating its utility as a tool for automatically organizing image collections and revealing novel insights.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a LLM-based method (the \"TeDeSC\" method) to address a proposed variant of the \"semantic multiple clustering\" problem, where both the clustering criteria and the groupings within each criterion are not known a priori and have to be generated with respect to the given data set.  \n\nGiven a set of images, the proposed TeDeSC (Text Driven Semantic Multiple Clustering) method leverages the ability of LLMs and MLLMs to generate the clustering criteria for the images and the groupings in each criterion.  For generating the clustering criteria, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) are used first to generate a caption for each image, and then the generated captions are fed to LLMs to generate a set of criteria that are relevant to the given images.  For generating the groupings within a criterion C, each image is first fed to a MLLM to generate a caption, conditioned on the criterion C; then, the captions of all of the images will go through a three-step process using LLMs to assign to each image a triplet of group labels, at three levels of semantic granularity.\n\nAlong the development of the proposed method, previously existent benchmark data sets are expanded with richer ground-truth clustering criteria and groupings.  The expanded ground-truth clustering criteria and groupings provide better coverage over the many valid grouping options in collections of images with high scene complexity."

Those applications illustrate how an approach for \"semantic multiple clustering\" (such as the proposed \"TeDeSC\" method) can be used in discovering spurious correlations and human bias in data, and in data understanding.  However, I feel that the paper should focus more on describing the details of the TeDeSC method, rather than using two pages to describe the three applications.\n\n(S3) The new benchmark data sets produced in this work may be interesting for future work."

How does a \"criterion token\" in the set R match with a \"criterion token\" in the ground-truth set Y?  Do the criteria tokens in the set R and the set Y come from a small superset of common tokens?  \n\n(Q4) In Section 4, \"Evaluation metrics for substructure uncovering\": Can we formulate the evaluation method of \"Semantic Consistency\" in a math formula?

It could be strengthened by incorporating more theoretical analysis on the integration of its components. For example, a discussion on why using LLMs can improve image clustering, compared to previous studies, would provide valuable insights.\n\n4. Biases in benchmark datasets have garnered considerable attention in recent years. For instance, [1] investigated geographic biases within the COCO dataset (used as a benchmark in this paper), and [2] explored spurious correlations between attributes like \"Blond\" and \"Female\" in the CelebA dataset. In response, developers of LLM products such as GPT and DALL-E have curated their training datasets and models to mitigate such spurious correlations. While the proposed method benefits from these mitigated biases by incorporating pre-trained LLMs into its pipeline, its contribution may be less impactful than suggested in Section 5, especially when compared to baseline methods trained from scratch on biased datasets.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02659\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10075"
