    "title": "Selective induction Heads: How Transformers Select Causal Structures in Context",
    "abstract": "Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal structures.Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context.  To this end, our framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains  with different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a 3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their functioning and interpretability.",

                "value": "* The synthetic task of modeling interleaved Markov Chains is interesting and definitely a step in the right direction. But do you think it is yet a good enough proxy to model the complex dynamics of token interactions? In language modeling, often these interactions are informed by the semantics of the tokens and the context. Whereas I don't think here the token meanings are important in any way.\n    \n* In my opinion, one of the things that made the induction head work interesting is that they found heads behaving in similar ways in actual large language models which were trained on real textual data. I am not really sure if the same can be said about the selective induction head circuit you found here. If this is something that can only be observed in a synthetic task, do we really care about it? Or, do you have any hypotheses about how selective induction heads might manifest in models trained on natural language texts? And, how do you plan to investigate this hypothesis (maybe in future work)?\n\n* In Section 5 you mentioned that a model when trained with less than k attention heads per layer was also able to successfully solve this task. This either suggests a completely different algorithm or is indicative of head-level superposition of information. Can you get more insights into this by looking at the attention maps?\n    * Also, have you tried with more than K heads per layer? I wonder if it would further break the mechanism. Or, you might start seeing duplicate heads behaving in similar ways.\n    * A similar question about the number of layers --- You need at least 2 layers to form the usual induction head behavior. Do you really need at least 3 layers for \"selective\" induction heads? Also, what happens with more layers? Do more layers introduce more \"steps\"? Or, some of the layers essentially become identity functions?"

                "value": "This paper presents an in context learning task that requires a model to infer what type of markov chain was used to generate the input tokens in order to predict the next token. Then it constructs a solution to this task with a three layer transformer that involves a particular type of attention head they call selective induction heads. In the final two pages an experiment is reported on where a three layer model is trained on this task and then the attention head patterns are visualized. The attention pattern in the constructed model and the trained model is highly similar, suggesting that the very same solution is achieved in both cases. \n\nThe paper is well written, and great care is taken in the presentation of the technical details to the theoretical solution. However, the task here is pretty idiosyncratic and a specialized transformer architecture is used to make the analysis easier to perform. The connection to actual in-context learning scenarios seems like it might be a bit fraught, I\u2019m not sure how much closer a lagging markov chain is to natural language than a normal markov chain. I also get the feeling that moving to a standard transformer architecture would make things a lot less pretty...\n\nGenerally, I am amenable to technical papers that deal with toy settings, so I think the core content of this paper is solid. However, I don\u2019t think that the title and framing of the paper is accurate. The process of selecting causal structures in context is incredibly general and complex, and selective induction heads are just a step in the direction of understanding how in context learning occurs. I think the title and framing needs more transparently communicate that this work is largely theoretical. How you do this is totally up to you and I\u2019m willing to raise my score if you address this concern.\n\nThe attention pattern visualization is remarkably similar between the constructed model and the trained model, so while this analysis is correlational, I would expect the causal claims to follow as well. That being said, you might wonder whether a standard transformer model trained on this task implements basically the same solution (I assume that the attention head pattern is different, otherwise you would have included results). I think the right way to understand this involves causality, and all the work that you reference comes from an AI safety mechanistic interpretability background, but there has been loads of work done in causal analysis of neural networks.

A 3-layer disentangled Transformer model is constructed to achieve this, with specifically designed purposes for each layer towards identifying the correct lag: capturing the transition probabilities, aggregating the probabilities, and summing the probabilities to select the lag. Empirical validation on synthetic data shows that the constructed transformer can achieve performance close to the theoretical maximum likelihood estimator across settings (contiguous, non-contiguous, many lags, single head), and the attention maps verify that the layers are performing the functions they were designed for."

Many natural language reasoning tasks have a non-linear and more complex causal structure, and it would be good to see how / whether this method extends to such tasks, beyond synthetic ones. \n* While Proposition 1 is defended by construction (and the empirical findings), it is unclear how Claim 1 is supported empirically (although it is acknowledged that this claim has yet to be formally proven) through the results in Section 5."

So in this context, Transformers have to not only learn the transition probabilities and Markov chain dependencies, but also have to learn to select the right Markov chain for prediction at t ignoring other interleaved ones that are not relevant for prediction at t. \n\nThe paper makes a theoretical construction based on Disentangled Transformers to show how Transformers, in principle, can utilize in-context examples to solve the task.
