    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel combined model named DiT-LSTM-SVAR, which successfully integrates time series and the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. This is the first to combine the microstructure of financial markets with deep learning networks to improve the performance of portfolios. We employ the DiT model to predict the upside and downside movements and an information decomposition model based on the SVAR model to identify random walk stocks. The DiT module significantly improves the Matthews correlation coefficient by almost 3\\%. The annual return of the portfolio is improved by almost 20\\%. The SVAR module greatly improves the Matthews correlation coefficient by almost 4\\%. Portfolios constructed using the DiT-LSTM-SVAR module based on market and public information outperformed those created with the DiT-LSTM model. The annual cumulative return of the portfolio is 266.60\\% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.8.",

                "value": "The paper investigated the portfolio problem in the Chinese market. The dataset was collected from 2022-01-04 to 2024-04-30. It contains 300 stocks in this market and 16 fundamental and technical features. \nThe authors decided to use LSTM and GRU networks to construct appropriate models for portfolio optimization. Four different baseline techniques, including GRU, LSTM, DiT-LSTM, and DiT-LSTM-SVAR, are used in the experiments. \nThe authors considered seven different metrics to measure the performance of various approaches as follows: \n(1) Cumulative Return\n(2) Annual Return\n(3) MDD\n(4) Annualized STD\n(5) Sharpe Ratio\n(6) Sortino\n(7) VaR95\nFinally, the authors concluded that the DiT-LSTM-SVAR model was the best model for this dataset in the Chinese market. \n\nIn principle, portfolio optimization and its variants are interesting problems in stock markets in different countries (Singapore, USA, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, etc.). All selected evaluation metrics are popular in this problem, and using LSTM or GRU or their variants for the portfolio problem was proven many years ago.

It would also be interesting if the paper did other experiments in different stock markets. \nRegarding the time period of data collection, I recognized that the dataset was only collected after the COVID-19 period. It would also be interesting if the authors could consider other periods to check the stability of the proposed techniques.\nBesides, the performance of short-term (for several weeks) and long-term (from several months to one year ) investments needs to be analyzed."

Since this work has employed DiT, why not consider using Transformer-based time predictors as well? Transformer-based time predictors such as Autoformer, iTransformer, PatchTST have already demonstrated high predictive accuracy across various domains.\n\n- While the model's performance is strong, there is a need for greater transparency in how the DiT-LSTM-SVAR model makes its predictions. Using forecasting paradigms proposed in models like N-BEATS and N-HITS, rather than using LSTMs which lack interpretability, can better help understand what patterns the DiT-LSTM-SVAR learns from the data."

None of the state-of-the-art methods are compared on the same experiment settings. Moreover, a key series of related literature papers are not cited in the paper, and the methods of those paper are not included for comparisons.

One one set of stocks from the Chinese market have been used to evaluate the performance. The authors are suggested to include more datasets from different stock markets, such as U.S. market, Hong Kong market, Japanese market, and so on.\n\n3.
