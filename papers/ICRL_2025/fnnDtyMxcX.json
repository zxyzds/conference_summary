    "title": "HeNCler: Node Clustering in Heterophilous Graphs via Learned Asymmetric Similarity",
    "abstract": "Clustering nodes in heterophilous graphs is challenging as traditional methods assume that effective clustering is characterized by high intra-cluster and low inter-cluster connectivity. To address this, we introduce HeNCler\u2014a novel approach for **He**terophilous **N**ode **Cl**ust**er**ing. \nHeNCler  *learns* a similarity graph by optimizing a clustering-specific objective based on weighted kernel singular value decomposition.\nOur approach enables spectral clustering on an *asymmetric* similarity graph, providing flexibility for both directed and undirected graphs. By solving the primal problem directly, our method overcomes the computational difficulties of traditional adjacency partitioning-based approaches. Experimental results show that HeNCler significantly improves node clustering performance in heterophilous graph settings, highlighting the advantage of its asymmetric graph-learning framework.",

                "value": "1. The innovation seems limited, as graph rewiring is already a common approach to tackle heterophilous graphs, as seen in [1] and [2]. However, it would be beneficial for the authors to clarify how their kernel spectral biclustering approach meaningfully differs from existing graph rewiring techniques. Specifically, a comparison of how these methods address heterophily and clustering effectiveness would strengthen the argument for the novelty of their approach. By expanding on the specific advantages or unique contributions of kernel spectral biclustering over rewiring methods, the authors could better situate their work within the current landscape.\n\n2. While the proposed method achieves the best performance in 11 out of 16 cases, the choice of only five baselines may limit the comprehensiveness of this evaluation. I suggest including additional baselines that are well-regarded in heterophilous graph clustering to provide a more robust comparison, like [4][5]. Additionally, reporting on the statistical significance of the observed improvements would help clarify whether these performance gains are practically meaningful or consistent across datasets.\n\n3. More detailed analysis of Table 4 would improve the discussion of the results. Specifically, it would be helpful for the authors to discuss the relative impact of the different components (e.g., the kernel spectral biclustering loss vs. reconstruction losses) in achieving the overall performance. Additionally, an investigation into any observed trends or dependencies among these components would provide insights into the roles they play in model performance.\n\n4. I recommend adding larger datasets, such as Ogbn-arxiv [3], to further validate the proposed method. Testing on larger datasets could help assess the scalability and robustness of the approach and reveal any computational challenges that might arise when handling high-dimensional data. This addition could provide a more comprehensive evaluation and help demonstrate the method's potential for broader applications.\n\n[1] Jiang, W., Gao, X., Xu, G., Chen, T., & Yin, H. (2024, May).

Analysis about the experimental results are somehow insufficient. The experimental results on undirected graphs seems not as good as directed graphs, such as Chamelon, squirrel. The authors should analyze this. In addition, the NMI in these datasets are very low (such as 9.67, 0.06, 6.73), which phenomenon indicates that the model even does not learn any clustering information. How to explain this?"

To my understanding, the most important part of wKSVD is its asymmetric similarity measure, which applies different projections to the pairs. However, it is a pretty trivial operation and this paper does not provide a in-depth explanation of how it helps in the context of heterophilous graphs.\n2. While the paper claims significant performance improvements, it does not compare with strong baselines or state-of-the-art methods for heterophilous graphs. There are various unsupervised heterophilous graph representation learning methods that could serve as competitive baselines, but the only competitor designed for heterophilous graphs is MUSE.\n3. I don't agree with the claimed computational complexity improvement of HeNCler. According to _Optimizer, constraints, and cluster assignment_, cluster assignments are obtained by KMeans clustering on the final embeddings, so you need to include the complexity of KMenas in the overall complexity analysis.\n4. The wKSVD-loss is based on the primal formulation of wKSVD, so it's unclear how most of Section 3.1 relates to the proposed method."
