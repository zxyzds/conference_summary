    "title": "ReNovo: Retrieval-Based \\emph{De Novo} Mass Spectrometry Peptide Sequencing",
    "abstract": "Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins. Tandem mass spectrometry, as the only high-throughput technique for protein sequence identification, plays a pivotal role in proteomics research. One of the long-standing challenges in this field is peptide identification, which entails determining the specific peptide (sequence of amino acids) that corresponds to each observed mass spectrum. The conventional approach involves database searching, wherein the observed mass spectrum is scored against a pre-constructed peptide database. However, the reliance on pre-existing databases limits applicability in scenarios where the peptide is absent from existing databases. Such circumstances necessitate \\emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, which derives peptide sequence solely from input mass spectrum, independent of any peptide database. Despite ongoing advancements in \\emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, its performance still has considerable room for improvement, which limits its application in large-scale experiments. In this study, we introduce a novel Retrieval-based \\emph{De Novo} peptide sequencing methodology, termed ReNovo, which draws inspiration from database search methods. Specifically, by constructing a datastore from training data, ReNovo can retrieve information from the datastore during the inference stage to conduct retrieval-based inference, thereby achieving improved performance. This innovative approach enables ReNovo to effectively combine the strengths of both methods: utilizing the assistance of the datastore while also being capable of predicting novel peptides that are not present in pre-existing databases. A series of experiments have confirmed that ReNovo outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple widely-used datasets, incurring only minor storage and time consumption, representing a significant advancement in proteomics. Supplementary materials include the code.",

Is the proposed method novel compared to recent advances in natural language processing?\n- Lack of comparison with database search methods. Although overcoming the limitations of database search is a primary motivation, the proposed method is not compared against database search approaches. At least a simple search baseline against the same training database should be implemented for comparison. Ideally, state-of-the-art database search methods should aslo be compared against.\n- Potential data splitting issues. The leave-one-out data split by species, while seemingly reasonable, might lead to data leakage. Specifically, the same peptides could appear across different species (potentially even with identical or highly similar MS\u00b2 spectra). Please analyze the overlap of spectra and peptides between the training and test sets, for example, by assessing vector similarity between binned spectra and sequence identity to evaluate spectral and peptide similarity, respectively.\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n- Figure 1: Clarify what is meant by \u201cidentification rate\u201d\u2014is it the accuracy of preptide prediction?\n- Table 1: Confidence intervals or standard deviations for the reported values are missing.\n- Line 160: What is the charge state of the precursor ion?

After model training, the datastore stores outputs from the trained model across the entire training dataset, which are then used during test-time inference via k-NN indexing.

To address this, it would be relevant to see, for example, results from the following experiment: evaluate the ReNovo without Retrieval model of larger size (e.g., by increasing the transformer\u2019s number of layers and hidden dimensionality) and compare it to ReNovo, as illustrated, for instance, in Figure 3.\n\n- Another related concern is the train-test splitting strategy. The text states that \u201cpeptides appearing in the testing set are completely distinct from those in the training set.\u201d It would be valuable to assess the method\u2019s performance under a stricter splitting criterion, such as one based on a sequence similarity threshold rather than sequence identity. Such an experiment would demonstrate whether the improved performance is due to generalization rather than overfitting to the training dataset through the \u201cdatastore\u201d approach. This could be also tested by measuring the model\u2019s improvement on test sequences that lack similar sequences in the training set.\n\n- Certain essential parts of the text lack clarity.\n    - The term \u201ccontext features\u201d is central to the work but is not clearly defined.

                "value": "1. The paper primarily employs a token-level RAG method from NLP but does not thoroughly discuss its origins or previous related work. Specifically, there is no comprehensive section on RAG methods, with most background instead focused on de novo methods. The approach closely resembles the KNN-LM paper, which originally proposed storing context and next tokens in a datastore; however, this foundational work is not referenced. \n\nAdditionally, the paper omits discussion on recent advancements in de novo methods, such as GraphNovo, PepNet, PrimeNovo, and InstaNovo, all of which are documented in Bittremieux et al.'s survey on de novo peptide sequencing methods, if author needs to refer to a good source.\n\n2. Missing Performance Comparisons: The model performance comparisons in the main table do not adequately reflect recent advancements in the field, with several relevant methods from the past year omitted. Including a broader range of models would provide a clearer view of the current state of the art.\n\n3. Clarification is needed on the training and testing datasets: whether a single model was trained on a single dataset and used for all number reporting or if separate models were trained for each dataset? Additionally, it would be helpful to confirm if the reported performance numbers for baseliens are replications or directly quoted from original papers. For instance, discrepancies are noted between some results here and those reported for CasaNovo paper i read from their published journal. \n\n4. For the case study, a direct alignment between the predicted and retrieved spectra would make the comparison clearer. The current presentation lacks an easily interpretable visual comparison of their similarities.\n\n5. If the first stage of training essentially reproduces the Casanovo model, the authors could consider using available open-source models for this step. Testing stronger baseline models could indicate whether enhanced context representations lead to better context features in the datastore. No need to re-train casanovo as first stage IMO. \n\n6. Including a recall-coverage curve could offer valuable insights into performance across varying confidence levels, which is especially useful for biologists relying on model certainty for predictions on unlabeled data. This would provide more depth than single averaged metrics, which may not fully capture the model's reliability."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The authors use training data to construct the datastore, but I believe this approach could benefit from further discussion and refinement. In mainstream RAG-based methods, the datastore is generally maintained as an independent entity, distinct from the training data for language models. This separation allows the datastore to act as an \u201cadditional\u201d resource that complements a model\u2019s learned knowledge. When the same dataset is used for both training the language model and constructing the datastore, much of the useful information may already be encoded in the model weights through the training phase, reducing the unique value of \u201cretrieval.\u201d Specifically, the language model\u2019s objective\u2014next-token prediction\u2014already captures \u201ccontext-target\u201d relationships by predicting the next token based on the previous context. Token-level retrieval, in this context, could become redundant, as the model effectively performs this retrieval autonomously. I strongly recommend the authors separate training data from datastore data to better evaluate the impact of retrieval on de novo sequencing. It would also be useful to see how a larger datastore, too complex to incorporate into training, might act as an external resource that enhances model performance.\n\n\n\nDuring inference, could you clarify how the top K \u201cnext target\u201d retrievals assist the model? Formulas 9-10 lack clarity in this respect. Simplifying the formulas and using clearer explanations would improve comprehension, as sophisticated formulas are only effective if they are accompanied by a clear rationale. Specifically, does the probability for each amino acid derive directly from the retrieved targets in the output layer, or is it calculated after embedding these K tokens into the input layers?"

It may be beneficial to replicate a typical scenario, such as in a 7/9 species setup, where I could supply a complete database of closely related organisms. For instance, while humans and chickens diverged around 300 million years ago, it has been shown that error-tolerant approaches can effectively bridge that gap. Unless going for very obscure organisms, there are related species available and that should be the starting point.\n\n\u2022\tIn practical proteomics applications, reliability is crucial, yet the benchmark setup appears limited in this context. Most mass spectra tend to be low quality, and redundancy in measurements is high. Standard practice (and often a requirement for publications in the field) necessitates that peptide identifications exceed a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Currently, the authors only provide precision and recall metrics, which do not indicate how many peptides the search algorithm considers reliable. It is not essential for every spectrum to be identified. Can the authors also present the number of peptides identified above the 1% FDR threshold?"
