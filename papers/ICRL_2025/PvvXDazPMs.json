    "abstract": "Recent large visual-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict discretized or continuous actions by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. \nIn contrast, we model the continuous action with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head. \nBy leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. \nExtensive experiments demonstrate Diffusion Transformer Policy pre-trained on diverse robot data can generalize to different embodiments, including simulation environments like Maniskill2 and Calvin, as well as the real-world Franka arm. \nSpecifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Calvin novel task setting, and the pre-training stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2. The code will be publicly available.",

Different from previous diffusion policies, DiT policy directly utilizes a causal transformer to perform diffusion denoising conditioned via in-context multimodal tokens. Specifically, language instruction and image observations are tokenized by CLIP and DINOv2, respectively. Then, the image tokens are compressed with Q-Former, conditioned by the language tokens via FiLM. After that, language tokens, compressed image tokens, diffusion timestep and the noisy actions are passed to a causal transformer for action denoising. Experiments in simulation environments (ManiSkill2, CALVIN) and real-world robot platform (Franka robot) demonstrate the performance of the proposed policy."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Real-World Experiments**.\n    - **Task Setting**. The task settings are too easy with only \u201cpicking\u201d operations. Despite that the authors claim that it is a challenging setup with small object (L370-371), I believe that only picking small objects would not be so difficult. I would suggest adding real-world manipulation experiments besides picking (and pick-and-place), *e.g.*, open drawer/door, pouring (with rotation actions), and long-horizon tasks, etc.\n    - **Few-Shot Setting**. Collecting 50 trajectories for each task in the first three tasks (L368-369) results in totally 150 demonstrations, which is not a few-shot settings. Previous works [1, 2] has proved that 50 demonstrations in the real world are sufficient for the policy to learn complex behaviors far beyond picking, even w/o pre-training. Generally, using less than 10 demonstrations can be considered as \u201cfew-shot\u201d [3, 4] for robot learning.\n    - **Few-Shot Baselines**. While the authors employ Octo [5] and OpenVLA [6] as zero-shot generalization baselines, it would be consistent and convincing to have both methods also as few-shot generalization baselines.\n    - **Few-Shot Results**. The current \u201cfew-shot fine-tuning\u201d results in Table 4 seems a little low for the simple picking operations. Please provide additional object informations (Question 4 & 5) for task difficulty evaluations. The videos in the supplementary results lack unseen object evaluations (task-4 and task-5) and baseline performance.\n    \n2. **Improper Baseline Choices in CALVIN Experiment**. Developing an expressive generalist policy with a better generalization performance seems to be the key motivation of the paper. The generalization ability of the DiT policy is heavily boosted by large-scale OXE [7] pre-training (in CALVIN experiment, the policy outperform its w/o pre-training variant by 1.2 in success sequence length, L022-023), which is reasonable since large-scale pre-training exposes the policy to more robot data. Therefore, the baselines in CALVIN experiment should also access to a similar amount of robot data. Specifically,\n    - **(a)** If the authors want to emphasize on the generalization ability of the DiT policy itself (not boosted by the large-scale pre-training), they should compare the DiT policy w/o pre-training  with some of the following policies: 3D diffusor actors [8], MDT [9], MT-ACT [10], Multitask-DP [11], etc., all trained with similar amount of data.\n    - **(b)** If the authors want to emphasize that the DiT policy is suitable for large-scale pre-training and able to gain better generalization performance after large-scale pre-training, they should compare the DiT policy w/ pre-training with some of the following policies: RT-1/2-X [7], Octo [5], OpenVLA [6], MT-ACT [10] w/ OXE pre-training, Multitask-DP [11] w/ OXE pre-training, all fine-tuning with the same amount of data.\n    \n    Also, it is worth noticing that MDT [9] performs well in CALVIN benchmark even w/o large-scale robot data pre-training, though it has not been evaluated under the ABC\u2192D settings in its paper. Evaluating MDT under this setting can serve as a strong baseline in CALVIN benchmark, even for situation (b). For most image-based policies [5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11], the observation modalities can be easily aligned with the DiT policy (single-view RGB images) for fairness considerations.\n    \n3. **Writings**.

Especially for one-step prediction, since it has been proved that action chunking [8] (i.e., multi-step action prediction) is an effective technique for robotic manipulation policies [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and the trajectory length ablation (L418-420) also supports the argument.\n4.

If the evaluation scenarios include additional skills, it would be better.\n\nIt lacks the parameter scaling experiments of the Causal Transformer part. For example, the impact of different amounts of parameters and pre-training data on the results.\n\nWhy is it necessary to perform action decoding in a causal transformer with shared parameters? What if we simply use a larger DiT to replace the diffusion action head on the basis of Octo (such as [1] ) ? One advantage of doing so is that there is no need to pad the action vector. This paper lacks these experiments. I want to know which of these two design paradigms is better.\n\nFrom the perspective of contribution to the community, this paper does not propose a powerful foundation model; at least the real-world experiments do not support this claim.
