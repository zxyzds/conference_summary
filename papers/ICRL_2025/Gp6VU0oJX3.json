    "title": "A Causal Theoretical Framework for Open Set Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) faces two critical challenges: the emergence\nof unknown classes in the target domain and changes in observed distributions\nacross domains. Although numerous studies have proposed advanced algorithms,\nrecent experimental results demonstrate that the classical Empirical Risk Mini\u0002mization (ERM) approach still delivers state-of-the-art performance. However,\nfew theories can effectively explain this disputed phenomenon. To address the\ntheoretical gap, we focus on constructing a causal theoretical framework for OSDA.\nWe formulate the novel concepts of the Fully Informative Causal Invariance Model\n(FICIM) and the Partially Informative Causal Invariance Model (PICIM). Subse\u0002quently, We derive an OSDA theoretical bound to prove that the ERM performs\nwell when the source domain follows FICIM, while it performs poorly when the\nsource domain follows PICIM. The different results may be attributed to the vary\u0002ing amounts of available information when bounding the target domain\u2019s stable\nexpected risk. Finally, across different datasets, we conduct extensive experiments\non the FICIM and PICIM source domains to validate the effectiveness of our\ntheoretical results.",

                "value": "This paper proposes two classes of causal models (FICIM and PICIM) for the data generating process in order to understand distribution shift in Open Set Domain Adaptation. Based on these causal models, they derive bounds on the risk on the target set given the risk on the source set using ERM. They theoretically demonstrate that the target risk for FICIM is bounded, however for PICIM it may be unbounded. Empirical experiments verify these claims."

The authors claim that ERM performs well when trained on a source domain of the FICIM type, as the expected risk $R_T$ in the target domain is bounded by the expected risk $R_S(Y|X^C)$ in the source domain (Theorem 3). In contrast, ERM performs poorly on datasets of the PICIM type (Theorem 5). Furthermore, the authors validate their theoretical findings on CMNIST, synthetic datasets, and restaurant review (text) data."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I believe one of the important contributions of the paper is the introduction of the PICIM and FICIM concepts. This classification approach is already a common consensus in the field of invariant learning. However, the paper\u2019s presentation is rather disorganized, and the clarity of expression is insufficient, making it difficult to read. Additionally, I feel that the authors have not developed a meaningful method for adapting OSDA based on their theoretical framework, making the contribution somewhat lacking. Any effort to introduce new ideas is certainly welcome, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend accepting this paper.\n\n**Issues with PICIM and FICIM**:\n\n- The concepts of PICIM and FICIM proposed in this paper seem to originate from the FIIF and PIIF models introduced by [Ahuja et al., 2021], which also focus on modeling the data generation process. This concept has been widely cited in the invariant learning literature, such as in [Liu et al., 2021] and [Chen et al., 2022]. What is the variable $Z$ in Figure 2? I searched the entire paper but could not find a definition for $Z$. Moreover, the bidirectional arrows between $Y$ and $V$ are not clearly defined, and the types of arrows are explicitly described in Section 2.6 of [Causality, 2009]. I suggest that the authors add the environment variable $E$ to the causal graph to represent changes in causal relationships across different domains.\n- I am confused about Theorem 3. In the causal graph of FICIM, there still exists an association between $C$ and $V$. How does the ERM algorithm ensure that invariant features and spurious features can be successfully disentangled? In other words, we can only obtain the expected risk $R_S(Y|X)$, and ERM cannot achieve the stable expected risk $R_S(Y|X^C)$. This seems to contradict the results of [Ahuja et al., 2021] (Theorems 3 and 4).\n\n[Ahuja et al., 2021]. \"Invariance principle meets information bottleneck for out-of-distribution generalization.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* 34 (2021): 3438-3450.\n\n[Liu et al., 2021]. \"Learning causal semantic representation for out-of-distribution prediction.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* 34 (2021): 6155-6170.\n\n[Chen et al., 2022]. \"Learning causally invariant representations for out-of-distribution generalization on graphs.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* 35 (2022): 22131-22148.\n\nPearl, Judea. *Causality*. Cambridge university press, 2009.\n\n**Unclear Notation**:\n\n- The notation system in the paper is extremely confusing, and using $P_X$ and $P_{X|Y}$ seems meaningless. For instance, in line 218,  $p_{Y|X^C}^{d_i}(y|x) = p^{d_j}_{Y|X^C}(y|x)$---are you trying to express that the domain of $x$ remains invariant as element $X^C$? Wouldn\u2019t it be clearer to denote cross-domain invariance as $P^{d_i}(Y|X = X^C) = P^{d_j}(Y|X = X^C)$?\n- Definitions 5-6 appear to be redundant, reiterating well-known concepts in the field, seemingly to pad the length of the paper.\n- In lines 282-283, the subscript $C \\in \\mathcal{C}_S$ of $\\sup$ is not displayed correctly as a subscript. Additionally, $p^TC(c)$ and $p^SC(c)$ are miswritten, and the same symbol error appears in line 300 with $p^TC(c)$.\n\n**Other Issues**:\n\n- I don\u2019t quite understand how the \"Risk of unknown target classes\" in Theorem 3 is calculated. Under FIIF, ERM cannot disentangle $C$ and $V$, so how can you ensure that $Z^*_S$ originates from $X^C$?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In Proposition 1, regarding the definition of domain invariance, is $X$ truly domain-invariant given $C$? Referring to the causal graph in [Chen et al., 2022], introducing the domain variable $D$, which points to $V$, would imply that given $C$, the chain structure $X \\leftarrow V \\leftarrow D$ indicates that $X$ is related to $D$, i.e., $P^{d_i}(X|C) \\neq P^{d_j}(X|C)$.\n- In Definition 6, the expected risk is defined, but in line 217, the function $f$ is said to map to the invariant element $X^C$, whereas in the loss function $\\ell(f(x),y)$, $f$ seems to map to the label. Are both of these functions denoted by the same symbol $f$?"

In Assumption 1, invariant attributes are required to satisfy that both $P(Y|C)$ and $P(X|C)$ are invariant across domains. Notice that, $X$ is the input data, e.g., an image. I never see this assumption in any related work before, and such an assumption is also unrealistic. Let $X$ be the image of dogs sitting on different backgrounds  in different domains, and the primary object of interest is the dog. In this case, the semantic feature of dog could be the invariant feature, but the distribution of the images changes across the domains as the background changes.  Also, in the two frameworks in Figure 2, both $C$ and $V$ are parents of $X$, so $P(X|C)$ in general should not be the same, as it also depends on $V$. \n\n\n\nI was thinking if it was only a typo. However, while I just went over the rest of the paper, it seems that $P(X|C)$ being invariant is used multiple times in the theoretic derivations.\n\nI may have a misunderstanding about this assumption.  If authors can provide examples or scenarios where this assumption hold in practice, I would like to re-evaluate the paper during rebuttal period."
