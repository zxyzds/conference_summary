    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series Generation (MTSG) plays a crucial role in time series analysis, supporting tasks such as data augmentation and anomaly detection. While several methods exist for MTSG, recommending the most suitable method for new scenarios remains a significant challenge. Although prior work by  (Ang et al., 2023a) provides guidance for selecting MTSG methods, it lacks coverage of recent diffusion-based methods and has limited exploration of channel-independent frameworks. We address these gaps by improving the recommendation guide, highlighting the effectiveness of a central discriminator within the channel-independent framework. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for time series classification in small-sample scenarios. Our revised guide makes three key recommendations: 1) VAE-based methods excel on small-scale datasets; 2) a channel-independent framework with the newly designed central discriminator is optimal in most cases; and 3) a diffusion-based method is preferable when ample data and computational resources are available.",

Through comprehensive analysis, the authors identified limitations in existing frameworks, specifically the limited exploration of channel-independent frameworks and a lack of evaluation for diffusion-based models. By enhancing the central discriminator within the channel-independent framework, incorporating methods such as TimesNet and attention mechanisms, and introducing CCD, the study demonstrates notable performance improvements in small-sample scenarios."

                "value": "- **Motivation:** The motivation for this work is not fully justified. The rationale for addressing limitations in channel-independent methods and diffusion models in MTSG for small-sample datasets seems somewhat forced. Small-sample datasets tend to yield low-quality results in diffusion models due to limited information, challenging the model\u2019s ability to learn data distributions. Despite this, the paper shows that CCDGAN\u2019s performance is comparable to that of Diffusion-TS, suggesting a lack of theoretical and empirical support for this motivation.\n- **Dataset Limitation:** Although the paper claims TSGGuide is a highly flexible mechanism capable of adapting to diverse tasks, it only evaluates stock, energy, and medical datasets. The limited selection constrains the demonstration of the module\u2019s plug-and-play capability, which may impact the credibility of its claimed flexibility across various domains.\n- **Channel-Independent Approach:** The paper\u2019s choice to adopt a channel-independent framework raises questions when applied to stock datasets, which exhibit strong inter-channel correlations (e.g., stocks in the same sector often follow similar trends). While the model demonstrates effectiveness, it may overlook inherent characteristics of financial data by disregarding these correlations."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Given that only stock, energy, and medical datasets were used, how might this affect the generalizability and credibility of TSGGuide\u2019s flexibility across different domains?\n\n- In small-sample contexts, GANs generally outperform diffusion-based models. Yet, as noted in the paper, CCDGAN does not significantly outperform Diffusion-TS. Can the authors provide additional evidence to substantiate their theoretical claims?\n\n- Is CCDGAN essentially a combination of the CCD mechanism with GAN? The methodology section lacks detail here; could you provide more on how CCDGAN was developed?\n\n- Given the emphasis on a channel-independent framework, why are there no comparisons with channel-mixed framework methods? Since channel-independent frameworks ignore inter-sequence interactions, empirical evidence is needed to validate their benefits, especially for financial datasets where sequences are highly correlated."

                "value": "W1. The technical contribution need to be clarified. The proposed method reshapes time series data and applies a 2D convolutional framework, followed by optimization with a basic GAN architecture. However, this approach lacks novelty and may fall short in capturing the complex inter-channel correlations inherent to multivariate time series. Reshaping the data and applying 2D convolutions does not seem to address the unique and complicated dependencies between channels. A more comprehensive module that learns correlations directly to capture correlations and periodicity might be more effective and adaptive. Moreover, The CCD relies on 2D convolutions, a standard technique in time series modeling (such as TCN). The paper does not sufficiently justify what specific innovation CCD brings beyond typical 2D convolutional methods.\n\nW2. The experiments focus on stock, energy, and EEG datasets, which may not sufficiently represent the diversity of real-world MTSG applications. The results would be more convincing if the proposed approach were evaluated on datasets covering additional scenarios of spatial-temporal forecasting (such as OD flow and traffic forecasting), which would better validate the method\u2019s generalizability and effectiveness.\n\nW3. The baselines used for comparison are not up-to-date, with the latest being from 2023. More recent methods like TimeGAE [1] and DLT [2] should be included to conduct sufficient experiment. What\u2019s more, the paper lacks a detailed hyperparameter experiments, such as the weighting factor gamma in Equation 6. \n\nW4.

Some baselines are also missing.\n\n2. The writing is so confusing. I seldom comment a paper with this issue. But this paper's contribution is quite unclear. I spent several days trying to understand the central contribution of this paper. In abstract, the authors said that they would like to provide a recommendation. I understand it as a kind of more instructive benchmark. But then they start to present CCD, which is a margnially novel improvement on the GAN-based model (a new kind of discriminator in GAN). After that they again start to do analysis. My understanding is that the authors propose a relatively new improvement on GAN-based models. But then they found that the proposed model is still defeated by VAE-based model on small-scale dataset and diffusion models when resource is sufficient. So they try to sell their work by embedding it into a so-called recommendation.\n\n3. Some results in this recommendation is well-known. The finding 4 about diffusion model's large training and inference load is well-known."
