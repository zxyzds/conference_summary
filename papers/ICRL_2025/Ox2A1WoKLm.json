    "title": "Towards Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models: Unlearning Identity, Nudity and Artistic Styles",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across various domains. However, the increasing demand for content moderation and the removal of specific concepts from these models has introduced the challenge of \\textit{unlearning}. In this work, we present a suite of robust methodologies that significantly enhance the unlearning process by employing advanced loss functions within knowledge distillation frameworks. Specifically, we utilize the Cramer-Wold distance and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence to facilitate more efficient and versatile concept removal. Although current non-learning techniques are effective in certain scenarios, they are typically limited to specific categories such as identity, nudity, or artistic style. In contrast, our proposed methods demonstrate robust versatility, seamlessly adapting to and performing effectively across a wide range of concept erasure categories. Our approach outperforms existing techniques, achieving consistent results across different unlearning categories and showcasing its broad applicability. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method not only surpasses previous benchmarks but also addresses key limitations of current unlearning techniques, paving the way for more responsible use of text-to-image diffusion models.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) The authors argue that the commonly used L2 loss function is suboptimal for unlearning, leading them to propose the use of Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence and Cram\u00e9r-Wold (CW) distance. However, the justification for using these specific loss functions could be more rigorous. While the paper briefly explains why these alternatives might work better, it lacks an in-depth theoretical or empirical foundation demonstrating why these loss functions are inherently superior for the range of concept erasure scenarios tested.\n\n2) Although the paper claims that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques, the comparative analysis appears to be limited. The choice of baseline methods seems selective, focusing on techniques that primarily use L2 loss, while more diverse and recent alternatives in the literature may have been overlooked. Additionally, the experiments are conducted on the Stable Diffusion 1.4 model, and it is unclear how these results generalize to other diffusion models or versions. Testing on multiple models or providing a discussion on potential limitations across models would enhance the validity of the claimed generalizability.\n\n3) The use of a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework is central to the method, but there is limited discussion about the assumptions and limitations of this setup. For example, the model may experience \"catastrophic forgetting,\" where learning new concepts could unintentionally erase other important knowledge. Although the authors mention mitigation of catastrophic forgetting, the specifics of how they address it are vague, and empirical evidence on this aspect seems sparse."

                "value": "1) Why were JS divergence and Cram\u00e9r-Wold distance chosen over other distance measures?

How does the distillation process handle \"catastrophic forgetting\" or unintended interference with non-targeted knowledge?\n3) The paper mentions preserving retained concepts post-unlearning. However, does the model\u2019s creative diversity or ability to generalize decrease when multiple concepts are erased consecutively?"

If this approach could be applied more generally across other methods, it would make the paper\u2019s claims more convincing.\n\n- I would like to know about the details of the benchmarks used in the experiments. Additionally, I believe that more diverse concepts should be tested in the quantitative evaluation.

SDD is used as the base erasure technique in the paper, but is not explained in the related works or background. The authors could explain the method briefly for clarity.\n\n3. The method is well motivated - but the evaluations are not sufficient quantitatively. \na. table 1 presents that the JS is better at certain epochs of training and not so good in others. This is a confusing evaluation for comparison. Ideally - these methods can be trained for much longer and compared at the final epochs. I am curious why authors chose this\nb. Table 2 - the unlearning performance seems to be very similar across all the methods (which does not support the claim). Also the test set seems to be a single prompt which isn't an ideal setup. \nc. Table 3 is only tested on a single prompt which is not ideal sample set \nd. if the student model is not being trained - why is the output changing for both teacher and student in Figure 4? \n\n\n4. The motivation of the paper comes from 4 lemmas - these were not empirically tested in the paper"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The main precedence of L2 objective being \"unreliable\" is that even when concepts dimensions are erased, L2 is non-zero because of other dimensions. Is this under assumption that there are certain dimensions that represent concept and certain that do not? Is this a practical assumption? I could be misunderstanding the lemma 1 proof. I understand that the diffusion loss is being computed in the noise space (where certain pixels may belong to the concepts and certain pixels do not) - but isn't this being taken care by the ground truth in ESD or CA or any other prior work? \n\n2. In Section 3.2 - does Eq. 3 mean to optimize the student or the teacher? This is used interchangeable across the paper - The authors could clarify this. \n\n3. If the student model is not being trained - why is the output changing for both teacher and student in Figure 4? \n\n4. Why did the authors compare the methods at certain unlearning epoch steps? Why not completely unlearn and test against the final version? \n\n5. How does the performance look across a larger dataset?"
