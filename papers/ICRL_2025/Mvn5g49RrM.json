    "title": "RedCodeAgent:  Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Code Agents",
    "abstract": "LLM-based code agents, integrated with external tools like the Python interpreter, can interact with broad system environments and leverage code execution feedback to improve or self-debug generated code for better task-solving. However, as these code agents evolve rapidly in terms of capabilities, their increasing sophistication also amplifies security risks, such as generating or executing risky and buggy code. Traditional static safety benchmarks and manually designed red-teaming tools struggle to keep up with this rapid evolution, lacking the ability to adapt dynamically to the changing behaviors of code agents. To address these limitations, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent against given code agents. Equipped with red-teaming tools for function-calling and a novel memory module for accumulating successful attack experience, RedCodeAgent dynamically optimizes input prompts to jailbreak the target code agent for risky code execution. Unlike static benchmarks or red-teaming tools, RedCodeAgent autonomously adapts its attack strategies, making it a scalable solution to the growing challenge of testing increasingly sophisticated code agents. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art LLM jailbreaking methods, RedCodeAgent achieves significantly higher attack success rates on the same tasks while maintaining high overall efficiency. By autonomously exploring and exploiting vulnerabilities of code agents, RedCodeAgent provides critical insights into the evolving security risks of code agents.",

In this sense, RedCodeAgent may come across as a combination of established methods rather than a distinct innovation. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand what specifically differentiates RedCodeAgent for jailbreaking code agents as opposed to LLMs or general LLM agents, as the current design seems adaptable to other models without substantial modification.\n\n- The evaluation of RedCodeAgent might benefit from a broader comparison. \n\nFirst, while the paper employs certain jailbreak methods, there are more recent approaches [1] that reportedly achieve higher success rates, and it would be useful to know why these weren\u2019t included. Second, RedCodeAgent is presented as a combination of various jailbreak methods; therefore, it might be more meaningful to compare its performance against combinations of jailbreak methods, rather than individual ones. Lastly, considering tools specifically designed for LLM agents, like those referenced in [2], may offer a more comprehensive evaluation. \n\n[1] Yi, S., Liu, Y., Sun, Z., Cong, T., He, X., Song, J., Xu, K. and Li, Q., 2024.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Limited workload due to LLM automation**: LLM-based tools like RedCodeAgent are relatively easy to implement. Essentially, the methodology mainly involves crafting prompts to call existing LLMs and using simple Python scripts to automate the entire process. This raises questions about the extent of the authors' contribution, as much of the heavy lifting is performed by the LLM itself.\n2. **Limited novelty**: The design of RedCodeAgent appears to be quite standard and straightforward. It utilizes existing jailbreaking algorithms to bypass the defenses of the target code agent, allowing the code agent to execute the attacker's desired code. Then, its LLM-based code substitution tool is used to obfuscate the code while maintaining its functionality. This process is repeated until the attack is successful or abandoned. The memory + tool design is also standard for building agents with LLM. In my opinion, this approach seems to lack deep conceptual innovation or novel techniques that advance the state of the art.\n3. **Limited flexibility**: It seems that the implementation of RedCodeAgent is not generic, as its evaluation module used to determine whether an attack is successful appears to be closely tied to the RedCode-Exec dataset. As seen in `evaluation.py`, this module reads the dataset's JSON files and extracts the corresponding `expected_result` based on the attack type to determine whether the attack is successful. Therefore, if only a target code agent is provided without the dataset, or if the dataset's JSON format is changed, RedCodeAgent might not function properly.\n4. There are some concerns regarding the experiments:\n   - Firstly, among all baselines, the simplest, static method without any optimization (i.e., RedCode-Exec) almost achieved the best performance with over a 54% success rate. In other words, most optimization algorithms in the baselines (e.g., AmpleGCG, AutoDAN) resulted in negative optimization. This indicates that (1) the target code agent itself lacks robust defenses, and (2) the baseline algorithms with optimization are either too weak or not suitable for the tasks in the evaluation.\n   - Secondly, if I understand correctly, RedCodeAgent can be viewed as a combination of all baselines plus a code substitution tool, automated by an LLM with multiple attempts. Therefore, it is not surprising that it achieves the best performance, and its improvement may not be as impactful as suggested."

If the main motivation is the possibility of prompt injection, showing this red-teaming agent work in the context of prompt injections would help better illustrate the purpose of this dataset.\n* Why is the query time of the agent so high?
