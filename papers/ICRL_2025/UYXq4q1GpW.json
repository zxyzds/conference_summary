    "title": "A Healthy Food Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering and Transformers",
    "abstract": "Unhealthy eating habits are a major contributing factor to public health problems such as the globally rising obesity rate. One way to help solve this problem is by creating systems that can suggest better food choices in order to improve the way people eat. A critical challenge with these systems is making sure they offer 1) suggestions that match what users like, while also 2) recommending healthy foods. In this paper, we introduce a novel food recommender system that provides healthy food recommendations similar to what the user has previously eaten. We used collaborative filtering to generate recommendations and re-ranked the recommendations using a novel health score and a BERT embedding similarity score. We evaluated our system on human subjects by conducting A/B testing on several methods deployed in a web application.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the food recommendation issues by considering food nutrition beyond collaborative preferences. The collaborative preferences are captured by two Collaborative Filtering methods (SVD and EASE). At the same time, the food nutrition scores are computed via two authors-defined empirical equations (Healthy Contribution and Unhealthy Contribution). Experiments are conducted on a filtered COCO Nutrition Database with 11.5K foods. A human evaluation with 22 users is also conducted to compare the two SVD and EASE models."

                "value": "The paper presents a novel approach to recommend food products that could, at the same time, meet two constraints: 1) suggest accurate items according to which users like; 2) suggest healthy food. Unlike previous similar approaches, the authors propose to incorporate nutritional information within the recommendation pipeline, such as essential nutrients and possibly harmful components. Then, they also propose to adopt BERT to generate semantic embeddings to learn the relationships between different food items. Finally, the system allows to customize the user experience by letting the user decide which nutrients to take into account in the received recommendations. The overall approach consists of the following steps. First, the authors exploit two popular collaborative filtering algorithms, namely, EASE and SVD, to generate traditional food item recommendations. Second, to address health, the framework generates and injects vector embeddings (through BERT) that are used to cluster food products and find the top-k similar list of items to the ones previously recommended; this allows the user to receive alternatives. After that, the nutritional score is computed with the healthy and unhealthy nutrition contributions. Finally, the nutritional score and the similarity score (from the clustering) are combined to obtain a final recommendation score. Results of the offline evaluation showed that the SVD method could outperform EASE. In addition to this, the authors conducted online A/B testing with web applications, which showed that the EASE method was actually outperforming the SVD one."

The proposed solution combines the power of Collaborative Filtering (CF) with a semantic-based similarity score for the food recommended in the first stage (CF). This, combined with a final health score, should give users the possibility to explore new food alternatives that they enjoy but which are also healthy.\n\nThe solution is straightforward: SVD can be used in the first stage, followed by a BERT-based similarity score for ingredients and food nutrition in the second stage, alongside a novel health score.\n\nThe idea is interesting, and the authors also conducted an A/B test. The main issue here is the lack of comparisons with previous works, for instance (but not just limited to) Pecan (2020). I strongly suggest the authors consider ways to perform quantitative comparisons with experiments (not online experiments, offline with a dataset would be ok), ideally using the same datasets as prior studies where possible. While a qualitative assessment was included, a clear quantitative comparison is needed to understand the benefits of the proposed solution.\n\nAdditionally, further insights are needed: which recommendations were effective, which were not, and why? How can these be improved? An A/B test that only compares different CF methods does not sufficiently add value to the assessment of the work."

By using BERT for semantic embeddings, the authors leverage recent advancements in natural language processing to enhance the understanding of food relationships.

The systematic evaluation of nutritional scores adds a robust layer to the recommendation process, ensuring that suggestions are not only appealing but also health-oriented. \n\nThe paper is clearly organized, with each section building logically on the previous one. The visual representation in Figure 1 provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, making it easier for readers to grasp the flow and interaction of components. The explanations of each step in the recommendation process are thorough, enhancing the reader's understanding of how user preferences and nutritional data are integrated.\n\nThe significance of this work lies in its potential impact on promoting healthier eating habits through personalized recommendations. By addressing the dual goals of satisfying user preferences and supporting health-related dietary choices, the system aligns with current trends in nutrition and wellness."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the paper presents a food recommender system that integrates user preferences with nutritional data, it falls short in several key areas that limit its contribution to the field. The concepts largely rehash existing methods in food recommendation systems without introducing sufficiently novel insights. Although the authors attempt to integrate collaborative filtering and contextual embeddings, both EASE/SVD and BERT-based embeddings are well-established techniques. This combination, while functional, does not significantly advance the field or offer a new perspective on food recommendation challenges.\n\nTo make this work more impactful, I suggest the authors consider recent innovative approaches in food recommendation that extend beyond collaborative filtering and embeddings. For example, multi-objective optimization frameworks, such as those used by Gao et al. (2022), optimize for both health goals and user satisfaction simultaneously. Additionally, reinforcement learning-based recommender systems that adjust recommendations based on real-time user feedback could provide a more adaptive approach than static collaborative filtering models. Moreover, incorporating multi-view learning or multi-modal embeddings (e.g., combining user activity data, time of day, and food availability) could help capture a richer, context-aware recommendation space. These techniques, documented in recent studies like Zitouni et al. (2022), might allow the system to adapt recommendations dynamically, responding to factors that influence dietary choices.\n\nFurther innovation could be achieved through novel adaptations of existing methods. For example, graph-based models that map both food similarity and nutritional content in a unified framework could provide a complex, relational approach, setting this work apart from traditional collaborative filtering. These alternative formulations would help the authors demonstrate stronger novelty, particularly if they compared the proposed system against these advanced approaches. By exploring or incorporating some of these techniques, the paper could provide a more compelling case for its system\u2019s uniqueness and address the observed gaps in novelty. This would help strengthen its contribution to the development of food recommender systems that support healthier dietary choices.\n\nThe evaluation does not incorporate essential metrics such as Hit Rate, which is particularly important for food recommendation systems because it directly measures the system's success in presenting items the user is likely to engage with. For a system focused on promoting healthier food choices, accurately predicting relevant items is crucial to encouraging adoption and sustained user interest. Including Hit Rate as an evaluation metric would provide insight into the recommendation system's accuracy and appeal. Additionally, an ablation study is needed to assess the contributions of each component of the system, helping to clarify the impact of the collaborative filtering methods, BERT embeddings, and nutritional scoring on the overall performance. This would provide a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. While the paper is structured and contains clear descriptions of the components involved, this clarity does not compensate for the lack of originality and rigorous evaluation. The overall presentation does not highlight any unique or insightful findings that would warrant further exploration or application.\n\nThe paper fails to address a substantial gap in the literature or offer a new solution that could influence the domain of food recommendations. Its contributions seem incremental rather than transformative, and the proposed system does not advance our understanding of dietary recommendation systems in a meaningful way. In conclusion, the paper does not sufficiently present novel contributions or robust evaluations that would warrant acceptance."
