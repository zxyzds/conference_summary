Many real objects preserve their properties under any rigid motion from the special Euclidean group SE(n).Embedded graphs were previously distinguished under such rigid motion or geometric isomorphism in R^n.\n\nExperimental noise motivates new Lipschitz continuous invariants so that perturbations of all vertices up to epsilon change the invariants up to a constant multiple of epsilon in a suitable metric, whose running time should polynomially depend on the number of unordered vertices. \n\nWe developed new complete invariants that are stable under noise, form a natural hierarchy, and distinguish all chemically different graphs in the QM9 database of 130K+ molecules within a few hours on a modest desktop.",

This is a strong statement an should be justified by a more expressive experiment than Fig. 6, e.g., considering more interesting chemical properties known for the QM9 dataset than number of atoms.

This is mirrored in many other definitions, where the reader only understands later why they were useful definitions and presented at this particular point in the paper.

I however don't believe that this is a good guiding principle for ICLR papers.)\n* While the paper is technically solid in general, there are many minor technical issues in the definitions or the wording, see my minor comments below.\n* It is not easy to follow the main part of the paper. In particular, the definitions of the nested bottleneck metric and the nested centred distribution provided are not, combined with the following notational problem: The definition of the centred distribution depends on the order h, i.e. CD_{h-1}(...) is defined differently than CD_{k-1}(...) for other k. However, this implicit order h does not appear in the notation. For example CD^h_{k} would solve this problem.\n* There are over 8 different acronyms used throughout this paper.
