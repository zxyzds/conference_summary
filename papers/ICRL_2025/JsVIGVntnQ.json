    "title": "Empowering LLM Agents with Zero-Shot Optimal Decision-Making through Q-learning",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive text data to gain general comprehension capability. Current LLM agents leverage this ability to make zero- or few-shot decisions but fail in making optimal decisions, as LLMs inherently perform next-token prediction based on pre-trained probability distributions rather than maximizing expected future rewards. In contrast, agents trained via reinforcement learning (RL) could make optimal decisions but require extensive environmental data. In this work, we develop an algorithm that combines the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs with the optimal decision-making advantages of RL, referred to as the Model-based LLM Agent with Q-Learning (MLAQ). MLAQ employs Q-learning to derive optimal policies from transitions within memory. However, unlike RL agents that collect data from environmental interactions, MLAQ constructs an imagination space fully based on LLM to perform imaginary interactions for deriving zero-shot policies. Our proposed UCB variant generates imaginary data through interactions with the LLM-based world model, enabling a balance between exploration and exploitation while ensuring a sub-linear regret bound guaranteed by a theorem. Moreover, MLAQ employs a mixed-examination mechanism that utilizes environmental interactions and LLM-based self-examine to enhance the quality of imaginary data. We evaluate MLAQ in benchmarks that present significant challenges for existing LLM agents. Results show that MLAQ achieves a optimal rate of over 90% in tasks where other methods struggle to succeed. Additional experiments are conducted to reach the conclusion that introducing model-based RL into LLM agents shows significant potential for current LLMs to improve their optimal decision-making ability.

Specifically, under what conditions does MLAQ guarantee convergence to an optimal policy?\n\n2. Given that MLAQ relies heavily on the LLM's self-examination for correcting imaginary transitions, how robust is the framework in handling LLM hallucinations? Have you explored scenarios where the LLM produces incorrect or inconsistent outputs, and if so, how does MLAQ mitigate this risk?\n\n3. Could you discuss how sensitive MLAQ\u2019s performance is to the hyperparameters used in the UCB variant (e.g., coefficients and confidence bounds)? Understanding this could help gauge the stability and generality of the method across different domains.\n\n4. The MLAQ framework appears computationally intensive due to iterative Q-learning and the replay buffer management. Could you elaborate on the computational demands of MLAQ relative to traditional LLM agents? Are there strategies within the framework to reduce this overhead?\n\n5. Have you tested MLAQ in more open-ended or unstructured environments, such as robotic tasks with real-world constraints (e.g., noisy sensors, dynamic obstacles)? If not, do you foresee any limitations or necessary modifications to make the model applicable to such environments?\n\n6. Could you share insights on the types of tasks or domains where MLAQ may struggle to achieve optimal decision-making? Understanding these limitations can help contextualize the framework\u2019s applicability.\n\n7. Do you see potential for enhancing the LLM-based self-examination process, perhaps by combining it with non-LLM-based checks? For instance, could integrating environmental feedback more dynamically (e.g., through real-time adaptive learning) reduce reliance on the LLM\u2019s introspective accuracy?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My biggest concern is about the cost of this framework. While the paper claims that the MLAQ framework can operate without direct interaction with environmental tools by leveraging an LLM-based imagination space, this approach may still incur significant computational and financial costs. LLM interactions, especially those involving step-by-step task simulations, are resource-intensive in terms of both token usage and processing time. Additionally, in ablation experiments, tasks with 8 steps in BlocksWorld were shown to consume at least 40k tokens, which may be expensive for scaling up to complex tasks or multi-agent scenarios. The reliance on LLMs for generating and validating transitions could offset the savings from not interacting with real environments, especially if these transitions require multiple iterations for accuracy.\n\n2. Although MLAQ aims to minimize reliance on real-world data, it still requires occasional feedback from the environment to correct inaccuracies in LLM-generated transitions. In Algorithm 1, it seems the stepwise reward is still from the environment. Then, how does the model deal with sparse or delayed reward situation, e.g. in Figure 3 you can only get binary reward at the last step? In this way, the LLM world model is only used for simulate success trajectories or also provide reward? \n\n3. The LLM-based world model is designed to act as a proxy for real environmental interactions, but this approach may have inherent limitations, especially for tasks requiring high-fidelity simulations or complex physical dynamics. To be more specific, LLMs understanding of actions and outcomes might not always align with real-world behaviors. Does author have more analysis on this?"

                "value": "1. Since the LLM here serves as a model-based simulator of the real environment and the policy is generated by the Q-function, is it appropreiate to call this \"LLM agent\"? The action or policy is not diorectly generated by LLM, could this framework be more accurately described as a Q-learning agent that uses an LLM-based world model?\n\n2. I'm still unclear about what the training data is for Q-planner. Is it trained on the synthetic step-wise reward or the ground truth trajectories which is from the interaction with environment?"

I tried reading parts of the paper several times, but I unfortunately still don't understand truly how the method works. The writing seems both hard to follow/understand and missing important information. (I have published papers in the realm of LLMs, LLM agents, Q-learning/reinforcement learning, and model-based RL, so I should have sufficient background to understand the submission.)\n\nIt's hard to go through every part of the paper and describe what is hard to follow or missing, but here are a few examples:\n- In the intro: It\u2019s not clear what problem statement this paper is aiming to address. The sentences do not have a clear train-of-thought, and concepts are introduced without fully explaining them / without giving concrete examples.\n- Important details are missing: how is the Q-function represented? The preliminaries describe a tabular representation, but this doesn\u2019t seem applicable to the language setting. Is there a policy improvement step using the Q-function? If so, how is it done? How do each of the components interact? What concretely is the action space being considered? What is the breadth of the actions that the LLM can take?\n- The term \u201cenvironmental tools\u201d is used extensively, but it\u2019s not entirely clear what it means. It hasn't been used in prior papers to my knowledge, and isn't described clearly in this paper. It reminds me of LLM \"tools\", but based on the brief description in the intro, this seems incorrect and it seems to more be referring to assumptions that the method makes.\n- The paper is not self-contained, and assumes detailed knowledge of specific prior works, e.g. Mandi et al to understand the RoCo task.\n- The figures are helpful, but quite abstract\n- The abstract refers to a website (https://mlaq.site/) that is empty\n- Qualitative examples of the agent performance would be helpful\n- Which LLM is used in the experiments? How large is it?\n\n\nSecondarily, the method is very complex involving many different components. This fact combined with the lack of clarity in the paper means that it would be impossible to implement the method based on the description in the paper. I appreciate the ablation study though."
