    "abstract": "Theory of Mind (ToM) presents a significant generalization challenge in computational modeling. This paper explores how neural networks with varying architectures and training regimes learn and represent ToM-related features. We introduce a novel method for quantifying feature representation within neural networks and apply it to a set of theoretically-grounded features designed to differentiate between hypothesized ToM strategies. We examine the relationship between feature representation and task accuracy across different model architectures and training datasets. This work provides insights into the mechanisms underlying ToM capabilities in neural networks and offers a framework for future research in computational ToM.",

                "value": "The authors investigate different theory of mind capabilities in AI models by training the models on a theory-of-mind task from the cognitive science literature and investigate their learned internal representations to produce specific features of interests in the task. They do this through training linear or MLP-based probes from the intermediate layer activity (either all layers or just the final layer). The authors test an MLP, CNN, and CNN-LSTM on this task. The results are a bit mixed, but a common theme seemed to be that the CNN-LSTM performs the best at learning generalizable features relevant to the task."

Only a simple MLP, CNN, and CNN-LSTM. The main result showing the CNN-LSTM encodes some low and high mindreading features may just be due to the architecture having intrinsically more parameters, nothing about the underlying method being better aligned with theory of mind (which may be possible, but this paper doesn't necessarily show that).\n\n* The task is a highly simplified theory-of-mind paradigm. This may not be an issue inofitself, but the models too are highly simple models. This could be ok if one was using foundation models trained on a large body of data, where we have some reason to believe that the model could potentially develop something like theory of mind. However, if all the authors are doing is training tabula-rasa CNNs and LSTMs trained on just this small task, the models are probably learning something much more low-level than genuine theory of mind. \n\n* The main innovation of this work is supposedly the feature-based analysis. However, a lot of people have been using this both in machine learning (probing analysis) and neuroscience/cognitive science (decoder models). Given this, there's not much innovative about this paper. \n\n* The task, as well as the relevant features being decoded, is a little confusing. It would be helpful to have a schematic that shows what inputs the model is getting and what the different steps of the task are."

The originality of the paper lies primarily in its attempt to define and measure self-awareness in artificial systems\u2014a challenging topic that brings together insights from cognitive science and machine learning. This interdisciplinary approach adds an interesting theoretical dimension to the machine learning community, potentially sparking new conversations about the nature of advanced AI capabilities.\n\nThe authors also aim to propose an explainable framework for identifying self-awareness traits, which is a commendable effort. Explainability is crucial for understanding complex neural models, and the authors\u2019 focus on making the concept of self-awareness interpretable could lead to advancements in both understanding language models and ensuring their safe deployment. This attempt, if successful, could contribute to a more reliable and transparent AI development process.\n\nIn terms of significance, the paper is ambitious in trying to evaluate whether machine learning models can exhibit a form of introspection. This work could lay the groundwork for future research aimed at enhancing model behavior in terms of reliability, consistency, and robustness, potentially making AI systems more aligned with human-level cognitive functions. The attempt to enhance these capabilities through fine-tuning techniques also suggests a potential practical path forward, which could inspire follow-up work aimed at improving models in specific use cases.\n\nThe experiments, although lacking in some details, provide an initial attempt to evaluate the proposed ideas. The integration of self-reflective tasks and the use of fine-tuning approaches to promote self-awareness are noteworthy, as they present a creative way to explore model behavior beyond conventional benchmarks.\n\nOverall, the originality of combining theoretical considerations of self-awareness with empirical approaches, and the authors' attempt to create an explainable framework, are valuable contributions that could push the boundaries of current work on language model introspection."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has several areas that need improvement, particularly regarding the clarity of its methodology, the consistency of its presentation, and the depth of empirical analysis. Below are the major weaknesses, along with specific recommendations for improvement:\n\n### Lack of Methodological Detail and Formalism\n\n1. **Explainable Framework Insufficiently Described**  \n   The paper introduces an \"explainable framework\" to understand self-awareness traits in language models but does not provide enough detail about how this framework works. There is no formal or quantitative explanation, such as equations or metrics, to make the explainable approach reproducible and verifiable. Including well-defined metrics, a clearer methodology, or a visual example to illustrate how this framework identifies and measures self-awareness traits is crucial to improve transparency and rigor.\n\n2. **Insufficient Empirical Motivation**  \n   The paper focuses heavily on the concept of self-awareness, but it lacks a strong empirical justification for why self-awareness is essential for language models. Providing practical examples where self-awareness leads to improved model performance, robustness, or specific downstream benefits would help establish its relevance. Moreover, including an experiment demonstrating the practical impact of self-awareness would significantly strengthen the argument.\n\n3. **Inadequate Experimental Details**  \n   There are numerous shortcomings in the description of the experiments, which undermine their reproducibility and the significance of the findings:\n   - The dataset used for the self-reflection tasks is not explicitly mentioned, making it challenging to assess the suitability of the dataset for evaluating self-awareness.\n   - Key training settings, such as hyperparameter tuning, baseline comparisons, and experimental setups, are absent. Including these details is necessary to ensure that the experiments can be understood and replicated.\n   - In Section 3.2, \"extraction models\" are introduced for the first time, but the description of their working process is insufficient. Adding a detailed flowchart or diagram to show how the extraction models interact with the task models would provide much-needed clarity on the methodology.\n\n### Inconsistencies in Presentation and Logical Flow\n\n1. **Delayed Definition of Core Concepts**  \n   The definitions of \"no-mindreading,\" \"low-mindreading,\" and \"high-mindreading\" are introduced in Section 4.1, yet Figure 1 in Section 3.4 already refers to two of these terms. This inconsistency disrupts the logical flow of the paper. Moving the definitions earlier, ideally before Figure 1, would make the narrative clearer and easier to follow.\n\n2. **Figure Clarity Issues**  \n   In Figure 1, the overlapping of error bars between the outlined and filled bars creates ambiguity, making it difficult for readers to distinguish between different data points. This overlap could lead to misinterpretation. To improve clarity, consider redesigning the figure, possibly by using different visual styles or presenting the data in separate plots.\n\n### Conceptual Ambiguities and Assumptions\n\n1. **Unclear Accuracy Definition**  \n   The concept of accuracy for feature extraction is not sufficiently explained. Specifically, it is unclear how the extraction models determine the accuracy of extracted features, and what this accuracy actually represents in terms of the physical interpretation of the features. Providing a concrete example that illustrates how accuracy is calculated and what it implies in terms of model behavior would greatly help the reader understand its significance.\n\n2. **Unverified Assumption in Feature Representation**  \n   The paper's experimental setup is based on an assumption that extraction models predict features in a way that correlates with the task model's ability to use those features:  \n   > *\"We assume that, because these models might extract connectionist features in the same manner that a task-model\u2019s internal layers might, their ability to predict a given feature corresponds with the task-model\u2019s ability to use that feature.\"*  \n   \n   This assumption is critical to the validity of the experimental results, yet it is not explicitly validated. To strengthen the argument, the authors should include experiments or evidence demonstrating that the extraction models\u2019 accuracy does indeed correspond to the task model\u2019s feature representation capabilities. Without such verification, the results are built on a speculative foundation.\n\n### Writing and Clarity\n\n1. **Overly Lengthy Background**  \n   The introduction and early parts of the paper focus too heavily on philosophical motivations and background, taking up significant space without contributing substantially to the research's core contributions. The background could be condensed, allowing more room for detailed methodological and experimental explanations.\n\n2. **Ambiguities and Unpolished Sections**  \n   Several parts of the paper are ambiguous or poorly polished:\n   - Line 119 states, \"if it believes the larger treat is somewhere, it will claim that box, preventing the player from getting whatever treat is inside. Otherwise\u2026\" without specifying the conditions under which the opponent does not believe the larger treat is somewhere. Clarifying these conditions is essential to help the reader understand the training rules.\n   - The transition from the background to the core contributions of the paper is abrupt, leading to a disjointed narrative. The flow of the paper should be adjusted to ensure a smoother transition between the theoretical motivation and the practical approach.\n  \n### Lack of Quantitative Tools and Statistical Analysis\n\n1. **Absence of Quantitative Formalism**  \n   There is a notable lack of formal quantitative tools throughout the paper. For example, including equations, precise metrics, or a well-defined framework would add rigor and support the explainable approach claims. Explainability should be measurable, and its effects should be evaluated quantitatively.\n\n2. **No Statistical Significance in Results**  \n   The results of the experiments are presented without statistical analysis. For instance, there are no confidence intervals or significance tests provided to support claims regarding the effect of fine-tuning. Including statistical analysis would make the results more credible and help to substantiate the claims about the impact of the proposed methods."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. **Lack of a Core Framework Diagram**  \n   The paper does not include a core framework diagram that visually outlines the approach, which makes it challenging to understand the overall method and how the components interact. Could you provide a high-level architectural diagram of the proposed approach, including the explainable framework, data inputs, and the fine-tuning process? A diagram would greatly help in understanding how these elements are connected.\n\n2. **Unclear Connection Between Methodology and Experiments**  \n   Given that the methodological descriptions are quite vague, it is difficult to assess how the various experiments relate to the explainable framework and the goal of enhancing self-awareness. Can you clarify how each of the experiments ties into the central framework you proposed? For instance, are the results from each experiment meant to evaluate distinct components of the framework, or are they aimed at validating the approach as a whole?\n\n3. **Definition and Operationalization of Self-Awareness**  \n   The concept of self-awareness is central to the paper, but it remains vague in practical terms. Could you provide a more precise, operational definition of self-awareness in this context? Is it related to the model\u2019s ability to evaluate uncertainty, recognize its prior states, or something else entirely? How is self-awareness measured quantitatively in your experiments?\n\n4. **Explainable Framework Details**  \n   The paper refers to an \"explainable approach\" but does not detail how explainability is ensured. Can you provide additional information about the mechanisms or metrics used to ensure that the model\u2019s behavior is explainable? For example, are you using specific attribution techniques, saliency maps, or feature importance metrics?\n\n5. **Details of the Self-Reflection Tasks**  \n   In Section 3, you mention using self-reflection tasks for fine-tuning to enhance self-awareness. Could you elaborate on how these tasks were constructed and why they were chosen? Are they designed to mirror specific human-like introspective behaviors? Providing examples would help in understanding the motivation and relevance of these tasks.\n\n6. **Practical Relevance of Self-Awareness**  \n   The paper provides a theoretical motivation for self-awareness but does not establish its practical significance. Could you elaborate on the concrete benefits of a self-aware language model in practical applications? For example, how might self-awareness improve performance in typical NLP tasks, and how can this be quantified or demonstrated?\n\n7. **Quantitative Framework or Metrics**  \n   There is no formal quantitative framework for evaluating self-awareness or explainability. Are there plans to include mathematical formalism to back up the claims regarding the presence and enhancement of self-awareness in the model? Quantitative metrics such as attribution scores, feature importance, or performance improvements in downstream tasks would add credibility to your findings.\n\n8. **Statistical Analysis of Results**  \n   The paper does not provide statistical analysis for the results presented. Could you provide more information about whether the observed effects are statistically significant? For instance, have you computed confidence intervals or p-values for the comparison between the fine-tuned and baseline models? Including such analysis would help validate the robustness of the results.\n\n9. **Parameter Tuning and Reproducibility**  \n   The experimental setup lacks key details regarding hyperparameter tuning and training settings. Can you provide more information on how parameters were tuned across different models and tasks? Were the same settings used for baselines to ensure fair comparisons? This information is essential for assessing reproducibility and the validity of the conclusions drawn.\n\n10. **Generalization to Other Language Models**  \n    The experiments are conducted on a specific language model architecture, but it is unclear whether the findings generalize to other architectures. Have you tested this approach on different types of models, such as transformer-based architectures or smaller-scale models? Generalizing these findings would strengthen the overall contribution and applicability of the proposed method.\n\n11. **Theoretical Justification of the Fine-Tuning Impact**  \n    The paper claims that fine-tuning enhances the self-awareness traits of the model, but this impact lacks theoretical explanation. Could you elaborate on why fine-tuning with self-reflective tasks is expected to enhance self-awareness? Providing a theoretical basis or citing relevant literature would strengthen this claim.\n\n12. **Clarification of Video Dimensions**  \n    In line 125, the paper states: \"We use this setting as a source of data for supervised learning; each datapoint is collected from a single trial of five timesteps, or a (5, 5, 7, 7)-sized video.\" Could you clarify what the dimensions (5, 5, 7, 7) specifically represent? Understanding this would help in interpreting the data used in your experiments more accurately.\n\n13. **Missing IFR Scores in Figures 1 and 2**  \n    In Figures 1 and 2, the data for the \"Stage 3 training\" column only contains outlined bars representing the IFR scores for familiar tasks, while there are no filled bars for the IFR scores for novel tasks. Does this imply that the filled bars are nonexistent, or were they excluded for another reason? Providing an explanation or adding this to the figure description would help in avoiding confusion and make the interpretation of results clearer."
