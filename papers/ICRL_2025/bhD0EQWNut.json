    "title": "Naturality-Guided Hyperedge Disentanglement for Message Passing Hypergraph Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Hypergraph data structure has been widely used to store information or meaning derived from group interactions, meaning that each hyperedge inherently contains the context of their interactions. For example, a set of genes or a genetic pathway can be represented as a hyperedge to express the interaction of multiple genes that collaboratively perform a biological function (i.e., interaction context). However, most existing hypergraph neural networks cannot reflect the interaction context of each hyperedge due to their limited capability in capturing important or relevant factors therein. In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{simple but effective} hyperedge disentangling method, \\textbf{Natural-HNN}, that captures inherent hyperedge types or the interaction context of an hyperedge. We devised a novel guidance for hyperedge disentanglement based on the naturality condition in the category theory. In our experiments, we applied our model to hypergraphs of genetic pathways for the cancer subtype classification task, and showed that our model outperforms baselines by capturing the functional semantic similarity of genetic pathways.",

It would be more compelling if Figure 1 were related to the genetic pathways experiment.\n- The authors assert that a drawback of sheaf-based methods is that \"there is no guidance that helps the transformation to be related to interaction context.\" However, they do not explain why this is a drawback or why such guidance is important.\n- The introduction is verbose, and portions of it could be more appropriately placed in the related works section.\n- Section 3 and Figure 2 are positioned too closely, making the text difficult to follow.\n- In Section 5, the authors state, \"there is no benchmark dataset verified to contain useful interaction context that is related to the task.\" If this is the case, the motivation for the proposed method is unclear.\n- The model performance shown in Table 1 does not significantly surpass the other baselines.\n- Although the authors claim to have an effective hyperedge disentangling method, they need to demonstrate that they have addressed the disentanglement problem in their experiments."
