    "title": "Scaling up the Banded Matrix Factorization Mechanism for Large Scale Differentially Private ML",
    "abstract": "Correlated noise mechanisms such as DP Matrix Factorization (DP-MF) have proven to be effective alternatives to DP-SGD in large-epsilon few-epoch training regimes.  Significant work has been done to find the best correlated noise strategies, and the current state-of-the-art approach is DP-BandMF , which optimally balances the benefits of privacy amplification and noise correlation.  Despite it's utility advantages, severe scalability limitations prevent this mechanism from handling large-scale training scenarios where the number of training iterations may be more than $10^4$ and the number of model parameters may exceed $10^7$.  In this work, we present techniques to scale up DP-BandMF along these two dimensions, significantly extending it's reach and enabling it to effectively handle settings with over $10^6$ training iterations and $10^9$ model parameters, with no utility degradation at smaller scales.",

                "value": "The paper studies a mechanism (DP-BandMF) for private machine learning that has advantages over the standard private mechanism (DP-SGD) in some regimes due to its use of optimized correlated noise. The algorithm is characterized by a strategy matrix that determines the correlational structure of the noise.\n\nThis work identifies the optimization of the stategy matrix is a computational bottleneck limiting the applicability of DP-BandMF. Prior work gives an $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space algorithm, which is impractical for large values of $n$. This work improves the running time to $O(bn^2)$ and the space to $O(bn)$ where the band size $b$ characterizes the level of correlation allowed between noise vectors. The authors go on to give a further improved $O(bn)$ time $O(n)$ space algorithm for a restricted class of strategies.\n\nThe authors conclude with a series of experiments that assess the scalability and solution quality of their algorithm, the optimal band-size, as well as the suitability of the RMSE measure optimized by their algorithm as a proxy for utility loss."

It is unclear whether there is an inherent limitation of this approach or if there is room for meaningful improvement in gradient computation efficiency.\n\nA more significant weakness of this work is somewhat limited technical novelty in the results. The primary technical contribution appears to be Algorithm 3, which leverages sparsity and computes the objective in a streaming fashion.\n\nThe authors do extend their results in Proposition 3.1 to a new setting involving Toeplitz strategies. This result is nice but I found the following motivation not fully convincing: \"This design decision was inspired by manual inspection of the optimal dense strategies, observing that they exhibit a near-Toeplitz structure.\" While this choice seems bolstered by by the result in Figure 1(a), a more careful theoretical justification would be welcome, if possible."
