    "title": "Continuous Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion models",
    "abstract": "Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.",

Because we can simply represent the forecast outputs as a vector of a length N. Then we can use a Gaussian vector to yield forecasts. \n- is there a significant difference between weather forecasting and general time series forecasting?\n- what is the input size (the number of variables) of the model in the experiments? It seems there are many variables in the weather forecasting task. Did you perform univariate forecasting tasks for each variable?   \n- how to fuse $n_{ens}$ trajectories to get the final predictions?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper lacks references to closely related methods, such as Zheng et al. (2023) on fast sampling of diffusion models via operator learning, which shares similarities with the proposed model\u2019s sampling approach. It would be beneficial to clarify how the proposed sampling method diverges from these approaches.\n\nAlthough not directly used for weather data, recent models like Dyfusion, Alternator, and Mamba (with s-mamba used specifically for weather forecasting) have shown promise in similar domains, such as sea surface temperature forecasting. Including these models as baselines or discussing their relevance could offer a more comprehensive comparison, illustrating where this model stands relative to other contemporary approaches.\n\nThe paper mentions \u201cregularity conditions\u201d (e.g., Line 234) without specifying them rigorously. These conditions are fundamental to claims about trajectory continuity and temporal stability of forecasts. A formal mathematical description of these conditions, alongside proof or empirical validation, would be necessary to substantiate these claims.\n\nThe claims regarding fixed noise across time steps and ODE-based interpolation are under-supported. No mathematical evidence or ablation study is presented to show the impact of fixing noise on forecasting performance. Including such a study could clarify the advantages of this design choice.\n\nThe proposed Algorithm 2 seems tailored to a specific diffusion model setup. It would be valuable to discuss whether this algorithm generalizes to other diffusion models or is fundamentally limited to the framework outlined in the paper. A broader discussion on this topic could enhance the paper\u2019s applicability to related models.\n\nThe results lack completeness, as only two of the five variables used for forecasting are presented in Table 2. Including comparisons for all five variables would provide a clearer picture of the model's strengths and weaknesses across different atmospheric variables.\n\nThe absence of error bars due to computational limitations weakens the robustness of the reported results. Given the probabilistic nature of the model, showcasing variability over multiple runs would offer greater confidence in the findings. Including error bars or confidence intervals for at least a subset of key results would be helpful, even if computational constraints prevent a complete assessment.\n\nNumerous claims about model performance, such as trajectory continuity, lack rigorous mathematical proof and appear to rely on empirical observations. Addressing this would lend greater theoretical robustness to the proposed model.\n\nThere is no mathematical derivation for the training objective and loss function. A step-by-step derivation of these, with explanations of any modifications relative to standard diffusion model objectives and the rationale for these modifications in the weather forecasting context, would clarify the theoretical foundation of the approach."

But what is the assumption behind the customized ODE in Eq. (2)? Why is there a linear noise level $sigma$ in Eq. (2)? What if $\\sigma^2$? More explanation would help. \n- From the paper title and section 4 name, \"CONTINUOUS\" seems to be used to describe $ensemble forecasting$. However, what the authors really want to convey is the temporal continuity, i.e., any arbitrary fine temporal resolution. You may need to think over the rephrasing. Otherwise, it is confusing for readers (at least for me).\n- In Figure 1, do you need to include the 1-hour prediction as the input for the 6-hour prediction? I saw you have explanations in sections 3 and 4. But Figure 1 deserves a more precise description within its title since it is the main framework of your method.\n- It would be better to provide more comparisons with previous SOTA ML models. Even though I know not all models did not release source codes to the public, but some did, e.g., FourCastNet and ClimaX. \n- The authors mentioned the limitation of diffusion models: computationally expensive. I suggest adding more analysis of computational efficiency.\n\n**Minor:**\n- You are using the letter 'k' for different representations (see Eq. 1 and Alg. 1).\n- It is customary to denote a time point with the superscript or subscript. It looks like a function if using $X[k+1]$ or $X(\\tau)$.\n- In the line under Eq. (2), why is $z(1)$ for $X[k+1]$? Isn't it the number of diffusion steps or the noise levels?\n- What is $v_i^{k}$ in Algorithm 2?"
