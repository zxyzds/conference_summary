    "title": "BRAIN: Behavioral Responses and Artificial Intelligence Neural-Modeling for Consumer Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "This research investigates consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing through a multivariate methodology, employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and deep learning neural networks to interpret consumer responses to functional products. EEG signals were collected, recorded, and analyzed from 16 individuals aged 20 to 29 to identify significant neuronal markers related to consumer choices. The pivotal factors influencing decision-making were identified as the low beta and low gamma frequency bands, as well as participants' attention and meditation levels. The findings validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its applicability across various fields requiring accurate and reliable classification. Additionally, it is recommended to explore the potential applications of this study in the food industry by creating personalized nutrition strategies based on individuals' brain activity patterns.",

                "value": "The reviewer encountered significant challenges in understanding the manuscript due to the unclear writing style exhibited by the authors, despite her/his expertise as a practitioner in EEG and BCI. Analyzing the EEG time-series presented in Figure 2, it appears that the authors lack a fundamental understanding of EEG amplitudes and the distinction between samples and seconds as units. Furthermore, the authors attempt to integrate EEG data with facial and food product images into a singular machine learning model, employing a simplistic application of PCA. This amalgamation raises substantial questions regarding the model's intended function, particularly in relation to the handling of potential movement artifacts. Additionally, there seems to be a conflation of EEG and BCI terminology within the methodology section, indicating a limited comprehension of the subject matter. Regrettably, these issues lead to a recommendation for outright rejection of the submission."

Instead, it reads more like a general document on the use of EEG in consumer choice analysis without clarifying the specific approach or objectives of the present work. Furthermore, the introduction consists of a single paragraph with little conceptual linkage between the topics covered. A clearer structure and a more coherent explanation of the purpose and methodology of the research are needed to explain in the introduction.\n\nThe study only considers the sensory or taste aspects of the product as the primary factor influencing consumer preferences, which is insufficient to provide valuable insights for the food industry in the context of product development. A more comprehensive assessment that includes additional factors such as texture, aroma, visual appeal and emotional response would provide a more complete understanding of consumer preferences and increase the relevance of the study to the industry\n\nSections 2.2 to 2.3.4 of the paper primarily resemble tutorials on EEG signals and their acquisition processes rather than focused discussions relevant to the study's research questions.\n\nThere is no related work provided on the existing studies on the given topic.\n\nOverall, this manuscript lacks the scholarly depth and clarity expected of a research paper. The presentation of ideas is often unclear and insufficient attention is paid to structure, coherence and technical detail necessary to effectively communicate the research objectives, methodology and results."

An entire hyperparameter table along with data augmentation strategies would be useful in further increasing reproduction and clarity.\n\nOveremphasis on Beta and Gamma Bands: Though beta and gamma rhythms are relevant to decision-making, excessive concentration may neglect other EEG components that could be significant for consumer preferences."

A comparison would explain the advantages and disadvantages of your proposed method.\n\nDo you ever validate the model on larger or different datasets? Because the participant pool is so small, these may provide further evidences about the generalizability and performance of your model in other contexts."
