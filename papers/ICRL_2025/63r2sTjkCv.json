    "abstract": "DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) are combinatorial small molecule libraries that offer an efficient way to characterize diverse chemical spaces. Selection experiments using DELs are pivotal to drug discovery efforts, enabling high-throughput screens for hit finding. However, limited availability of public DEL datasets hinders the advancement of computational techniques designed to process such data. To bridge this gap, we present KinDEL, one of the first large, publicly available DEL datasets on two kinases: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (MAPK14) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (DDR1). Interest in this data modality is growing due to its ability to generate extensive supervised chemical data that densely samples around select molecular structures. Demonstrating one such application of the data, we benchmark different machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for hit identification; in particular, we highlight recent structure-based probabilistic approaches. Finally, we provide biophysical assay data, both on- and off-DNA, to validate our models on a smaller subset of molecules. Data and code for our benchmarks can be found at: https://kin-del-2024.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kindel.zip",

                "value": "1. The evaluation is limited to only two kinase targets, MAPK14 and DDR1. Given that both targets are kinases, this dataset may have limited generalizability as a benchmark for models applied to broader, non-kinase targets.\n2. The data-splitting method may ensure that compounds with the same disynthon do not end up in the same split, but it doesn\u2019t fully prevent similar compounds from being grouped together, as disynthons do not necessarily represent the core structure of small molecules. Other approaches, such as scaffold-based or overall molecular similarity-based splits, may yield a more robust assessment.\n3. Presentation Improvements: The table headers are somewhat confusing, making it unclear what the numbers in the table represent without reading the text. In Figure 3, \"SP\u00b3\" should be corrected to \"sp\u00b3\" for accuracy."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Why use AI to reduce data noise? If DEL diverges significantly from reality, it may indicate instability or unsuitability for the current task. AI-based discriminative models are inherently inaccurate to some extent, so how effective is it to use one inaccurate method to adjust for another?\n2. More explanation is needed for why certain chemical properties in Figure 3 are considered \"drug-like\". For instance, the molecular weight peak exceeds the traditional threshold of 500, and the QED values are relatively low.\n3. Why is on-DNA data significant here, when off-DNA structures are more relevant for practical applications like drug development? On-DNA structures are unlikely to be developed as drugs.\n4. Why didn\u2019t the authors test more end-to-end models? Also, why did they use Morgan fingerprints as input instead of molecular representations like SMILES strings (1D), molecular graphs (2D), or atomic coordinates (3D)?"

I believe the insight provided by the authors would make the benchmark more solid and comprehensive. \n2. The proposed experiments including general performance (Table1, and Table2), and the visualization of experimental replicates are somehow not comprehensive enough. Serving as a benchmark for the DEL-community, more views and new settings are required, such as case study of top-ranking candidates (which can be potential candidates for real-world application), subset-Spearman coefficient (which is proposed in the paper \"DEL-Dock: Molecular Docking-Enabled Modeling of DNA-Encoded Libraries\" [1]), and potential effect of chemical properties and data source selections (building blocks) to the method performances on the KinDEL dataset. Then, the multi-view perspective of the benchmark could lead to larger contribution to the community. \n\nReference:\n1. Shmilovich K, Chen B, Karaletsos T, et al.

Spearman coefficient can reach over 0.7, which is a very promising result,  but in paper \"DEL-Dock: Molecular Docking-Enabled Modeling of DNA-Encoded Libraries\" [1], there's an another proposed dataset containing Fingerprint and docking poses, where existing methods can only achieve relatively poor performance (around 0.30 w.r.t. negative Spearman coefficient) compared to KinDEL dataset. May the authors explain what is the inner differeneces between two datasets that leads to the obvious differences between two datasets? I also believe this comparison can make this work more solid as the contributing benchmark. \n2. Is it possible to provide an advanced version of KinDEL dataset with machine-aided of molecule docking poses. I understand it's very time-consuming and CPU-resource costly, but the DEL dataset with 1D and 3D modalities would lead to wider applications and evaluations to this community. Considering the potential cost, I believe it is also great to have dataset with only fingerprint (1D) information of the molecules. \n\nReference:\n1. Shmilovich K, Chen B, Karaletsos T, et al.
