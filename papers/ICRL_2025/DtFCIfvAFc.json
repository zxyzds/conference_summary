    "abstract": "Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car \u2013 it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.",

Theorem 1 is directly from the existing theorem. No need to include here. It is also confusing where this theorem is used anywhere in the paper. The equations are sloppy. Notations are a mess. The features\nused two notations F and f. F^{cand} is not defined. f^{part} is also never defined anywhere in the paper. The equations from (6), (7), (11) need motivation and clarification.\n\n- The experimental setting is not clearly defined. The authors used a dataset originally for 3D object detection in Nerf. It is not clear how the point cloud based methods, which need a point cloud input, are used in the experiment comparison.\n\n- The qualitative examples of the proposed method show the quality of the 3D boxes is sometimes a lot worse than other competing methods. The boxes are often bigger and quite off. The competing methods also show many overlapping bounding boxes. No non-max suppression This may cause the lower numbers from the competing methods."

The method uses Gaussian as a surface descriptor and introduces the Closure Inference Module (CIM), which solves the outlier problem inherent in the 3DGS method by considering surface closure as a prior for objectness. The CIM operates in two phases: firstly, the probabilistic feature residuals are estimated for some of the surfaces, and then they are merged to form a holistic representation that measures the overall surface closure. The method is evaluated on synthetic (3D-FRONT) and real-world (ScanNet) datasets, and the results show a significant improvement over previous SOTA methods. The main innovations of the method are its surface-based representation and the use of surface closure as a geometric prior to improve the quality of detection."

                "value": "- Clarity of the paper is not good and needs improvement (my most concerning weakness). First, overall the high-level idea is not clearly explained. Although, Fig. 2 tries to do this, it falls short. Figure 2 lacks a clear illustration of the goal using the Backbone, and most importantly, fails to explain clearly how the CIM module (in my opinion the main contribution). Second, given the lack of clarity, it is hard to judge the novelty and quality of the solution. For example, I don't find the description of the Theorem if the high-level idea is not explained clearly. In my opinion it is just using space that could've been used to add Figures to explain CIM in a better way.\n\n- Lack of details in the experiments. First, in line 320-321, the narrative says that the scenes are manually downsized into 159 usable rooms. However, it is not clear if the data was verified to ensure high quality. This is important since this data is used to measure quality.\n \n- Insufficient experiments. In my opinion, showing results only on 2 datasets is not that convincing. Given that 3D object detection has been around for some time, it would've been more informative to know the performance of this proposed method on more real-scenes benchmarks/datasets (e.g., Waymo Open datasets, Objectron, etc.). I think that these datasets could've revealed the practical benefit of the proposed approach."
