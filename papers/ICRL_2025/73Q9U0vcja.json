    "title": "Diffusion Active Learning: Towards Data-Driven Experimental Design in Computed Tomography",
    "abstract": "We introduce _Diffusion Active Learning_, a novel approach that integrates a generative diffusion model with sequential experimental design to adaptively acquire data for solving inverse problems in imaging. We first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on domain-specific data. The diffusion model is aimed to capture the structure of the underlying data distribution, which is then leveraged in the active learning process. During the active learning loop, we use the forward model of the inverse problem together with the diffusion model to generate conditional data samples from the posterior distribution, all consistent with the current measurements. Based on the generated samples we quantify the uncertainty in the current estimate in order to select the most informative next measurement. We showcase the proposed approach for its application in X-ray computed tomography imaging. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in data acquisition requirements (_i.e._, lower X-ray dose) and improved image reconstruction quality across several real-world tomography datasets.",

                "value": "Context for those unfamiliar: Computed tomography (CT) acquires multiple X-ray _projection_ images of an object to reconstruct the 3D object. Due to ionizing radiation, there are significant risks associated with acquiring multiple X-ray viewing angles, leading to an undersampled ill-posed inverse problem. Many lines of work aim to reconstruct 3D CT using as few X-ray projections as possible.\n\nSubmission 10594 presents an active learning strategy to adaptively sample viewing angles most informative to the reconstruction, to reduce overall X-ray dosage. It first pretrains a diffusion model on fully sampled CTs from the same domain. Then, during inference, it uses the uncertainty of the posterior samples of the diffusion model to adaptively sample new angles.\n\nExperiments are presented on three simulated datasets, where the proposed diffusion-based method compares favorably to other generative models."

                "value": "I am open to changing my score and look forward to the rebuttal. As of now I see the following areas that should be addressed,\n\n## 1. The same method was presented in Elata, et al ECCV 2024\n\nThe submission has the same idea, methods, and subject matter as [Elata, et al ECCV 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08256). **This overlap does not affect my rating** as ICLR\u2019s reviewer guide states that papers that came online after Jul 1 count as contemporaneous and Elata et al first appeared on Jul 11. \n\nHowever, could the authors please enumerate the technical differences between the works such that readers can have clear takeaways from this paper? \n\nFor example, the acquisition function is different between the two papers, but their covariance-based acquisition function does seem to be inadvertently benchmarked in the Appendix of this submission as well and they perform identically.\n\n## 2. Limited experiments\n\nMy biggest reservation is w.r.t. the submission\u2019s limited experimental depth from the following aspects.\n\n### 2.1. Missing Active CT baselines\n\nWhile somewhat niche, active learning for CT reconstruction has been studied by previous works as well. For example,\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02420\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01670\n- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503161.3548204\n\nCould the authors please describe why these works were not discussed and/or benchmarked against in this submission? If it is feasible, it would be good to see experiments comparing the submission against them. Of course, it is understandable if this is not feasible given the limited discussion period.\n\n### 2.2. Only CT experiments\n\nAs the submission itself states, nothing in the submission is particularly specific to CT and it could just as well be used for other sensor-domain reconstruction problems such as MRI. As MRI is widely used, has a clear case for acceleration (patient comfort, time costs, etc.), and MRI active learning is more widely studied than CT active learning, is there a specific reason why it is not studied in this submission?\n\nFurther, there are several reinforcement learning methods cited in the paper for MRI active learning. Could any of them be also adapted for CT active learning to form benchmarks for this submission?\n\n### 2.3. No low-dose / sparse-view baseline(s)\n\nThe submission motivates itself by potentially reducing CT dosage. Low-dose and/or sparse-view CT reconstruction are immensely popular topics with both learned and hand-crafted priors used. However, the paper does not benchmark against any of the work within this field and instead only benchmarks against other sampling-based methods specifically constructed for this submission. \n\nWhile I understand that sampling view prediction and low-dose reconstruction are somewhat orthogonal and can be combined, the method in this paper _requires_ the use of a diffusion model. This then precludes the use of useful low-dose reconstruction methods based on priors such as total variation. \n\nCould the authors please discuss the differences between the proposed method and existing methods for low-dose reconstruction and whether regularizers such as TV can also be used in the proposed setup?\n\n### 2.4. Only simulated data\n\nWhile this is endemic across the field, the submission uses _only_ simulated synthetic X-ray projection data in its experiments, simulating it using the same exact forward model as it does in its model. As per the \u201cinverse crime\u201d phenomenon, this can create highly optimistic results and exaggerate differences between methods.\n\nWithin CT, there is a small set of datasets that provide both CT and raw _measured_ projection data. For example, please see:\n- https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ldct-and-projection-data/ (they provide scripts to rebin to fanbeam if necessary)\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0235-y\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02484-6\n\nAs detailed above, the paper could have also used active learning baselines for MRI and there are large datasets of real k-space measurements for MRI.\n\nCould the authors please detail why the experiments only use simulated projections?\n\n## 3. Technical contribution\n\nReductively speaking, the paper can be viewed as a combination of Hard Data Consistency (Song et al 2023) and uncertainty sampling. The submission instead proposes to use \u201csoft\u201d data consistency which is hard DC + early stopping, but it does not perform an ablation of this choice (please correct me if I missed it). As this is the primary technical delta, please perform an ablation if possible.\n\n## 4. Minor\n- Runtime requirements are not reported at all. As the paper is motivated by accelerating scans, it should quantify what the additional computational overhead boils down to.\n- L462: \u201con pair\u201d \u2192 \u201con par\u201d"

Then, the forward model is applied to each posterior sample to obtain the corresponding measurement at different angles. The uncertainty is represented as the variation in the measurements at each angle. Finally, the angle with the largest variation is selected as the next angle to collect measurements for.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The contributions of the paper were not explicitly clear to me. From the experiments, there were two independent variables that were changed: 1) the method used to generate samples and 2) the use of the active learning procedure. Is the main contribution the use of a diffusion model for the sampling procedure? Or is the main contribution the active learning procedure? Or is the combination of the two the main contribution? The diffusion sampling is based on an existing approach (Song et al. 2023), and it seems like the active sampling approach is based on existing uncertainty sampling. Thus, it is difficult to see where the novelty/contribution of the paper lies. It would be helpful if you could explicitly stated the contributions in a set of bullet points in the introduction. \n- The structure of the experimental section is confusing, particularly section 4.2. There is not any context as to what the methods (SWAG, Bootstrap, etc). are used for. Before introducing them, it would be helpful to identify where they are utilized in the framework. It was not clear to me until the results section that they would be substituted in for the diffusion sampling. Also, \"Comparison Methods\" would be a better suited title for the subsection.\n- In a similarly light, the paragraph from lines 468-473 lacks context. It is unclear which Table/Figure the analysis is discussing.\n- I'm not fully convinced about the practical advantage of the active sampling with the diffusion approach. As stated in the conclusion, diffusion models are inherently computationally heavy and slow. Thus, while you may need fewer measurements overall, the collection of each measurement would take much longer. For example, if it takes x times as long to choose the next angle than it does to just sample the next uniform angle, then you would want to show that your method allows you to collect at least x times fewer samples.\n- In Line 300-301, it would be useful to use a different variable rather than t in order to avoid confusion with the diffusion time steps."
