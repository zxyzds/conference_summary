    "abstract": "Controlled fusion energy is deemed pivotal for the advancement of human civilization. In this study, we introduce $\\textbf{LPI-LLM}$, a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing paradigms tailored to address a critical challenge, Laser-Plasma Instabilities ($\\texttt{LPI}$), in Inertial Confinement Fusion ($\\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we propose the $\\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a $\\textit{Fusion-specific Prompt}$, enabling accurate forecasting of $\\texttt{LPI}$-generated-hot electron dynamics during implosion. Secondly, we develop $\\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to temporally and spatially describe the driver laser intensity across time, capturing the unique characteristics of $\\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the $\\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting, providing valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\\texttt{ICF}$ process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11 $\\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\\texttt{HXR}$) energies emitted by the hot electrons in $\\texttt{ICF}$ implosions, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against concurrent best systems.  Additionally, we present $\\textbf{LPI4AI}$, the first $\\texttt{LPI}$ benchmark based on physical experiments, aimed at fostering novel ideas in $\\texttt{LPI}$ research and enhancing the utility of LLMs in scientific exploration. Overall, our work strives to forge an innovative synergy between AI and $\\texttt{ICF}$ for advancing fusion energy.",

This would provide a meaningful performance benchmark from within the field.\n- The confidence scanner\u2019s accuracy is only demonstrated through select examples. However, there is no quantifiable metric provided. Could the authors perform any expected calibration test on these results? This is particularly valuable in light of the fact that the confidence scanner is not shown to produce a meaningful likelihood analytically."

                "value": "The paper fails to establish in depth how the usage of LLMs can create enough richness of methodology to solve a complex problem to its finer details. Based on my experience of LLM usage for problems of comparable complexity, the limited disclosure of prompts is far from convincing. For an LLM to function effectively as an agent for solving complex problems that involve quantitative analysis, it needs an agentic design that integrates sophisticated prompt engineering and structured reasoning methodologies, such as chain-of-thought prompting. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting allows an LLM to break down intricate problems into a series of intermediate reasoning steps, mimicking how a human might approach and solve a multi-layered analytical task. This stepwise decomposition helps the model to systematically tackle each part of the problem, enabling clearer and more accurate reasoning. Prompts could be engineered to guide the LLM in sequentially explaining its calculations, assumptions, and decision-making processes. Without implementing such structured approaches, the application of an LLM to complex, analysis-driven problems remains superficial, as the model may produce outputs that hallucinate and lack precision or logical coherence.\n\nThis paper has limited meaningful algorithmic contributions and suffers from a method insufficiency or its articulation to address the core problem. This reduces the impact of this paper. This can be better presented by evaluating the system against a wide range of time-series problems with the required details. \n\nOne major concern with Figure 5 is the surprisingly poor performance of baseline models like the vanilla LSTM and Autoformer, which raises questions about whether these models were adequately optimized. Given the proven effectiveness of transformer-based models and LSTMs in similar predictive tasks, their lackluster results suggest potential shortcomings in hyperparameter tuning and model refinement. Without clear details on the training procedures or any effort to optimize these baselines, the comparison appears unconvincing, undermining the reliability of the reported findings.\n\nAdditionally, the paper lacks a critical discussion contrasting these models' inherent strengths and weaknesses relative to the proposed method. Providing such insights is essential for readers to assess whether the reported performance differences are due to fundamental advantages of the proposed approach or simply insufficient effort in tuning the baseline models. This omission suggests that the experimental setup may have been incomplete or lacked rigor. To address this, the authors should ensure proper hyperparameter optimization of baseline models, clearly document the tuning process, and include a robust analysis explaining the performance differences. Such enhancements would lend greater credibility to the results and offer readers a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's advantages.\n\nIt will also be good to explain how the fixed reservoir dynamics in reservoir computing, along with its sensitivity to hyperparameters and limited scalability, impact the model\u2019s adaptability and performance compared to more flexible and fully trainable architectures like transformers and LSTMs, particularly in complex or evolving data environments. The author can then reflect on how reservoir computing could be more impactful for this specific problem despite these shortcomings. Given its lack of adoption, unlike other well-established methods, it is crucial to expand on the topic in detail and establish how this can solve the problem better."

The paper begins with a comprehensive introduction to ICF, providing essential context for understanding the motivation behind this research. The authors leverage the LLM as a repository for general knowledge, employing a combination of scientific (fusion-specific) prompts along with temporal and spatial signals from a signal digestion block as inputs to the LLM. They train a prediction head on top of the LLM to derive the hot-electron energy profile. Additionally, a confidence estimator for the energy profile is developed, which considers both the last layer token embeddings and saliency to enhance trustworthiness. Notably, the authors present a benchmark dataset, LPI4AI, which could be instrumental for the next generation of AI-based ICF research. Extensive validation and ablation studies are conducted across different models to demonstrate their efficacy."
