    "title": "Effective and Efficient Time-Varying Counterfactual Prediction with State-Space Models",
    "abstract": "Time-varying counterfactual prediction (TCP) from observational data supports the answer of when and how to assign multiple sequential treatments, yielding importance in various applications. Despite the progress achieved by recent advances, e.g., LSTM or Transformer based causal approaches, their capability of capturing interactions in long sequences remains to be improved in both prediction performance and running efficiency. In parallel with the development of TCP, the success of the state-space models (SSMs) has achieved remarkable progress toward long-sequence modeling with saved running time. Consequently, studying how Mamba simultaneously benefits the effectiveness and efficiency of TCP  becomes a compelling research direction. In this paper, we propose to exploit advantages of the SSMs to tackle the TCP task, by introducing a counterfactual Mamba model with Covariate-based Decorrelation towards Selective Parameters (Mamba-CDSP). Motivated by the over-balancing problem in TCP of the direct covariate balancing methods, we propose to de-correlate between the current treatment and the representation of historical covariates, treatments, and outcomes, which can mitigate the confounding bias while preserve more covariate information. In addition, we show that the overall de-correlation in TCP is equivalent to regularizing the selective parameters of Mamba over each time step, which leads our approach to be effective and lightweight. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Mamba-CDSP not only outperforms baselines by a large margin, but also exhibits prominent running efficiency.",

We encourage reviewers to be broad in their definitions of originality and significance. For example, originality may arise from a new definition or problem formulation, creative combinations of existing ideas, application to a new domain, or removing limitations from prior results. You can incorporate Markdown and Latex into your review. See https://openreview.net/faq.\n\nOriginality\nThe paper proposes a novel approach to capturing hidden heterogeneity in time series based counterfactual prediction, which is a significant domain problem in causal learning. The proposed Time-shared Heterogeneity Learning from Time Series method is a novel method that addresses this specific challenge by encoding the shared time-aware latent confounder and then utilizing them for counterfactual outcome forecasting.\n\nQuality\nThe paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the proposed method, including a detailed explanation of the shared latent confounder variable encoding process via VAE and how to adapt to time series data.\nThe experimental results basically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of mainstream models. \n\nClarity\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of technical concepts and methods. The authors provide an informative context in each section that effectively organizes the story and summarizes the paper contributions.\n\nSignificance\nThe proposed THLTS method has the potential to improve the accuracy of counterfactual outcome in time-series data scenarios. The capture of hidden heterogeneity across time domains is a common challenge in many fields. The proposed method is flexible and can be easily inserted with arbitrary causal modeling framework, making it a valuable contribution to the field."

While performance improvements are shown, deeper analysis of where/why the improvements come from would strengthen the paper. For instance, Table 2 shows substantial gains from CDSP on the MIMIC-III real-world dataset, but this is puzzling since we cannot observe counterfactuals in this data and thus confounding bias should have minimal impact on evaluation. The authors should explain why CDSP shows such dramatic improvements if the test metrics don't actually measure counterfactual prediction ability. This suggests the gains might come from other aspects of the method beyond bias correction, which deserves further investigation.\n\n3.
