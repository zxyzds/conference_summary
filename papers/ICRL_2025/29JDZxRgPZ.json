    "title": "EM-GANSim: Real-time and Accurate EM Simulation Using Conditional GANs for 3D Indoor Scenes",
    "abstract": "We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach  (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps.  Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.",

Authors propose a method based on using cGAN and regularized by physical constrains to generate plausible propagation heatmaps given the structure of the scene. They show through experiments that although the performance is not on-par with Ray Tracing methods, this method allows for a faster simulation."

                "value": "Main:\n- The proposal to use random input to a GAN to avoid mode collapse is not very well-justified. The proposed set-up is very similar to the common conditional GANs which can easily have mode collapse. Further when adding regularizations, such as the physical regularizations proposed, the risk for mode collapse is increased. The authors mention building the model from simpler problem up to the aimed taks and this helps with fine-tuning and perhaps mode collapse. It would be great to have more experiments/analysis on  what is the breaking point and why the model is stable in its final version.\n\nMinor:\n- What representation is used for the conditional geometry? A more thorough description of the modality in line 162 would be helpful. It is unclear how the 3D model is encoded and given to a GAN.\n- Figure 2 should be labled with yours vs baseline so its easier to read. The interpretation in the caption as what is the weakness vs strength of your method is not easily understandable from the heatmaps and would be great to highlight them visually."

                "value": "This paper presents EM-GANSim, a learning-based approach for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation simulation in indoor environments. The core technical contribution is a modified conditional GAN architecture that incorporates both geometric information and transmitter location to predict power distribution heatmaps while adhering to electromagnetic propagation principles. The authors propose a physically-inspired learning framework that integrates direct propagation, reflection, and diffraction effects through specialized loss terms in the GAN's objective function.\n\nThe method claims to achieve comparable accuracy to traditional ray tracing-based simulators while offering significant speed improvements (reported as 5X faster). The authors evaluate their approach on 15 indoor scenes and provide ablation studies examining the impact of noise and physical constraints. They also introduce a dataset comprising over 2,000 indoor scene models with corresponding EM simulation heatmaps.\n\nWhile I am not an expert in electromagnetic propagation simulation and wireless communications, the paper appears to address an important practical challenge in real-time EM simulation. However, there is some ambiguity in how the method handles true 3D environments versus 2D representations, and the room generation and data preparation processes could benefit from clearer documentation. The paper presents an interesting application of deep learning to physics-based simulation, though both its theoretical foundations and physical accuracy need closer examination."

There's no clear explanation of how height information is processed in the network, no visualization of vertical propagation effects, and no analysis of height-dependent signal variations. Table 2 only specifies area (square meter) without height information. The paper needs to either demonstrate true 3D capability or clarify that it's a 2.5D approach.\n- Critical details about the \"2K+ models and 64M heatmaps\" are missing. The paper doesn't explain how these indoor scenes were generated, validated, or processed. Without this information, readers cannot assess data quality or reproduce the results.\n- The method description lacks important specifics. The GAN architecture details, training process, and hyperparameter selection are not fully described. The physics-based loss weights lack justification, and there's minimal discussion of training stability.\n- The experimental validation relies mainly on MSE comparisons. The performance measurements lack important context - hardware specifications, memory requirements, and preprocessing costs are not reported. The gap between training (3 dbm\u00b2) and testing (8.5 dbm\u00b2) MSE also needs explanation."

                "value": "1. The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. It only presents scores in comparison to DCEM, and the detailed quantitative results are relegated to supplementary materials rather than the main manuscript. I've calculated the detailed score: GAN-based (dBm\u00b2): 8.69; DCEM (dBm\u00b2): 7.89.\nThis suggests that the GAN-based method performs slightly worse than the DCEM method introduced at VTC 2022. Given the recent methods proposed in the literature (Vaganova et al., 2023; Wang & Manocha, 2023; Haron et al., 2021; G\u00f3mez et al., 2023), incorporating more experimental results could lead to a fairer and more comprehensive evaluation.\n2. Though the proposed method is faster than traditional RT-based methods, it still takes 3-4 seconds to simulate one room. This is far from what the author frequently claimed to contribute to the 'real-time data analysis.' If the real-time is for per data point, then the traditional RT-based methods are real-time, too.\n3. The introduction could be strengthened by including a more detailed rationale for using cGAN in this context, specifically on how its features address the problem. Although section 5 provides some of this analysis, highlighting it earlier would improve the logical flow.\n4. The qualitative comparison is not sufficient, and the conclusion \"We see with GAN-based methods that the heatmaps show less MSE in general captures and exhibit more pronounced areas of both high and low signal strength, suggesting a finer granularity in the simulation of received powers.\" is ambiguous. How can the simulation judge by \"more pronounced areas of both high and low signal strength\"? Besides, the mean mse is higher!\n\nMinor:\n1. The plots and tables are not well designed, which makes them hard to understand. e.g. Figure 1 fails to demonstrate the overall method clearly. There is space to improve with regard to color design (Figure 3) and table format. In Figure 2, labels should be inserted into the plot instead of writing the first row: xxx, second row: xxx...in the caption.\n2. There are too many {enumerate} and {itemize}, which is not so common in papers. It would take a lot of space and make the paper look loose. \n3. Minor inconsistencies in grammar and terminology, such as a misplaced comma and inconsistent use of terms like \"ray tracing\" versus \"ray-tracing,\" which should be standardized.\n4. Table 3 is hard to understand. Why \"Generation time per data point (seconds)\" is a column?"
