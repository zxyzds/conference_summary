    "title": "Mixture-of-Queries Transformer: Camouflaged Instance Segmentation via Queries Cooperation and Frequency Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Due to the high similarity between camouflaged instances and the surroundings and the widespread camouflage-like scenarios, the recently proposed camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) is a challenging and relevant task. Previous approaches achieve some progress on CIS, while many overlook camouflaged objects\u2019 color and contour nature and then decide on each candidate instinctively. In this paper, we contribute a Mixture-of-Queries Transformer (MoQT) in an end-toend manner for CIS which is based on two key designs (a Frequency Enhancement Feature Extractor and a Mixture-of-Queries Decoder). First, the Frequency Enhancement Feature Extractor is responsible for capturing the camouflaged clues in the frequency domain. To expose camouflaged instances, the extractor enhances the effectiveness of contour, eliminates the interference color, and obtains suitable features simultaneously. Second, a Mixture-of-Queries Decoder utilizes multiple experts of queries (several queries comprise an expert) for spotting camouflaged characteristics with cooperation. These experts collaborate to generate outputs, refined hierarchically to a fine-grained level for more accurate instance masks. Coupling these two components enables MoQT to use multiple experts to integrate effective clues of camouflaged objects in both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our MoQT outperforms 18 state-of-the-art CIS approaches by 2.69% on COD10K and 1.93% on NC4K in average precision.",

This idea is interesting and worth emulating.\n2. The ablation experiments are sufficient.\n3. The presentation of the paper is easy to understand, including some visual comparisons, etc."

But introduction of Fourier transform is similar to the previous work CamoFourier:\nUnveiling Camouflage: A Learnable Fourier-based Augmentation for Camouflaged Object Detection and Instance Segmentation, arXiV, 2023\n2. Compared with the vanilla query-based decoder, the MoQ decoder introduces a Mixture-of-Queries (MoQ) layer with initialized M experts. Then, the M+1 outputs of the MoQ layer are aggregated via an adaptive weight. The novelty of MoQ is limited. The improvement of the query mechanism is a novel approach, but the proposed MoQ is only a token aggregation method. Besides, each layer of the MoQ decoder introduces initialized experts, which should hurt cross-attention enhanced query tokens. That sounds unreasonable.\n3. The structure of Fig. 4 is not consistent with Eq. (4). The aggregated query tokens of multiple experts are input the vanilla query-based decoder in Eq. (4). But, the Fig. 4 does not present this process. Actually, the layer of MoQ decoder is twice the one of vanilla query-based decoder."

I suggest that authors provide a more in-depth comparison with CamoFourier, highlighting any specific differences in how they utilize Fourier transforms and discussing how their approach advances beyond CamoFourier's techniques.\n3. Authors should add some CIS methods from 2024 for comprehensive evulation, such as GLNet. Authors are suggested to directly compare their results with GLNet\u2019s.\nCamouflaged Instance Segmentation From Global Capture to Local Refinement, IEEE Signal Processing Letter, 2024.\n4. The author should clearly articulate the number of query tokens used on each dataset and verify the impact of varied query token counts on different datasets.\n\nIn summary, the author should clearly elucidate the contributions of FEFE and MoQ to assess whether the paper meets the quality standards for acceptance at ICLR. For FEFE, simply using Fourier transform is not sufficient. For MoQ, aggregating multiple experis with query tokens and then inputing transformer decoder layers, this technology is not novel enough."

Insufficient Baseline Comparisons: While the paper includes comparisons with several CIS methods, it does not fully explore benchmarks with generic instance segmentation methods that could also apply to camouflaged segmentation. Including results for generic transformers or non-CIS-specific models with adaptations for camouflage (e.g., baseline Mask DINO [1] with FEFE added) would clarify the advantage of MoQT over generalized solutions.\n\n2. The originality of Frequency Enhancement Feature Extractor (FEFE): The paper asserts that frequency domain-based contour enhancement is effective for CIS, but frequency domain analysis for camouflage object detection has already proposed by previous works like [2][3]. Although these works are dedicated for COD, the methodology of locate the camouflage objects is similar to CIS task.\n\n3. Interpretability of the MoQ Decoder: Although the multi-expert query mechanism is innovative, the paper lacks insight into how each \u201cexpert\u201d in the MoQ Decoder contributes uniquely to segmentation refinement.
