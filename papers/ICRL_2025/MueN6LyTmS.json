    "abstract": "The co-evolution of morphology and behavior in 3D space has garnered considerable interest in the field of embodied intelligence. \nWhile recent studies have highlighted the considerable benefits of geometric symmetry for tasks like learning to locomote, navigate, and explore in dynamic 3D environments, its role within co-evolution setup remains unexplored.\nExisting benchmarks encounter several key issues: 1) the task lacks consideration for spatial geometric information; 2) the method lacks geometric symmetry to deal with the complexities in 3D environments.\nIn this work, we propose a novel setup, named Subequivariant Morphology-Behavior Co-Evolution in 3D Environments (3DS-MB), to address the identified limitations.\nTo be specific, we propose EquiEvo, which injects geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, to construct dynamic, learnable local reference frames, enabling the joint policy to generalize to diverse task spatial structures, thereby improving co-evolution efficiency.\nThen, we evaluate EquiEvo on the proposed environments, where our method consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches in tasks such as locomotion navigation and adversarial scenarios.\nExtensive experiments underscore the importance of subequivariance for the co-evolution of morphology and behavior, effective morphology-task mapping and robust morphology-behavior mapping.",

This approach constructs a local orthonormal basis and projects sensing information with spatial properties such as velocity and position into this local basis to enhance the generalizability of the policy module over diverse transformations, particularly those that result from translations, rotations or reflections of the morphology or task."

Supporting a diverse set of morphologies with a more efficient controller would reduce the time needed for designing morphology-specific network architectures.

                "value": "Lack of novelty\n\nThe primary contribution of this work is a substitution of the reinforcement learning policy module from the Transform2Act approach with an equivariant GNN. Compared to the work cited by authors (Chen et al., 2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18951) (Chen et al., 2024 https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12505), this submission appears to be a repackaging of an existing subequivariant reinforcement learning idea with a different problem setup. This submission reuses the same local reference frame (LRF) transformation as in https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12505 with the same proof process in their appendix. As far as I can tell, the only appreciable difference is the addition of a relatively simple translation to the Og(3) setup in https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12505 forming Eg(3). A more compelling contribution would include a demonstration of significant differences in results. While the authors claimed their setup can inject symmetry into generated morphological designs, their claim is not well supported.\n\nLack of evidence of generalizability\n\nAlthough the symmetry enhancement is the core claim, improved symmetry was only explored within a single basic agent skeleton -- the ant morphology. There was no metric or quantitative analysis to test the consistency of symmetry improvement across varied morphologies, or how the improvement of implementing LRF transformation in the policy module affects the optimization algorithm. \nWithout visualizations of generated morphologies from additional environments, and without a symmetry-based metric to measure the improvement across different setups, it is difficult to assess the claims of the submission.\n\nLack of experiment design and analysis\n\nFollowing up on the above point, the only metric that was considered was reward. In two of the three explored benchmark environments (the humanoid and sumo) the morphology transformation was omitted and only attribute transformations were possible. In this reduced setting, it was unclear how morphology metrics changed over time (e.g. the limb lengths on both sides of the agent) should be readily available but was not extracted and analyzed. However the submission claims \u201cintegrating morphology evolution with sub-equivariance yielded a synergistic effect\u201d (Sect. 4.3) which is not supported by the experiments and could simply be the policy network producing better control under LRF transformation that are independent of morphology.\n\nLack of clarity\n\nThe mathematical notation was inconsistent and rather confusing. For example, symbols like \u201cm\u201d are overloaded with different meanings across subscripts (equation 3), superscripts (equation 3), and variables (equation 9, 10, 11) without further clarification of meaning in a verbal format, which undermines the clarity of the theoretical framework. In addition to restructuring the mathematical framework and standardizing notion, explaining the symbols used in equations with natural language, a few words even, would improve clarity immensely -- a symbol table would be ideal."

Can you analyze the features of the group of evolved morphologies at each point of the timeline using multiple trials, and explain how your policy module affects evolution?\n\n3.

                "value": "The exposition of the motivations, the methods and the results should be improved. I provide some examples. In the summary of the contributions. 3DS-MB is defines as a \"benchmark\", in the rest of the paper as a \"method\". I could not find where the authors define which symmetries the network and the morphology are invariant to. From the figures it seems that the ant evolves in a radially-symmetric way (figure 2), but then in figure 10 it seems to be laterally symmetric.\n\nI find the premise of the paper surprising, as the second sentence of the abstract is \"While recent studies have highlighted the considerable benefits of geometric symmetry for tasks like learning to locomote, navigate and explore in dynamic 3D environments, its role within co-evolution setup remains unexplored\". Then the paper cites, in the first sentence of the introduction, Gupta et al. [1] and Dong et al. [2], which both describe an evolutionary experiment simultaneously improving the agent's policy and morphology *imposing bilateral symmetry of the agent* (cf. Unimal designed described in the paper). Maybe the authors mean that the studying the role of symmetry was not the focus of the paper, but their wording suggests something else. I recommend to clarify how the author's approach to symmetry in co-evolution differs from or extends beyond the bilateral symmetry used in the cited papers, and if the symmetry they impose is only in the state representation or also in the morphology transformations.\n\nIt is unclear when reading the paper which components of the design are novel and which have been taken from previous work. For example, in the section \"Morphology transform\", no previous paper is mentioned, but several papers cited in the introduction define similar or identical transformations. Instead, the authors write \"We divide the morphology transform stage into two sub-stages\", implying that is an idea of this paper. In general, it is very difficult to evaluate this paper because the design choices are not introduced in view of the related works. Similarly, how does the subequivariant graph neural network described in this paper differ from the ones used in [3] and [4]?\n\nWhen I first read the paper, I misunderstood a central aspect of the paper. In the introduction, the authors write \"An essential aspect of our approach is ensuring that the evolution of the morphology remains invariant to geometric transformations\". At this point, one would expect the morphology transformations to be constrained by some kind of symmetry. Figure 1 and 2 also reinforce this misunderstanding: the morphology on the right (with subequivariance) looks symmetric (radially and laterally), while the one on the left is asymmetric. Instead, it seems to be that, while the representation is symmetric due to the subequivariance of the graph, the morphology transformations are not (figure 10). The authors should make these aspects clearer.\n\nThe experimental results do not compare the methods with previously introduced algorithms, they are rather ablation studies. They remove subequivariance, morphology transformations or both. However, the authors mention several previous works about morphology-policy co-evolution. As the initial motivation of the paper is that these methods underperform in 3D environments, they should prove this with experiments.\n\nOverall, while the results are promising, unfortunately I think the paper is not ready for publication in its current state.\n\n\n[1] Agrim Gupta, Silvio Savarese, Surya Ganguli, and Li Fei-Fei.

                "value": "* When the authors speak about \"Morphology Value\", do they mean a value function mapping the morphology to the expected cumulative reward? I agree that this should not depend on transformations of the environment such as rotations or translations, but a value of the morphology should not depend on the environment state in the first place. Or do the authors want to learn a value function for a specific morphology when the agent is in a given state? This part needs to be better explained.\n\n* Is the \"Local Reference Frame Canonicalization\" a novelty of this work? No reference is given in that section, as well as no explanation as to why this canonicalization is performed.\n\n* In the humanoid, why are only the attributes of the body's segments modified, and not the morphology? I believe the morphology changes would not work with the humanoid and I believe the authors performed this experiment, but omitted it from the paper.\n\n* Can you explain the learning curves of Sumo? Why do they decrease at a certain point?

Specifically, a local reference frame (LRF) is first predicted from original observations via subequivariant message passing mechanisms, and then the observations are projected into this LRF coordinate so that they become invariant. The authors validate the indispensability of subequivariance modeling for morphology-behavior co-evolution in complex 3D environments.
