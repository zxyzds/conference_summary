    "title": "Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation",
    "abstract": "Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, \ngenerating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others,\nremains a largely unexplored domain. \nThis gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series.\nIn this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. \nUsing extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach  outperforms previous work by a large margin. \nOur code will be made public after this article is accepted.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a system based on Diffusion Transformer to generate tabular data series. Particularly the difficulties of handling heterogeneity and variable length of tabular data are tackled. The paper makes a couple of proposals such as 1) transformer denoising combined with latent encoding of VAE, 2) Autoregressive VAE decoder, 3) several data encoding techniques. Experimental results are presented with multiple datasets using proper metrics for the tasks."

This comprehensive framework ensures that the generated data preserves the intricate relationships within each row and adapts to varying sequence lengths, which are critical for accurate and realistic data generation.\n\nThe authors propose a new metric specifically tailored for the evaluation of tabular data time series generation. This metric provides a standardized and objective means to assess the quality and performance of generated data, facilitating more reliable comparisons across different methods. By introducing this metric, the paper sets a benchmark for future research in this domain, promoting the development of more robust and effective data generation techniques.\n\nThe proposed method is rigorously evaluated using a diverse set of public datasets, demonstrating its versatility and robustness across various types of tabular data. This extensive experimental validation highlights the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches, showcasing its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

                "value": "While the paper introduces numerous model modifications aimed at addressing the challenges of tabular data time series generation, it lacks ablation experiments to isolate and evaluate the impact of each modification. Ablation studies are crucial for understanding the contribution of individual components to the overall performance of the model. Without these experiments, it is difficult to determine which modifications are most effective and how they interact to improve the model's capabilities.\n\nThe paper does not include any case studies that showcase the generated tabular data time series. Given that the primary focus of the research is on generating realistic and useful time series data, it is surprising that the paper does not provide examples to illustrate the differences between the outputs of various models. Including case studies would provide valuable insights into the practical implications of the proposed method and allow readers to visually assess the quality and realism of the generated data.\n\nThe paper does not present experiments that demonstrate the practical utility of the generated time series tabular data. It is important to show how the generated data can be used in real-world applications, such as improving predictive modeling, anomaly detection, or decision-making processes. Without such experiments, it is challenging to gauge the practical relevance and impact of the proposed method. Demonstrating the usefulness of the generated data in specific applications would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions and highlight its value to practitioners."
