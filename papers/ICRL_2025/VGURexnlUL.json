    "title": "Accelerating 3D Molecule Generation via Jointly Geometric Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new 3D molecule generation framework, called GOAT, for fast and effective 3D molecule generation based on the flow-matching optimal transport objective. Specifically, we formulate a geometric transport formula for measuring the cost of mapping multi-modal features (e.g., continuous atom coordinates and categorical atom types) between a base distribution and a target data distribution. Our formula is solved within a joint, equivariant, and smooth representation space. This is achieved by transforming the multi-modal features into a continuous latent space with equivariant networks. In addition, we find that identifying optimal distributional coupling is necessary for fast and effective transport between any two distributions. We further propose a flow refinement and purification mechanism for optimal coupling identification. By doing so, GOAT can turn arbitrary distribution couplings into new deterministic couplings, leading to a joint optimal transport path for fast 3D molecule generation. The purification filters out the subpar molecules to ensure the ultimate generation quality. We theoretically and empirically prove that the proposed flow refinement and purification yield transport plan with non-increasing cost. Finally, extensive experiments show that GOAT enjoys the efficiency of solving geometric optimal transport, leading to a double speedup compared to the sub-optimal method while achieving the best generation quality regarding validity, uniqueness, and novelty.",

In equation (5), we still have the same \\pi for both coordinates and features right? The reasoning for this part is missing.\n2. I am not sure the distribution coupling, $\\Gamma$ is a correct terminology used in this paper. The distribution coupling should be referring to pairing points between two distributions, rather than pairing within one pair of data sample by permutation, rotation and translation. \n3. Maybe limited novelty: In EquiFM[1], we know the idea of equivariant optimal transport (EOT) is proposed, which has a large overlapping with the core contributions of this paper. Can this paper\u2019s main contributions be concluded as  EOT + Equivariant Autoencoder? If so, the novelty of paper may be limited.\n4. Is Geometric Probability Distribution a formal terminology in molecule generation community? I do not see it is widely adopted in other related work and it can be misunderstood with geometric distribution. \n5. The abbreviation EAE in line 251 pops out without specification (I am assuming it is referring to Equivaraint Autoencoder?)\n\n[1] Song, Yuxuan, et al. \"Equivariant flow matching with hybrid probability transport for 3d molecule generation.\" Advances in Neural Information"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Comparison with Recent Edge-Modeling Methods and Potential Integration of Edge Features:**\n\nSome recent models, such as JODO and EQGAT-Diff, have achieved better performance by explicitly modeling edges in molecular graphs. Including comparisons with these models would strengthen your paper. Moreover, adding edge features to your joint optimal transport framework seems feasible and could unlock the full potential of your method. Additionally, a more recent model called Semla Flow (a preprint published in June 2024) demonstrates superior accuracy and speed. Comparing your approach with these methods would greatly enhance the value of the proposed latent optimal transport (OT) technique.\n\n2. **Concerns About Atom Stability Metric and 3D Evaluation:**\n\nWhile the task is 3D molecule generation, there is no real evaluation of 3D coordinates for unconditional molecule generation in your paper. The term \"atom stability\" is mentioned without a clear definition. Given that you report an 86.5% figure for the GEOM Drugs dataset, I assume this refers to 3D atom stability. This metric is based on comparing bond lengths with tabulated values, allowing a tolerance of about 0.5\u202f\u00c5. The issue is that only 2.8% of GEOM Drugs molecules fully comply with these criteria, making the metric potentially misleading. I strongly encourage avoiding the propagation of this metric in new papers. The optimal distances between atoms are primarily defined by the potential energy landscape underlying the data\u2014for GEOM Drugs, it's GFN2-xTB\u2014and depending on atom configurations, deviations in bond lengths can exceed 10%.\n\n3. **Difficulty in Claiming State-of-the-Art Performance:**\n\nRelated to the first point, it is difficult to claim that this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance because it has not been compared with some other relevant methods mentioned above, including MiDi. Including such comparisons would strengthen the claim of achieving SOTA performance."

                "value": "1. Could you provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the generated 3D molecular structures?\nI acknowledge that determining the most effective 3D metric is an open and important question. There are several possible solutions you might consider:\n- The approach uses the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles. Some papers, like MiDi, have implemented this method. However, be cautious, as a single poorly predicted molecule can significantly skew the metric due to the way MiDi implemented it.\n- SemlaFlow, for example, proposes using the optimization energy drop with the MMFF94 force field as a measure. Given that your ground truth data is based on GFN-xTB calculations, it might be more appropriate to assess the energy drop using GFN-xTB, as it aligns with the potential energy landscape of your dataset.\n- Models like JODO and others have utilized MMD for bond angles, bond lengths, and torsion distributions, focusing only on the most frequent bonds and angles. While none of these metrics are perfect, they are generally more informative and insightful than relying solely on 3D atom stability.\n\nThe important part here is to ensure that when comparing models, you use exactly the same implementation of these metrics to obtain a reliable comparison. By incorporating these additional evaluations, you can provide a more thorough and insightful assessment of the geometric accuracy of your generated molecular structures. If I am adding one of these, I would rather do it on GEOM-Drugs dataset because it is much more realistic, for QM9 it is quite fast to compute GFN-xTB geometry optimization, and a lot of these molecules do not have considerable variability of 3D structure. \n\n2. Could you perform comparisons with recent models like EQGAT-Diff, JODO, or SemlaFlow? I'm especially interested in a comparison with SemlaFlow because both papers place significant emphasis on improving the performance of molecule generation and utilize the flow matching objective. The main difference is that your approach performs flow matching in latent space, while SemlaFlow conducts diffusion explicitly on bonds, atoms, and coordinates.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could compare your method with SemlaFlow in terms of:\n- Topological Metrics: Such as 2D molecule stability, validity, or introduced significance.\n- 3D Metrics: Possibly using some of the metrics described in previous comments (e.g., bond angles, torsion distributions).\n- Performance Metrics: Considering that both models generate molecules of similar size, metrics like the average time to generate a molecule would be insightful.\n\nAdditionally, could you discuss the advantages of your method over the version of flow matching used in SemlaFlow? Providing a brief discussion of the key algorithmic differences between your proposed method and SemlaFlow's flow matching approach\u2014focusing on how these differences might impact performance or computational efficiency\u2014would enhance the understanding of your contributions."
