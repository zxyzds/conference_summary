    "title": "Learning Fused State Representations for Control from Multi-View Observations",
    "abstract": "In visual control tasks, leveraging observations from multiple views enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to perceive the environment more effectively. However, while multi-view observations enrich decision-making information, they also increase the dimension of observation space and introduce more redundant information. Thus, how to learn compact and task-relevant representations from multi-view observations for downstream RL tasks remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), which integrates a self-attention mechanism with bisimulation metric learning to fuse task-relevant representations from multi-view observations. To foster more compact fused representations, we also incorporate a mask-based latent reconstruction auxiliary task to learn cross-view information. Additionly, this mechanism of mask and reconstruction can enpower the model with the ability to handle missing views by learning an additional mask tokens. We conducted extensive experiments on the Meta-World and Pybullet benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other multi-view RL algorithms and effectively aggregates task-relevant details from multi-view observations, coordinating attention across different views.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a method that combines a bisimulation-based approach with masked representation learning for multi-view reinforcement learning. The core idea is that to enable task-relevant multi-view fusion, it is essential to align the integration process closely with the specific objectives of the task. In other words, when fusing information from multiple views, the task\u2019s specific goals (Equation 8) must be considered. The authors have evaluated their method on two visual control environments, including Meta-World and PyBullet, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods."

Although the authors present two core challenges of multi-view RL in the introduction, these challenges have already been extensively explored in prior research. While incorporating bisimulation metrics into state aggregation is reasonable, bisimulation-based methods are also well-covered in existing RL literature, making this combination feel more like a natural choice than a groundbreaking innovation.\n- Although the authors conducted extensive experiments and validated the effectiveness of their approach against various existing multi-view RL methods, there are still two main gaps. First, there is no experimental verification of whether the method remains superior to baseline models in cases with missing views (even with a single view). Second, Seo et al. (2023) proposed the masked world model, which performs well on multi-view RL tasks and has methodological similarities to the approach in this paper. A direct comparison with Seo et al.'s work would provide stronger support for the effectiveness of this method."

                "value": "1. The author incorporates bisimulation principles by integrating reward signals and dynamic differences into the fused state representation to capture task-relevant details. As I am aware, [1] also acquires representations for control with bisimulation metrics. Additionally, the author employed a Mask-based Latent Reconstruction strategy, which is analogous to that in [2]. Does this similarity suggest a deficiency in significant innovation or does the author offer additional components or enhancements that differentiate it from the existing strategies in [1] and [2]? Furthermore, it is essential to determine whether appropriate credit and comparison with the prior works in [1] and [2] have been adequately accounted for.\n\n[1] Learning invariant representations for reinforcement learning without reconstruction.\n\n[2] Mask-based Latent Reconstruction for reinforcement learning\u3002\n\n3.

Whether this method is only useful for robot control tasks needs to be further verified on more types of environments, such as Carla, atari, etc.\n\n5.  The paper lacks sufficient ablation experiments. The author only ablated MFSC without bisimulation constraints ('MFSC w/o bis') and MFSC without Mask and Latent Reconstruction ('MFSC w/o res'), but not more detailed parts like the Self-Attention Fusion Module.\n\n6. The author claims that MFSC can be seamlessly integrated into any existing downstream reinforcement learning framework to enhance the agent's understanding of the environment. However, there are no relevant experiments to verify this claim."
