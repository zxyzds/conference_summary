    "abstract": "Transporting between arbitrary distributions is a fundamental goal in generative modeling.\nRecently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to obtain in practice.\nFurthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching (DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space.\nOur approach extends Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its convergence to the SB.\nFurthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph transformation, and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost function described by the graph edit distance.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field of chemistry.\nExperimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes molecules' property-of-interest with minimal graph transformation, successfully retaining other features.\nCode is available [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DDSBM-1353).",

We will revise the manuscript to clearly highlight our strengths. As soon as the revisions are complete, we will reply with an official comment.\n\nW2: We understand the importance of providing additional experimental evidence as proposing a discrete model for DSBM. To address this, we plan to extend our experiments on additional datasets proposed in SPECTRE [1] for graph generation task.

Additionally, we will conduct graph generation on larger synthetic graph dataset (**Planar**), to further validate our approach. We will also include the generation trajectories for our previously conducted experiments to provide deeper insights. Specifically, we will compare DBM and DDSBM with DiGress in terms of degree, cluster and orbit for all datasets, while additionally evaluating VUN (valid, unique & novel graphs) for the planar dataset. We will share experimental results as they become available. Please let us know if there are any additional results or analyses that the reviewer would find helpful for a more comprehensive evaluation of DDSBM.\n\nW3: We will conduct experiments to compare the effects of graph matching algorithms displayed in Appendix table 4.\n\nWe will provide an official comment once these revisions are finalized.

                "value": "Thank you for your thoughtful review and suggestions on related works. Here, we would like to briefly explain the primary task of this work. Our focus lies in transformations between graphs, specifically including molecular graphs. Rather than addressing the transportation between distributions defined over topological spaces of graphs, we tackle the problem of transporting the source graph to the target graph through structural edits (graph transformations).\n\n**[Regarding Weakness 1 & Question 2]**\n\nAs you suggested, comparing flow matching models (FM) and diffusion bridge models (DBM) would indeed be an interesting study. In essence, FM and DBM approaches are similar in that they share the objective of training a transportation between two distributions.\n\nThe proposing method defines a reference process as a continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) in a discrete metric state space, then solves the associated \u201cSchr\u00f6dinger bridge problem\u201d (SBP). The SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem (EOT), making it closely related to optimal transport-flow matching (OT-FM). However, it is important to emphasize that, while both DBM and SBP aim to transport between distributions, SBP aims to find the optimal joint distribution (paired data distribution) in contrast to DBM, whose objective is to learn transportation map based on a given joint distribution. This distinction also parallels the difference between FM and OT-FM.\n\nDue to these differences, it would be challenging to conduct a controlled comparison between FM and our method, as several variables in the methodology\u2014such as deep learning model architecture, SDE vs. ODE formulations, sampling algorithms, and training of joint distributions\u2014would be difficult to control. Additionally, the two FM papers [1, 2] you suggested focus on transporting node feature distributions within a fixed graph structure rather than addressing the transformation of the graph structure itself. Reflecting image and text data inherently form sequences or grid structures, the suggested references do not alter these underlying structures. For these reasons, we believe the suggested references may not align closely with the main focus of our manuscript.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only work on OT-FM for graphs is [5], which is currently under peer review at ICLR 2025, and code for this work has not yet been released.\n\n**[Regarding Weakness 2 & Question 1]**\n\nAs the reviewer mentioned, our proposed DDSBM is not the first to address the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem in discrete states. Reference [3] addresses the SBP between two distributions based on empirical datasets realized from each distribution, and shows that as the number of observations grows, the solution converges to the SB between the true distributions. Since DDSBM is also framed as an SBP between empirical distributions, this work could indeed be a useful reference. However, our work focuses on the transport problem between graph structures (\u201d*discrete*-states\u201d) rather than the fact that the problem is addressed with sampled (\u201d*discretized*\u201d) distributions. Also, we propose a solution method for the SBP in discrete setting, called DDSBM, while the reference [3] does not. Due to these aspects, the reference [3] differs from the central objective of DDSBM.\n\nReference [4] defines the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem\u00a0*on*\u00a0graphs and provides a numerical solution, establishing SBP on a graph space where nodes have defined probabilities and edges have defined weights. Within the context of this reference, our work could be considered an SBP for graph transformations: each node represents a graph dataset, such as a molecular graph, and edge weights are defined through a reference stochastic process (CTMC). Unlike the reference [4], which cannot generate new data, our work aims to produce transformed data for novel cases through generative modeling, addressing the transportation of data distributions. Nevertheless, the reference [4] indeed provides a valuable perspective on defining and solving the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem in discrete spaces, and we will reference it in our manuscript."

Below, we outline our planned revisions and responses to each point raised.\n\nW1: We will incorporate the NSPDK metric as suggested.\n\nW2: We agree that presenting error bars would enhance the robustness of our results. To address this, we will conduct additional experiments and include error bars across different training runs.\n\nW3: We acknowledge that the current version may sound overly technical to the typical graph machine learning practitioner. In response, we will revise this section to improve clarity and accessibility, reflecting your suggestion. Once the revisions are complete, we will provide an official comment.\n\nQ1: We apologize for omitting a reference for the Hungarian algorithm. The Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [1], is a combinatorial optimization technique for solving the assignment problem. We used the Hungarian algorithm implemented in the Pygmtools package [2]. In the revised manuscript, we will add the references.\n\nQ2: We acknowledge that the baseline models show higher validity compared to our method. However, we observed that these models also demonstrate relatively low uniqueness, which suggests that their validity scores may be overestimated due to potential redundancy in generated structures. In this regard, we will conduct a thorough re-evaluation to verify these findings, and we will add a detailed discussion on this point in the revised manuscript.\n\nOnce these revisions are complete, we will provide an official comment. Thank you once again for your constructive comments.\n\nIf there are any additional requests, please feel free to let us know.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Kuhn, H. W. (1955).

Using the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) technique, DDSBM enables optimal graph modifications by minimizing structural changes, which is particularly valuable for molecular optimization tasks in drug and material discovery. In this context, the framework aligns with graph edit distance (GED), allowing efficient property-driven modifications while preserving the molecule's structure. Experiments show DDSBM achieves minimal structural shifts and successfully maintains desirable molecular properties, outperforming traditional graph translation methods."
