    "title": "Synergizing Motion and Appearance: Multi-Scale Compensatory Codebooks for Talking Head Video Generation",
    "abstract": "Talking head video generation aims to generate a realistic talking head video that\npreserves the person\u2019s identity from a source image and the motion from a driving\nvideo. Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a challenging\nand critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and fine-grained facial\ndetails simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often highly complex to model\nprecisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot provide sufficient appearance\nguidance during generation due to dynamic pose changes. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and appearance codebooks and perform\nmulti-scale codebook compensation to effectively refine both the facial motion\nconditions and appearance features for talking face image decoding. Specifically,\nthe designed multi-scale motion and appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to store representative global facial motion flow\nand appearance patterns. Then, we present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which utilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval\nstrategy to query complementary information from the two codebooks for joint\nmotion and appearance compensation. The entire process produces motion flows\nof greater flexibility and appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales, resulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework.\nExtensive experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our\napproach and demonstrate superior generation results from both qualitative and\nquantitative perspectives when compared to state-of-the-art competitors.",

For example, on the VoxCeleb1 dataset, for PSNR and AKD, the baseline (Table 2) is already almost as good as or even better than TPSM and MCNet (Table 1). Looks like this paper has a pretty strong baseline.\n\n(2) The experimental results can't really show that the codebook works well in both appearance and motion. From the visualized results, the method in this paper does well in clarity compared to existing ones. But from Table 2, it seems that MMC is more important for the improvement in PSNR and FID. The result of MAC isn't obvious. For motion, MMC can make some improvement, but it's not much better than other methods (like having a worse AKD than MRFA under same-identity reconstruction)."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "(1) Looking at Figure 9, both MAC and MCC have nice improvements at the frame level. But the author should give multi-frame results or video results. It is not certain how much difference there is in the overall generated video. That would better show the differences in effects and include more test cases, such as 1) gradual pose changes from frontal face to side face and 2) expression transitions from plain to extreme.\n\n(2) How much computational cost (FLOPs) and parameter size will be increased by the addition of MAC and MMC? Or in terms of running time, there should be some explanations here. More specifically, it can include the following contents: 1) computational costs for each component (MAC and MMC) separately, 2) as well as the overall increase compared to the baseline model; 3)The running time of different methods on the same device.\n\n\n(3) In the test examples, most of the motions are still the absolute motion of the head plus simple expression motions. For methods like follow-your-emoji and liveportrait, they have good performance in controlling subtle expressions[1-3]. How does the current method perform in this aspect? And what are the effect advantages compared with the comparison method? For example, the cases in links [4].\n\n\n\nIn general, I think the results obtained in this article are not bad. However, experimentally, it is not well supported that the codebook can improve motion and appearance at the same time. It seems that more often, the introduction of MMC will improve the final clarity to a certain extent.\n\n\n\n[1] https://liveportrait.github.io/src/video/image_animation_0_opt.mp4\n\n[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg9qpyupXbI#t=17\n\n[3] https://byteaigc.github.io/x-portrait/\n\n[4] https://kwaivgi-liveportrait.hf.space/file=/tmp/gradio/34db59a6dca64fde3f059ebeb888dd31a71e5592/d6_trim.mp4"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(1) The novelty of using multi-scale features. The usage of mutli-scale features are quite straightforward in many computer vision applications. Regarding talking head generation, previous works such as [1] has proposed to use multi-scale appearance features to form a tri-plane for talking head generation. Despite of different final representations (implicit field v.s. key-point based), the idea of introducing multi-scale features is similar and there seems no discussions in this paper.\n\n(2) The motivation of introducing codebooks for compensate motion and appearance is not clear enough. A straight forward method, at first glance, would be directly output residuals for compensation without using codebooks. One guess (from my POV) is that the learned codebooks constrained the operation space when performing compensations with input flow maps / appearance features, preventing arbitrary residuals which may destroy the output. However, this is purely my guess and there are no discussions of the motivations behind the usage of these codebooks. It would be helpful if the paper could explain why codebooks are preferable to directly outputting residuals, and what specific advantages the proposed method offers for talking head generation.\n\n(3) The result quality has not significantly outperform previous works. Per table 1, the proposed method does not outperform other baselines on CelebV-HQ dataset quantitatively. In figure 5, one could easily observe that the synthesized image has unconvincing identity preservation when performing cross-identity reenactments (e.g., in the first row and the second row the generated image has a wider face that similar to the driving person instead of the source; in the last row the generated image has a round chin while the source image has a pointed chin). Overall, these results raise my concerns that whether the current result is good enough to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Providing a more in-depth analysis of the method's performance particularly on the CelebV-HQ dataset where it failed to outperform other baselines would be helpful.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Li, Weichuang, et al. \"One-shot high-fidelity talking-head synthesis with deformable neural radiance field.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023."

In [1], the implicit warping approach was proposed to utilize multiple reference images, while this paper argues a multi-scale approach with one-shot reference. As the paper mentioned in the introduction, two key challenges are \"(1) Some motion patterns cannot be inferred from a single image pair, and (2) a still source image lacks sufficient appearance information to handle occlude regions or subtle expression changes\". Why does the proposed multi-scale approach could address these challenges with a single image input? Could you provide some more insights behind it?

The authors claim that the use of the proposed multi-scale refinement scheme at various granularities improves the visual quality of the generated videos. During inference, an initial motion flow estimate of the driving frame in reference to the source frame is refined progressively at various resolutions using features obtained by querying the motion codebook, which is used to warp the source facial features at each scale. These warped appearance features are further refined using the features obtained from the appearance codebook during the decoding process. The authors demonstrate superior results within the training distribution (VoxCeleb1) while yielding comparable results when evaluated on out-of-distribution samples (CelebV-HQ). \n\nNote: I will be using a numbered list in the following sections, for ease of reference during the discussion phase."

It is not clear how the proposed method overcomes this limitation. Is the codebook capable of hallucinating plausible facial features based on the query from the 'single source frame'? If so what prevents the model from generating unwarranted artifacts similar to the approaches that use generative models? \n\n3. Could the authors clarify with reference to what the residual computed when they state \"we predict the motion flow residual for each input\" in L244? If it is the motion residual between successive frames, explaining what prevents error propagation and any measure taken to enforce temporal coherence would help the readers understand the process better since this is a video generation pipeline. I believe discussing these aspects in the method section in a \"video\" generative pipeline is important. \n\n4. Is the pipeline robust to the initial keypoint-based coarse flow estimation? Is the choice of a keypoint based flow estimator random or a motivated? \n\n5.
