    "title": "GENRAD: Genomics and Radiomics Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Graph-Level Classification in Alzheimer's Disease",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) poses multifaceted challenges due to its neurodegenerative nature driven by complex genomic, radiomic, and structural interactions. Understanding these complex relationships is pivotal for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Current models struggle to effectively integrate multimodal data for AD, limiting their predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. Thus, there is a pressing need for models that can seamlessly fuse genomic and radiomic data to provide a holistic understanding of AD pathology. We introduce GENRAD, a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) that integrates multimodal genomic and radiomic data for graph-level classification in AD by representing patients, genes, and brain structures as distinct nodes and implementing advanced message-passing techniques. The benefits of GENRAD are fourfold: (1) It enables multimodal fusion of genomic and radiomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful insights missed by single-modality models. (2) Its adaptive multi-scale graph representations model interactions at various biological scales, capturing complex relationships essential for understanding AD pathology. (3) GENRAD incorporates explainable AI techniques, providing detailed analysis of key genomic markers and brain regions associated with AD. (4) GENRAD performs unsupervised clustering of genes, allowing the identification of functionally related biological pathways, thus empowering clinicians with actionable insights for personalized treatment strategies. GENRAD demonstrates superior classification accuracy in identifying AD-related patterns compared to existing machine and deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 91.70%.",

                "value": "1. Limited Technical Contribution. To handle the multi-modality data integrating genomic and radiomic information, this paper employs a message-passing technique originally proposed in [1] on a heterogeneous graph that models patients, genes, and brain structures with both local and global interactions. This existing approach constitutes the paper\u2019s major and only technical contribution, making the overall contribution marginal.\n\n[1] Hamilton, W., Ying, Z. and Leskovec, J., 2017. Inductive representation learning on large graphs. Advances in neural information processing systems, 30.\n\n2. Incomplete Literature Review. This paper lacks a comprehensive overview of existing multimodal data fusion methods, making it unclear how GENRAD specifically advances this field.

The rationale behind certain technical decisions\u2014such as using the SAGEConv layer for message-passing\u2014lacks detailed justification specific to the properties of the multimodal data. Furthermore, the reasons for employing the GeneMANIA method to obtain co-expression scores and for defining edges between brain structures based on 3D Euclidean distance remain unclear.\n\n4. Insufficient Evidence and Contextual Interpretation. On page 7, it is stated that GENRAD incorporates explainable AI techniques, such as GNNExplainer, alongside biological interpretability frameworks to make predictions that are not only accurate but also clinically meaningful. However, GNNExplainer is neither discussed in the methodology section nor tailored to the specific properties of multimodal data, which leaves the AI techniques used insufficiently explained. Additionally, while visualizations of gene interactions and brain regions affected by Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) are provided, they lack biological context and supporting evidence, raising questions about the relevance of the identified biomarkers and brain regions and their alignment with established neuroscience findings.\n\n5. Limited Dataset. The model evaluation uses a single dataset (ANMerge), limiting the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the dataset details, including size and data distribution, are not fully described.\n\n6. Comparative Analysis with Broader Baselines. To validate GENRAD\u2019s performance further, comparisons with a more comprehensive set of baselines, particularly from recent transformer-based approaches, would strengthen the findings.\n\n7. Marginal Performance Improvement. The classification results in Table 1 show that the proposed GENRAD achieves only a slight improvement over the follow-up methods and, in some cases, performs even worse.\n\n8. Unclear Presentation. Numerous abbreviations are used without providing their full terms, and Figure 2 lacks a caption, affecting overall clarity."

Given the single dataset used, how do the authors view GENRAD\u2019s applicability to other AD datasets, and are there plans for further validation with more diverse data sources?\n\n3. While explainable AI techniques are included, how do the authors envision clinicians using these insights in real-world applications? Providing case studies or examples could be beneficial."

For example, to demonstrate that GENRAD could outperform Zheng et al (2018) and Maddalena et al (2022), the baseline models should be retrained on the ANMerge. It is not fair to just put their results on ADNI in the table.\n\nIt is not clear how authors defined the edge between patient node and structure/gene node. And why there is no direct interaction between structure and gene node? This is important for AD for several reasons, like the amyloid and tau can be accumulated in different regions with different extents. Besides, the structure-structure edges were built based on 3D Euclidean distance between different regions. Is this better than other ways like covariance matrix from cortical thickness, or the correlation between node of brain regions, etc?\n\nWhy SAGEConv was chosen? There are many, many other message passing layers out there that are feasible, which should be compared with.\n\nNeither code nor data is provided, make it hard to evaluate the reproducibility.

Numerous established brain atlases, both anatomical [1] and functional [2], have been widely used in neuroscience and GNN research [3, 4] to construct brain networks. It is not explained why the authors opted for a segmentation model instead of utilizing these well-established atlases to generate structural data. Additionally, using 3D Euclidean distance to construct structure-structure edges seems questionable. Physical proximity between regions does not necessarily imply similar behavior or co-activation. The common practice in functional brain network construction typically involves using correlation metrics, not physical distance, to define edges.\n\n2. **Limited Literature Discussion**: The paper lacks sufficient discussion on prior work that incorporates MRI and demographic data using GNNs. Existing works [5-8] in this area should be acknowledged and incorporated into both the discussion and experimental comparisons to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method.\n\n3. **Missing Data Statistics**: Key data statistics, such as the number of patients, the distribution of classes, age and gender are missing. This information is crucial for transparency and reproducibility and should be included in the paper.\n\n4. **Presentation Issues**: The presentation could be improved for better clarity:\n   - (1) The figure on page 5 lacks a caption.\n   - (2) In the first sentence of Section 3.2.3, \"Figure 2b\" should refer to \"Figure 2a.\"\n   - (3) The text and edges in Figure 3 are difficult to read and should be made clearer.\n   - (4) I suggest revising Table 2 by separating binary classification results from multi-class classification results, as these settings are not directly comparable.\n\n[1] Automated anatomical labeling of activations in spm using a macroscopic anatomical parcellation of the mni mri single-subject brain.
