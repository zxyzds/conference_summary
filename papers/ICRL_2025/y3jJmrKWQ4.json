    "title": "Judging the Judges: A Systematic Investigation of Position Bias in Pairwise Comparative Assessments by LLMs",
    "abstract": "LLM-as-a-Judge presents a promising alternative to human evaluators across various tasks, but inherent biases, especially position bias \u2014 a tendency to favor solutions based on their position in the prompt \u2014 have compromised its effectiveness. Our study introduces a systematic framework to examine position bias in pairwise comparisons, focusing on repetition stability, position consistency, and preference fairness. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluations. We conducted experiments with 12 LLM judges across MTBench and DevBench, covering 22 tasks and approximately 40 solution-generating models \u2014 candidates, resulting in over 100,000 evaluation instances. Our findings confirm that position bias in capable LLM judges is not due to random chances, along with notable variations observed across judges and tasks. Moreover, position bias is weakly influenced by the length of prompt components but significantly impacted by the quality gap between solutions. These insights can help optimize judge model selections, improve benchmark design, and inform future research on debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM judges.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a systematic framework for examining the position bias of LLM-based judges. Using this framework, the authors analyze the position bias across various state-of-the-art LLMs on two benchmarks: MTBench and DevBench. In doing so, the authors find that position bias varies by judge/task, and that it is strongly correlated with the gap in quality between answers and weakly correlated with average task output length."

In doing so, the authors tend to over-generalize claims based on the characteristics of the LLM-based judges with respect to position bias (e.g., that GPT-3.5-Turbo \u201cmay be employed as a cost-effective alternative to coding evaluations\u201d since it achieves a high preference fairness score and a comparable position consistency metric to GPT-4 and GPT-4o) that are likely unfounded given a more holistic view of LLM-based judges.\n\n- Seemingly the key insight drawn is that LLM-based judges tend to exhibit position bias when the answer quality gap is small, which is interesting but not surprising, nor is very actionable. It would have been nice had the authors studied some more actionable factors related to the design of the judge such as prompt template, option modes, etc."

If so, is there a significant difference in the frequency with which LLM-based judges exhibit position bias between MTBench and DevBench? If so, can you draw any conclusions as to which factors contribute to the difference?\n- How does the computation of the answer quality gap change in a two-mode setting (e.g., no ties like on DevBench)? Is $C_t$ just 0? Are there other important considerations for a two-mode vs three-mode setting, e.g., presumably it\u2019s easier to have higher repetition stability in the two-mode setting vs. the three-mode setting since there are less options?\n- Can you provide insight into why the Gemini-1.5-flash exhibits a near 1 error rate on DevBench, but an error rate of 0 on MTBench?\n\n- Other comments:\nSec. 3.2 line 353: \u201carean -> arena\u201d.\nSec. 4 line 374: \u201cTable 4 -> Table 2\u201d.\nSec. 4 fig. 3b is seemingly missing.\nSec. 4 line 473: \u201cFig. 1(b)\u201d -> \u201cFig. 4(b)\u201d"

These concepts should be ideally be formalized and exposition around it improved so that the definitions are clear. Section 2.2. on factors impacting position bias should be improved for clarity. All figures have very small text that are unreadable.\n    \nOverall, the contributions are rather limited.\n\nOn contribution related to identification of biases: The topics described by this paper has been covered by others. Positional bias has been reported in several works. Previous work at ICLR by Zheng et al. on \"Large Language Models Are Not Robust Multiple Choice Selectors\" study similar themes are report on the aforementioned biases and ways to mitigate them. Therefore evaluation alone does not merit significance. The two other contributions on are somewhat speculative.\n\nThe error rates reported for LLama are surprisingly poor and contradict some of the findings in the literature. A 100% error rate for DevBench suggests something is amiss. Please see papers that use LLama as a baseline, e.g. \"Aligning with Human Judgement: The Role of Pairwise Preference in Large Language Model Evaluators\" and \"Fairer Preferences Elicit Improved Human-Aligned LLM Judgments\" which report on other datasets. I would encourage a recheck of results here."

The authors could provide more detailed guidelines or examples of how their findings could be applied to redesign evaluations - perhaps some of the materiel form Appendix A?\n\n- A lot of the content is included in appendices which limits the value of the main paper without these appendices. the authors could better balance the material - for example some of the material from Appendix A could be moved to the conclusions section of the paper and some of the results from Appendix G could be integrated into the main paper."

Of this, Repetition Stability (RS) evaluates the reliability of the LLM judges when presented with the same queries multiple times. Position Consistency (PC) computes how frequently a LLM judge prioritizes the same candidate when the order of candidates is swapped. Preference Fairness (PF) measures the extent to which judge models favor certain solution positions.
