    "title": "Closed-loop Diffusion Control of Complex Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "The control problems of complex physical systems have broad applications in science and engineering.  Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the environment with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency.",

                "value": "Detailed comments are summarized below:\n\n1. How restrictive is the consideration of noise-free control? There are many noise issues arising from complex engineering systems and applications. Can the proposed method be extended to account for plant, control, and measurement noise? \n\n2. Another important aspect associated with complex and practical physical systems is physical constraints. For example, physical control actions are implemented via actuators which often have upper and lower limits. That is one major reason model predictive control is useful. Can the proposed method handle physical constraints associated with control actions? \n\n3.  From Figure 2 and the limitation mentioned in the appendix, the algorithm is trained offline. In that case, it is not clear how the control is designed and employed in a real environment, as controllers are typically designed and used in practice in an interactive manner. In Figure 2, the ending time instance is T, can it be changed to T+1, as a bigger loop, to make it useful in an online/interactive manner? \n\n4. In both examples, the controls are defined as a spatiotemporal function in the PDE model, which is too ideal to be implemented in a realistic system. For PDE system control, typically, the control is implemented as a temporal function. The corresponding actuator is located in the boundary or a small part of the entire spatial domain. It would be interesting to see the results in these more realistic settings by using the proposed method. \n\n5. In the Burgers\u2019 equation example, there is no difference between the full observation and partial observation cases, because the latter case only observes and controls two parts of the entire domain. In the case considered in the manuscript, one can simply treat each observed sub-domain as a total entire domain and apply the algorithm on the PDE with new spatial coordinates/ranges/boundary conditions. Partial observation typically refers to the case using partial observation to control the entire domain. The control performance results of the unobserved state should be added to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Similarly. practical applications often have sensors installed in the boundary of PDE systems. It would be good to also add results by using boundary observation data. \n\n6. The limitations of the proposed method should be moved to the conclusion section for better readability."

The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in terms of achieving control objectives, due to closed loop control using a diffusion policy, with computation time much shorter than other diffusion policy baseline controllers."

This idea addresses one of the main shortcomings of controllers based on diffusion policies - the very long process of denoising during sampling, which is currently a major obstacle to the wider adoption of diffusion policies that have shown considerable advantages with respect to more traditional behavior cloning schemes."

What happens if full denoising is done over shorter horizons, replanning at each time step, using DiffPhyCon-1?"

The paper focuses on the computational complexity of the methods, and it proposes a technique to render closed-loop diffusion-based control computationally efficient."

Additionally, and importantly, the paper doesn't seem to offer performance guarantees for the proposed method, which makes it difficult to advocate for the proposed method in any practical use."

A characterization of the performance of the proposed method is necessary, otherwise the  method takes the form of a heuristic that may not be desirable in controls applications.\n\nAs a side note, the problem described in equation (1) is inherently an open loop problem, since no structure is imposed on the input w. In fact, the set of open-loop sequences include the set of closed-loop sequences, but the converse may not be true. Since the system dynamics are deterministic, it is also unclear why using a closed-loop strategy would be necessary. Finally, the used notation (w for control inputs and u for the system state) is very unusual and, to the best of my knowledge, never been used in any controls paper."
