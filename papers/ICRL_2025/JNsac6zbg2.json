    "title": "Uncertainty-Regularized Diffusional Subgoals for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) aims to solve complex tasks by making decisions across multiple levels of temporal abstraction. However, off-policy training of hierarchical policies faces non-stationarity issues because the low-level policy is constantly changing, which makes it difficult for the high-level policy that generates subgoals to adapt. In this paper, we propose a conditional diffusion model-based approach for subgoal generation to mitigate these non-stationarity challenges. Specifically, we employ a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on subgoal generation as a surrogate distribution to regularize the diffusion policy and inform the diffusion process about uncertain areas in the action space. We introduce adaptive inducing states to facilitate sparse GP-based subgoal generation, enhancing sample efficiency and promoting better exploration in critical regions of the state space. Building on this framework, we develop an exploration strategy that identifies promising subgoals based on the learned predictive distribution of the diffusional subgoals. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both sample efficiency and performance on challenging continuous control benchmarks compared to prior HRL methods.",

The performances of all the baselines are too close in the dense reward configuration. How do you disentangle the effect of sparse reward, and the non-stationarity, and how does your proposed algorithm cause improvement?\n\n3. The paper mentions that HIDI has more sample efficiency. How do you demonstrate that? It would be beneficial to define a measure of sample efficiency e.g. number of samples trained to reach a target performance, to compare all the baselines more precisely on this metric, and not on the performance plot only.\n\n4. What is the reasoning behind using the RBF kernel aside from the fact that it is a common kernel for GPs? Since part of the contribution of the paper\u2019s algorithm is using GPs, it would be beneficial to experiment on other kernels too, based on the assumptions about data\n\n5. In Table 3, the paper mentions the hyperparameters of HIDI. What about other baselines?  it would be beneficial to mention how hyperparameters were dealt with for other baselines, and across environments, and if any tuning was done, to make a more fair comparison\n\n6. Different values for the new hyperparameters of HIDI were only compared on Ant Maze. How are the values for them going to be chosen for other environments in general, when applying HIDI to a new environment?"

                "value": "1. The paper poses a problem of off-policy learning in the abstract and introduction, which was the same problem HIRO was designed to solve. However, the contributions of this paper upon HIRO does not appear to address the non-stationarity issue. Instead they propose a diffusion model as a subgoal generator, without motivating how such a model can address the off-policy problem.\n2. Additionally, their second contribution, the GP prior seems to model the uncertainty over the subgoals. This was not directly related to the original off-policy problem, rather to help with uncertainty estimation on these diffusional subgoals.\n3. The paper claims the GP model \u201cpotentially reduces the amount of training data needed for the diffusional model to converge\u201d, but this was never tested. An experiment that could verify whether this is the case would be very useful for researchers seeking to incorporate diffusion as a generative model in reinforcement learning.\n4. Line 250 is needlessly speculative: GPs were claimed \u201cpotentially leading to more robust and sample-efficient learning\u201d, but Figure 3 shows that ablating the GP does not result in any significant performance drop.\n5. It was stated that \u201cdiffusion models typically require a substantial amount of training data\u201d, it would have been nice if the paper cited instances of this problem happening.\n6. The paper claimed HIDI was more sample efficient than a count-based alternative (HESS), but they only show the performance of the two algorithms, no metric measuring exploration. Could HIDI be more sample efficient because it is exploring less? Since exploration is not directly related to the main problem the paper is addressing, this is not detrimental, but the reader may find the result distracting.\n7. The paper\u2019s last contribution of using inducing states is a clever trick to reduce the computational complexity of the GP, but they claim this gives better exploration. This was not empirically tested.\n8. The exploration aspect of the sparse GP seems orthogonal to the paper\u2019s initial objective of addressing the non-stationarity of a changing low level policy. Wouldn\u2019t adding exploration make the higher policy training even more off-policy, as the low level policy has an epsilon chance of exploring?\n9. The Environments and Empirical Analyses are written as subsections of the Related Works section. This should be a separate section.\n10. It should be clarified that all the claims of \u201cHow do various design choices within HIDI impact its empirical performance and effectiveness?\u201d are for the AntMaze W env\n\n**Minor Fixes**\n1. Is the sparse reward setting really sparse? The -1 per step signal is still informative for the lower level policy which reaches subgoals. A sparser reward could be 0 everywhere and +1 at the main goal.\n2. Line 176: make the N calligraphic and the \\mu and \\Sigma boldface to match the equation.\n3. Line 179: The learnt noise \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\theta_h} was introduced, but never defined anywhere. This may be standard notation with diffusion models, but having it explained (even in the appendix) can help readers with a reinforcement learning background understand.\n4. Line 227: Introduces \\mathbf{X}, but never defines or uses this matrix anywhere.\n5. Line 254: Typo \u201cAssuming the hyperparameters \u03b8gp are learned and fixed\u201d -> \u201cAssuming the hyperparameters \u03b8gp are learned and then fixed\u201d\n6. Line 259: This sentence needs to be re-structured, as its meaning is ambiguous. \u201cWe denote the \u201cimaginary\u201d subgoals g \u0304 and they are not real observations without including a noise variance for them.\u201d\n7. Line 423: This paragraph gives details of the dimensionality of the goal spaces across envs, it may also help the reader to know what the dimension of the original state/observation space is for each environment."

Were all the baselines HIDI was compared against tuned? If so, over what ranges?\n4. Line 204: It is unclear how the objective in equation (7) mitigates non-stationarity in hierarchical models.\n5. All environments were single-task environments. Shouldn\u2019t the usefulness of subgoals be tested on multi-task environments, where the re-usuability of subgoals comes into play.\n6. Line 313: The GP\u2019s mean is described as \u201cpromising subgoal\u201d. If this is promising for the main task, why then is it used as an exploration subgoal? It would be helpful if the meaning of \u201cpromising\u201d could be clarified, and if the paper could describe how the mean of the GP\u2019s predictive distribution would be promising in terms of exploration.\n7. Why were the ablations (Fig 3 and 4) only conducted on Ant-Maze\n8. Is the Baseline curve in Fig 3 (left) effectively HIRO? If so, it would be useful to mention that in section 4.2 under \u201cHow do various design choices within HIDI impact its empirical performance and effectiveness?\u201d"

                "value": "1. The authors state (line 204) that the diffusion objective aids in aligning the high-level policy\u2019s behavior with the \"optimal\" relabeled subgoals, thus addressing non-stationarity. However, they provide no motivation, examples, or proof to clarify how or why the diffusion objective achieves this alignment.\n2. The authors claim (line 249) that Gaussian Process (GP) priors provide uncertainty measures, regularize the diffusion process, and enhance the robustness and sample efficiency in learning. While the uncertainty aspect is clear, the other claims about regularization, robustness, and sample efficiency remain unconvincing.\n3. Just as there is little clear motivation for using GP priors, the rationale for the proposed exploration strategy is also unclear\u2014particularly why $\\mu^*$ should be considered a good estimate of promising subgoals. Based on the results in Figure 3, HIDI and HIDI-A perform similarly, which suggests that including this exploration strategy may be redundant.\n4. I don\u2019t think that providing an external reward of -1 per step qualifies as sparse. It might appear sparse for the high-level policy since it achieves 0 only when it is near the goal, but it still provides useful feedback for subgoal learning via intrinsic reward.\u00a0If the reward were instead set to 0 for each time step, that would make the problem genuinely sparse and challenging to solve.\n5. The assertion that \"increasing is better,\" as demonstrated in Figure 3 (middle) on lines 504-508, seems unconvincing since there are instances where  $N=3$ slightly outperforms  $N=5$.\n6. The ablation studies were only conducted on Ant Maze environment, and I can\u2019t find the other even in the appendix.\n\n**Minor nitpicks**:\n\n1. In Figure 3 (right) and Figure 4, all settings appear identical to me, so the statements in lines 509-520 seem redundant.\n2. Consider using distinct letters for the different diffusion models. Having two instances of $\\epsilon$ with different meanings is confusing.\n3. The $N$ is not the right format on line 176.\n4. The underscore for $\\epsilon$  is small on line 185."

Why do you use reparameterization of the subgoals with diffusion models in the deterministic policy gradient objective?\n4. Do you relabel the subgoals to ones that maximize the log probability as depcited on line 201?\n5. Is the $N$ in the diffusion process different from one in the Gaussian Processes?\n6. It is still unclear to me how you choose the $\\bar{s}$. Do you randomly sample some representative points, or are they subset of the $\\mathcal{D}_h$, or something else?\n7.
