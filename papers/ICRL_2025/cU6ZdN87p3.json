    "title": "Certifiably Robust RAG against Retrieval Corruption Attacks",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been shown vulnerable to retrieval corruption attacks: an attacker can inject malicious passages into retrieval results to induce inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose RobustRAG as the first defense framework against retrieval corruption attacks. The key insight of RobustRAG is an isolate-then-aggregate strategy: we isolate passages into disjoint groups, generate LLM responses based on the concatenated passages from each isolated group, and then securely aggregate these responses for a robust output. To instantiate RobustRAG, we design keyword-based and decoding-based algorithms for securely aggregating unstructured text responses. Notably, RobustRAG can achieve certifiable robustness: we can formally prove and certify that, for certain queries, RobustRAG can always return accurate responses, even when an adaptive attacker has full knowledge of our defense and can arbitrarily inject a small number of malicious passages. We evaluate RobustRAG on open-domain QA and long-form text generation datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability.",

                "value": "There is one major weakness and several minor weaknesses.\n\n**Major:**\n- First, the inference cost of the proposed framework will significantly increase compared to the vanilla RAG. Given a query, the proposed method requires generating multiple responses to determine the final majority vote. If the system employing the proposed method cannot perform parallel generation, the latency in obtaining the final answer will also increase drastically. I believe this limitation will significantly impact the real-world use of the proposed method.\n\n**Minor:**\n- The overall idea of the work is not novel to me. Essentially, it is a randomized smoothing/majority vote technique applied in a new context, RAG.\n- Given the majority vote nature, the proposed scenario cannot handle cases where the number of poisoned responses exceeds the number of clean ones. I acknowledge that this limitation is not only associated with this particular work but also with methods that use the majority vote concept in general. However, I feel that in RAG, there should be better alternatives to address this security risk, such as controlling access to the RAG database."

Even including the appendix, I suggest that the authors add the settings of the attack experiments in the appendix.\n\n### 2. Lacks comparison experiments\nHow much impact will RobustRAG have on performance compared to RAG without any attack risk? Since it is necessary to prevent retrieval corruption attacks, it is also necessary to apply RobustRAG all the time. But for benign setups, will RobustRAG affect performance? I suggest the authors add this experiment."

I think the worst case should be equal, not outnumber.\nIn line 141-142, \"the attacker can only manipulate a fraction of retrieved passages\", how much does a fraction refer to specifically?"
