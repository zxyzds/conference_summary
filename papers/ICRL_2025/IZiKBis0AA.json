    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to fragment-based antibiotic drug design design. We introduce a tool called FILTER, which uses chemical structure data, pathway information, and protein targets to predict pharmacokinetic properties of existing and novel drugs. We report on three distinct experiments utilizing FILTER. The first experiment is an in silico analysis that recreates the historical discovery of penicillin derivatives, validating our approach against known outcomes. The second experiment explores the combination of functional groups from different antibiotic classes to create molecules with multiple mechanisms of action. We refer to this approach as hybridization as all synthesized molecules are composed of fragments from both classes. Our final experiment is forward-looking as it explores new chemical spaces to build a library of promising compounds for further antibiotic development. Throughout all these experiments, FILTER serves as an indispensable oracle, predicting physical properties and potential therapeutic efficacy of the new molecular architectures, aiming to accelerate the drug development process and address the challenge of antibiotic resistance. Our approach represents an ongoing, significant shift from traditional drug discovery methods, emphasizing the role of innovative technologies in combating the urgent global threat of antimicrobial resistance.",

                "value": "This work proposed a machine learning framework called FILTER that sought to predict chemical properties of exisiting and novel antibiotics. By integrating data from multiple sources, FILTER attempted to arrive at novel understanding of the mechanism of action (MoA) of the drugs. Overall, however, the presentation of the work was confusing and a lot of the claims made in the work could not be assessed due to lack of details."

Neither aspect could be found in this work. The task-dataset combinations in this work have been studied extensively in the past, with the possible exception of [DrugBank 6.0](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/D1/D1265/7416367) published less than 1 year ago and contained $ 72 \\ \\\\% $ more FDA-approved drugs.\n- The properties in Table 3 is only a proper subset of those listed in Table 2. Yet the caption of Table 3 reads \"Summary of results across all models and target properties...\"\n- The presentation in this work was generally quite repetitive and a lot of the contents in methods and results sections can be moved to the discussion section."

Have you tried to generate other molecules based on other existing drugs?\n- How were the 3 different aspects of the molecules (chemical properties, molecular pathways and docking affinities) related to each other? \n- What do the different colours in Figure 3 represent (presumably different classes of molecules)?\n- More generally, could you provide detailed exposition of *all* models trained in this work? This would include information on each layer of neural networks, hyperparameters and training specifications. If helpful, use both tables and figures.\n- Could you also provide information on hardware used, training time and validation loss plots?"
