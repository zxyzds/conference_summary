    "abstract": "Transformers exhibit exceptional in-context learning capabilities, yet the theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms remain limited.\nA recent work (Elhage et al., 2021) identified a \"rich\" in-context mechanism known as induction head, contrasting with \"lazy\" $n$-gram models that overlook long-range dependencies.\nIn this work, we provide both approximation and optimization analyses of how transformers implement induction heads.\nIn the approximation analysis, we formalize both standard and generalized induction head mechanisms, and examine whether two-layer single- or multi-head transformers can efficiently implement them, with an emphasis on the distinct role of each transformer submodule.\nFor the optimization analysis, we study the training dynamics on a synthetic mixed target, composed of a 4-gram and an in-context 2-gram component. This setting enables us to precisely characterize the entire training process and uncover an *abrupt transition* from lazy (4-gram) to rich (induction head) mechanisms as training progresses.",

                "value": "- This work provides an analysis of how transformers implement induction heads, approaching the problem from both approximation and optimization perspectives. The theoretical results appear rigorous; however, the model setup seems overly simplified. Specifically, the study is limited to a two-layer transformer model, with and without feed-forward networks (FFNs), a framework initially explored in a seminal paper [1] and subsequently developed by numerous follow-up studies. Given this extensive literature, the contribution here appears somewhat incremental, with limited novelty in the analytical approach and the techniques remaining relatively standard. Expanding the analysis to a more sophisticated and realistic setting, as seen in recent work [2], would significantly strengthen the contribution. Without this, the impact of the results may be constrained, and it is unclear if they meet the high standards for significance.\n\n- Additionally, given the simplified setup and use of synthetic toy examples, I have reservations about the generalizability of these findings for interpreting real-world transformers. I would suggest that the authors conduct extensive empirical experiments on widely-used models to validate the applicability and robustness of their theoretical results.\n\n- it would be valuable if the theoretical insights could yield practical implications. Specifically, can the approximation results inform new methods, or could the optimization insights benefit transformer training? If so, this would meaningfully enhance the contribution. Otherwise, the practical significance of the work may remain limited.\n\n[1] Elhage, Nelson, Neel Nanda, Catherine Olsson, Tom Henighan, Nicholas Joseph, Ben Mann, Amanda Askell et al. \"A mathematical framework for transformer circuits.\" Transformer Circuits Thread 1, no. 1 (2021): 12.\n\n[2] Chen, Siyu, Heejune Sheen, Tianhao Wang, and Zhuoran Yang. \"Unveiling induction heads: Provable training dynamics and feature learning in transformers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.10559 (2024)."

In particular, the way they are currently stated seem to imply that such results hold for _any_ number of heads $H$. In the proofs, however, it seems that $H$ cannot be arbitrary, and actually has to be large enough and possibly dependent on $n$, unless I misunderstood something. It would be helpful to clarify this further.\n2. In the gradient flow analysis of Section 5.1.3, you consider a layer-wise training paradigm in which you first train only the first-layer, and then you fix it to train the second one. I was wondering if the experimental results of Figure 2 are also obtained using this paradigm. I was wondering if this assumption is also insightful in practice, i.e., if when training the two layers at the same time, you could see experimentally that the first layer is learned before the second layer, or if in general the two layers are learned together in practice.\n3. Minor concern: in the main text you put some amount of emphasis on a novel Lyapunov function that is used in the proof, but then this function never appears in the text and is relegated at the end of the appendix. In the final version, I would either give more space to it in the main text, explaining why this function is important/novel, or put less emphasis on it."

I think in general we have dimension mismatch problems here based on the current notation. I would appreciate clarification of this issue. \n- The final value of $C_{q,n}$ is not specific clearly in the proof. I think this value is actually quite important as it determines the minimum number of heads required (I think this actually could be included in the main text.)\n- Can you elaborate on the meaning of the notation $I(z=x_{L-2})$ (and similar ones) on page 7?\n- In Figure 2, experiments setup is not mentioned. Also x-axis is not specified. More importantly, we can see a drop in the loss of IH term in the first phase of the training, this is in contrast to the theoretical results. Can you elaborate please?\n- In Theorem 5, could you explain in what variables the asymptotics are?\n- I think the writing of the insights around lines 243-250 can be improved. \n- The paper focuses on a specific format of relative positional embedding. I think the paper could be more upfront on this and state this more clearly throughout the paper. \n- Line 451, \"without loss of ambiguity\" seems to be a typo. \n- Regarding the second weakness, I'd appreciate any evidence/explanation that the proven optimization dynamics would also show up in more natural setting."

Specifically, they show upper bounds on the \nsize of transformers needed to implement variants of induction heads. The result here is not very surprising, as it uses basic transformer components to push tokens several steps ahead to facilitate the induction. It also seems to require increasing the dimension of the transformer as longer induction memory is requested, and again this seems intuitively natural, since this is what\u2019s required for pushing n tokens forward in time, so they can be used in the induction. \n\nThe second part asks about the learning process of induction heads. Towards this end, it considers a data generation mechanism that has two components: an n-gram and an induction head. It shows that the learning process goes through several stages where different components are learned. This part is potentially interesting, but I think it could benefit from more work before publication. Some points are:\na. I like the idea that there\u2019s a type of inductive bias towards n-grams (also appearing in Bietti, 2023), but it would be more interesting to see if this is a true inductive bias if you had a setting where both n-gram and induction fit the data and learning chooses one over the other. In your current setup they both must be learned, because the output contains both, so I\u2019m not sure what we learn from the fact that one is learned before the other, but eventually they are all learned.\nb. If I understand correctly, the model has six learnable parameters. It\u2019s possible that some observations (eg single fixed point) are due to this simplification. I would have liked to see at least simulations that show which phenomena appear in larger models.\nc. Generally, I am missing more explanation and intuition why this particular model was chosen, and what are the implications for learning in real models.\nd. I am missing more discussion of the relation to Bietti, who also propose some theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics. \ne. Please also discuss relation to https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11004"

Can you comment on the relation between your results and Bietti (2023) equation 7, which also shows a two layer implementation? \n4. Your induction head averages over all previous appearances of the context. However, it isn\u2019t clear that this is indeed the behavior of induction heads, or that it is even desirable. Wouldn\u2019t we want to output, say, the most common element, or some encoding of the distribution over the next element?\n5. The dependence on parameter q in Theorem 4.3 is confusing because we don\u2019t see the dependence of C_{n,q} on q. Can you present a bound that optimizes over q? \n6. It seems like the dimension of the transformer in Theorem 4.3 needs to scale with n, \u201cthe induction length\u201d. This seems rather undesirable, and it is not clear that it is necessary. Can you provide corresponding lower bounds, or provide empirical support for this need?\n7. Typo: \u201cthe loss convergences\u201d\n8. In the definition of f*_{G4}, shouldn't it be L-2 (not T-2)?\n9.
