    "title": "SAGMAN: Stability Analysis  of Graph Neural Networks  on the Manifolds",
    "abstract": "Modern graph neural networks (GNNs) can be sensitive to changes in the input graph structure and node features, potentially resulting in unpredictable behavior and degraded performance. In this work, we introduce a spectral framework known as SAGMAN for examining the stability of GNNs. This framework assesses the distance distortions that arise from the nonlinear mappings of GNNs between the input and output manifolds: when two nearby nodes on the input manifold are mapped (through a GNN model) to two distant ones on the output manifold, it implies a large distance distortion and thus a poor GNN stability.  We propose a distance-preserving graph dimension reduction (GDR) approach that utilizes spectral graph embedding and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to create low-dimensional input/output graph-based manifolds for meaningful stability analysis. Our empirical evaluations show that SAGMAN effectively assesses the stability of each node when subjected to various edge or feature perturbations, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the stability of GNNs, extending to applications within recommendation systems. Furthermore, we illustrate its utility in downstream tasks, notably in enhancing GNN stability and facilitating adversarial targeted attacks.",

Hence, for any pair of nodes, e.g., p and q, their distance quotient on the embedded manifold is leveraged as the evaluation metric for measuring GNN (node level) stability.

When presenting the notation of PGM and the reason for preserving the resistance distance is essential, the introduction of stable or unstable nodes needs to be enriched in Appendix A.6; I couldn't find any formal definition or threshold of identifying what exactly is stable/unstable nodes.\n\n3. I think the stability induced by the algorithm is limited to the GNNs that smooth the node features. What will be the conclusion/influence for those GNNs that typically fit the heterophilic graphs or can induce a sharpening dynamic to the node features? As in this case, each row of X will tend to be dissimilar to each other. \n\n4. Perhaps a hyperparameter study for the algorithm with several components is necessary here.\n\n5. Only to my view, as the proposed algorithm contains many components, they seems not be presented as a whole pipeline in the paper. Therefore, the author is suggested to refine the structure of the paper, e.g., adding some inter-contextual contents between each step. \n\nSome minor changes are suggested as follows: \n1. On row 234, the input embedding matrix $X = U_k$, I think $X$ should be the initial feature?\n\n2. On row 759, the Appendix A.1 is self-refered."
