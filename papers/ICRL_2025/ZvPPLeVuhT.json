    "title": "ReGRAF: Training free Prompt Refinement via Gradient Flow for Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly advanced segmentation, object detection, and image classification tasks. \nHowever, SAM and its fine-tuned variants necessitate substantial manual effort for prompt generation and additional training for specific applications. \nRecent methods have addressed these limitations by integrating SAM into one-shot and few-shot segmentation, enabling auto-prompting through semantic alignment between query and support images. \nDespite these advancements, they still generate inadequate prompts that degrade segmentation quality. \nTo tackle this limitation, we introduce ReGRAF (Refinement via GRAdient Flow), a training-free method that refines prompts through gradient flow derived from SAM's mask decoder. ReGRAF seamlessly integrates into SAM-based auto-prompting frameworks and is theoretically proven to refine segmentation masks with high efficiency and precision. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ReGRAF consistently improves segmentation quality across various benchmarks, effectively mitigating false positives without requiring additional training or architectural modifications.",

                "value": "This paper proposes  ReGRAF (Refinement via Gradient Flow), which is a training free module that can be added to auto-prompting methods (such as PerSAM or Matcher) for promotable segmentation models (such as SAM). ReGRAF relies on using gradient flow, logits from mask decoder and query embeddings to update embeddings of the query, to best match that of support image. ReGRAF is an iterative method that iteratively updates embeddings with no need to learnable parameters. \n\nAuthors tested the proposed method on 2 tasks of semantic segmentation and part segmentation on total of 5 different datasets and a combination of 7 baselines stemmed from variations on 2 major baseline methods (PerSAM or Matcher)"

This causes a lack of clarity on weaknesses of the method and a fair understanding of performance.\n- The proposed method seem to rely on a number of hyper parameters (Iterations T, entropy regularization factor, and step size). The paper does not provide any experiments to show sensitivity of the method to these parameters and their impact on performance."

This was not clear to me. How in accurate and why?\n- Table 1 shows a wide range of performance improvements depending on the baseline and dataset. Would be great is authors can share some insight for when their method could have more significant improvements vs marginal. Was there any trends in the results?\n- What are some cases that the method will fail and provide worse results than baseline?"

Recently, one-shot and few-shot methods such as PerSAM and Matcher have been proposed to generate the auto prompting via query and supporting set. However, the auto-prompt generation process is far from perfect, missing prompts or error prompts can appear. As a result, the resulting mask is not aligned with the support set well. This paper proposed to leveraging additional cues to iteratively sample prompts for improving one/few-shot segmentation performance. As the ground truth masks are not available for correcting the prompts, the author proposed to leverage gradient flow from the decoder to improve the prompt sampling, and therefore, the final segmentation results."

Specifically, the author computes the gradient flow from the decoder to align the distribution of the query and support embeddings. Afterward, the updated query embedding is used to compute the similarity map for a new round of interactive segmentation. \n\nThe proposed method has been validated on both the part segmentation dataset and semantic segmentation, which demonstrates its broad applicability. \n\nA theoretical analysis has been provided to show the proposed method's convergence and convergence rate. \n\nThe presentation of the paper is well-structured and the equations are clearly displayed."

From the qualitative examples, it seems that the refinement process is quite effective in aligning different semantic hieratical levels of the target and support mask. For example, in figure 5, some object-level base predictions are correctly adjusted to part masks with the proposed methods. In figure 4, some missing components are correctly saved back. Does the proposed method aim to resolve the semantic hieratical ambiguity or mainly the details correction? If it is the first part, then it is unclear to me how is this achieved. As it is not well explained in the method part or the motivation part. \n\nBesides, the examples displayed achieve significant improvement. However, quantitative evaluation shows the opposite. Are there some examples becoming worse after refinement? It would be nice to show some scatter plots of the sample-wise IoU before and after refinement so that we have a better idea of the advantages and the limitations of the proposed method. \n\nI miss the ablation on the number of refinement times."

Secondly, apart from the comparisons with baseline methods in Tables 1 and 2, there is a lack of analytical experiments and an examination of hyper-parameters. Thirdly, the improvements shown in Tables 1 and 2 are overall modest, with many of the increments less than 0.5%.

Please explain line 359, \"gradient estimation in equation (12) becomes inaccurate with a large number of iterations.\" Why does an increase in the number of iterations lead to inaccuracies in the results? Theoretically, shouldn't the process gradually converge to a value near the optimal one?\n3.In section 4.2.2, the author states that the numerical improvement is not significant, explaining that the segmentation effect is better, but these individual examples are not very persuasive. Perhaps some better evaluation criteria could more comprehensively demonstrate the enhancement brought by the method."
