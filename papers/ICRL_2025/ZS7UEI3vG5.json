    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning from truncated samples: instead of observing\nsamples from some underlying population $p^\\ast$, we observe only the examples that fall in some survival set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ whose probability mass (measured with respect to $p^\\ast$) is at least $\\alpha$.  Assuming membership oracle access to the truncation set $S$, prior works obtained algorithms for the case where $p^\\ast$ is Gaussian or more generally an exponential family with strongly convex likelihood --- albeit with a super-polynomial \ndependency on the (inverse) survival mass $1/\\alpha$\nboth in terms of runtime and in number of oracle calls to the set $S$.  In this work we design a new learning method with runtime and query complexity polynomial in $1/\\alpha$.  \nOur result significantly improves over the prior works \nby focusing on efficiently solving the underlying optimization problem using a general\npurpose optimization algorithm with minimal assumptions.",

                "value": "This paper revisits the problem of learning an exponential family of distributions under truncated samples. The main focus is the dependence of the runtime and sample complexity on the mass of the truncation set. \n\nIn the truncated samples model, the samples are only observed when they fall into a subset S of the domain that has some measure $\\alpha$. Such a sampling oracle can be implemented using a membership oracle for the set S. Although for constant values of the mass $\\alpha$ the sample (and query) complexity asymptotically matches the bounds from prior work on the problem, there is an exponential improvement in the dependence on $1/\\alpha$, when $\\alpha$ gets close to $0$. Another difference from prior work is the use of weaker assumptions, which also leads to a weaker type of learner. More specifically, while prior work by Lee et\u2019 al can estimate the parameter vector of the exponential family up to error $\\varepsilon$, in this paper, the algorithm is a proper learner that outputs an exponential family that has small KL divergence with the true distribution. \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the novelty lies in the definition of a sequence of constrained optimization problems. Specifically, the authors use projected SGD in a region where the negative log likelihood is not allowed to exceed a certain threshold during each iteration. This prohibits the algorithm from moving to regions in the parameter space that would assign very small mass to the truncation set and seems to be crucial for achieving the exponential improvement in terms of the inverse mass $1/\\alpha$ of that set S. \n\n\n\nMinor comments:\n\n-Line 53: \u201cresoursed\u201d->\u201cresourses\u201d\n\n-Lines 109-114: The example here needs some rephrasing. I get the point you are making, but technically, when you fix a set (S=[0,1] in this case), the mass assigned to it and the variance of the distribution, there is a unique distribution (NOT multiple ones) satisfying these constraints. Maybe you could say $O(\\alpha)$ mass.\n\n-Lines 131 and 371: In the second argument of the KL distance, it should be $\\hat{\\theta}$ in the subscript.\n\n-Line 388: Usually the word \u201crequires\u201d is used for lower bounds. Maybe say \u201ca good initialization can be found\u201d\n\n-Line 399: \u201cestimate of\u201d->\u201dbound on\u201d\n\n-Line 448: Proof of Observation 3.8: The statement seems reasonable,  but I think that the proof is incomplete. You show that the exponential is at most 1, but you need something stronger since it could be that $Pr_{\\theta^\\prime}[S]>Pr_{\\theta}[S]$, right?\n\n-Line 490: \u201c$SE(K,\\beta)$\u201d->\u201c$SE(K^2,\\beta)$\u201d"

                "value": "This paper studies the problem of learning a high-dimensional probability distribution from \"truncated samples\" -- that is, the goal is to learn a distribution $p$ given samples from $p$ conditioned on some event $S$, called the \"survival set\".This is not possible with reasonable (polynomial) sample complexity for an arbitrary distribution $p$, so, like prior work, the paper focuses on exponential family distributions.\n\nMore concretely, the model is that one gets:\n\n-- samples from $p$ conditioned on $S$; the set $S$ is not known to the algorithm\n-- access to an oracle which takes as input a probability distribution $q$ and returns a samples from $q$ conditioned on $S$\n\nHere $p$ and $q$ should be exponential family distributions so that they have a short description which can be handed to the oracle. There is a further constraint that the probability mass of $S$ under $p$ and $q$ is at least some parameter $\\alpha > 0$. As $\\alpha$ gets small, this problem gets harder, since we are observing only samples from some low-probability event under $p$.\n\nPrior work showed how to accomplish this task for exponential family distributions, with sample complexity and running time depending polynomially on dimension of the distribution and the inverse of the accuracy to which the distribution is learned, but super-polynomially on $1/\\alpha$. (Prior work achieved only quasipolynomial dependence.)\n\nThis dependence on survival probability is important for overall running time, because one way to implement the sampling oracle is via rejection sampling, using a membership oracle for $S$ and a sampling algorithm for $q$. But the running time of such an implementation will be about $1/\\alpha$ to get a single sample.\n\nThe main contribution of this work is to give an algorithm with running time and sample complexity having polynomial dependence on dimension, inverse of the accuracy, and $1/\\alpha$. My understanding is that this result is novel even in the special case of Gaussian distributions.\n\nThe problem is extremely well motivated -- truncation is a common situation for \"in the wild\" datasets. And the technical contribution is certainly sufficient for ICLR. I recommend acceptance."
