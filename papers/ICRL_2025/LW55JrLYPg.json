    "title": "Pursuing Better Decision Boundaries for Long-Tailed Object Detection via Category Information Amount",
    "abstract": "In object detection, the number of instances is commonly used to determine whether a dataset follows a long-tailed distribution, implicitly assuming that the model will perform poorly on categories with fewer instances. This assumption has led to extensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance distributions. However, even in datasets with relatively balanced instance counts, models still exhibit bias toward certain categories, indicating that instance count alone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the concept and measurement of category informativeness. We observe a significant negative correlation between a category\u2019s informativeness and its accuracy, suggesting that informativeness more accurately reflects the learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose the Informativeness-Guided Angular Margin Loss (IGAM Loss), which dynamically adjusts the decision space of categories according to their informativeness, thereby mitigating category bias in long-tailed datasets. IGAM Loss not only achieves superior performance on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0 and COCO-LT but also demonstrates significant improvements for underrepresented categories in non-long-tailed datasets like Pascal VOC. Extensive experiments confirm the potential of category informativeness as a tool and the generalizability of our proposed method.",

Thus, the authors need to conduct experiments across datasets such as LVIS and COCO-LT to verify that the results are consistent with the observations made from PASCAL VOC.\n\n__2.__ The proposed method was evaluated on established CNN-based models (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN). However, with the emergence of various ViT-based object detection networks (e.g., DETR, H-DETR), it is crucial to assess whether the observed effects are specific to the tested models or if they generalize across different architectures.\n\n__3.__ More importantly, the authors did not compare their method with recent long-tailed object detection approaches. Notably, [Ref_1] includes experiments on both CNN- and ViT-based models and appears to outperform the proposed method. A comprehensive comparison and analysis distinguishing this work from such methods are necessary.\n\n__4.__ The same issue applies to [Ref_2]. Although the proposed method may seem reasonable at first glance, the experimental validation is not sufficiently convincing. A logical comparison and thorough analysis with recent approaches, including those presented in [Ref_1] and [Ref_2], are essential to substantiate the contributions and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n__5.__ Could the category bias in balanced datasets be influenced by factors such as object scale or degree of occlusion?\n\n[Ref_1] L.

                "value": "The paper's observations on the problem are reasonable. However, I do not feel that the method proposed by the paper is strongly related to the proposed scenarios: long-tail distribution and object detection. Here are the corresponding reasons:\n1. In the introduction stage, if the author simply wanted to propose the concept of category information, then there is no need to compare in the long-tailed scenario, and it is more direct to show the performance with information in the general scenario. If the author wants to explain it in the long-tailed scenario in Figure 1, then the performance compared with the category information can be in the previous long-tailed dataset. So I think there is no alignment here.\n2. In the first paragraph of Section 3.1, the authors mention that \u2018the amount of information should be extracted from the classification module\u2019. So why not address this issue directly in the classification process, but instead put it in the object detection scenario, and emphasize that this work is the first to directly report on the widespread bias present in object detection models in object detection? How about classification?\n3. In the experimental part, the three methods compared in Table 5 are all long-tailed methods. And they are all between 2021 and 2022. Should they be compared with newer methods? In addition, as mentioned in 1, if the author's intention in Figure 1 holds true, should this method be equally effective in the case of networks such as Faster R-CNN on relatively balanced Pascal VOC datasets?"

                "value": "1. Figure 2 only shows information about two attributes. How is the class-wise average precision reflected?\n2. In formula 6, how does the operation of loss affect the compression and expansion of the decision space? For example, if i is the least informative, then the m_ij of other components j are all negative. Intuitively, it increases the second term in the denominator and thus increases the loss L, but why does this operation compress i's decision space?\n3. In the previous formulas 1 and 2, the author used variance to represent the amount of information. If m_ij is negative, it means that the amount of information (variance) of i is already relatively small, so why do we need to continue to compress its decision space?"
