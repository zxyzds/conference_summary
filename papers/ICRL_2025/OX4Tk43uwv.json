    "title": "SERDES Link Training with Edge Inference: Neural-Network Driven Discrete Optimization to Maximize Link Efficiency",
    "abstract": "Meeting the growing data demands of modern AI applications requires efficient, high-speed communication links.  In this paper, we propose an edge inference framework that leverages integer linear programming (ILP) and neural network-based discrete optimization to optimize non-uniform quantization levels in programmable analog-to-digital converter (ADC) receivers. The goal is to determine the optimal quantization levels and their assignment for each bit pattern across multi-lane high-speed links. Although ILP provides high-quality solutions, its computational cost makes it unsuitable for on-chip use. To address this, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using ILP solver results, enabling efficient on-chip edge inference. Our custom loss function, which outperforms standard metrics like cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE), reduces area metric errors from 29\\% to less than 2\\%. By deploying the CNN within a microcontroller, our system adapts to changing channel conditions, improving error rates and reducing energy consumption, thereby maximizing link efficiency",

In section 6, the author only evaluates the model on a simple case (k=2); a higher k, like 4, is not presented in this paper. Moreover, the author should report the golden baseline using ILP as a reference to assess the methods' effectiveness.\n* The target devices have only up to 2-bit ENOB, questioning the method's effectiveness for practical ADC with higher ENOB.

The authors assert that the ILP solver consumes significant hardware resources, rendering it impractical for high-speed SERDES interfaces; hence, they propose using a CNN instead. However, it is well-established that CNN architectures can vary considerably in terms of hardware resource requirements depending on their size and complexity. The paper does not specify the size of the CNN model employed, nor does it provide a comparative analysis of the hardware resource consumption between the CNN and the ILP solver. Consequently, the claim that CNN is more hardware-friendly lacks substantiation.\n\nFurthermore, the paper contains an excessive amount of information regarding the ILP method itself, which detracts from the primary focus of the study. Instead, the authors should emphasize the specific advantages of utilizing a CNN, supported by experimental data rather than relying solely on theoretical derivations. By providing more convincing evidence and clearer explanations, the paper could enhance its overall credibility and impact in the field."
