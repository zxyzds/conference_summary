    "title": "Time-dependent Development of Scientific Discourse: A Novel Approach Using UMAP and Word Embeddings",
    "abstract": "This study presents a method for visualizing the time-dependent development of a scientific discipline using UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and text embeddings. This study demonstrates how the evolution of research interests and topics in a specific field can be mapped over time by encoding the abstracts of scholarly articles into a high-dimensional space and then projecting them into a 3D space. This computational approach converts the history of discourse into a point-cloud that can be further studied as a manifold and as a time series, which leads to new insights into the dynamics of scholarly discourse and the emergence and disappearance of research themes.",

                "value": "Unfortunately, I believe that the paper is not a good fit for the ICLR conference. The paper does not make a significant contribution to the field of representation learning or machine learning. The paper presents a qualitative exploratory analysis of the embeddings of paper abstracts over time, which does not represent a significant advancement from the common practice of analyzing embeddings that are performed routinely in various contexts. \n\nFor instance, conferences like NeurIPS have been providing embedding-based visualization tools for multiple years. Companies like nomic.ai have been providing the temporal analysis of scientific literature over time at the scale of millions of papers (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.10.536208v1). Research groups like AllenAI, Northwestern University (e.g., Dashun Wang), University of Chicago (James Evans), Indiana University (YY Ahn), Northeastern University (Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si), Stanford University (Dan Jurafsky), and many others have been extensively employing paper embeddings and other related methods to study scientific discourse and evolution. Given this long list of existing work (with much more sophisticated analyses) that I can't list all here (and not cited by the paper), the manuscript would need to provide a lot more results and analysis to make meaningful contribution. I'm sorry to say that the paper misses the mark quite substantially in this regard.\n\nAn important issue that the author should also pay attention to is that we shouldn't simply use the UMAP axes as meaningful coordinates. This has been extensively critiqued by Lior Pachter and other researchers (e.g., https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v1)."

            "questions": {
                "value": "The paper would need a thorough survey of existing literature. The current version misses pretty much all important literature in the field of science of science and scientometrics, particularly the extensive usage of embedding in these fields. \n\nI think the paper would need a clearer research question and a concrete, quantitative analysis. \n\nHowever, even if these issues are addressed, I think the paper would not be a good fit for ICLR."
