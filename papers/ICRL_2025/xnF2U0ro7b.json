    "abstract": "Bilateral trade models the problem of facilitating trades between a seller and a buyer having private valuations for the item being sold. In the online version of the problem, the learner faces a new seller and buyer at each time step, and has to post a price for each of the two parties without any knowledge of their valuations. We consider a scenario where, at each time step, before posting prices the learner observes a context vector containing information about the features of the item for sale. The valuations of both the seller and the buyer follow an unknown linear function of the context. In this setting, the learner could leverage previous transactions in an attempt to estimate private valuations. We characterize the regret regimes of different settings, taking as a baseline the best context-dependent prices in hindsight. First, in the setting in which the learner has two-bit feedback and strong budget balance constraints, we propose an algorithm with $O(\\log T)$ regret. Then, we study the same set-up with noisy valuations, providing a tight $\\widetilde O(T^{2/3})$ regret upper bound. Finally, we show that loosening budget balance constraints allows the learner to operate under more restrictive feedback. Specifically, we show how to address the one-bit, global budget balance setting through a reduction from the two-bit, strong budget balance setup. This established a fundamental trade-off between the quality of the feedback and the strictness of the budget constraints.",

                "value": "This paper tackles the bilateral trade problem in an online setting where there is an additional context present. At each time step $t$, a buyer and a seller arrive with private values $b_t$ and costs $s_t$. The algorithm must provide a pair of prices $(p,q)$ such that a sale happens if the buyer's value $b_t$ is less than $q$ and the seller's value is above $p$. The Gain from this trade assuming a sale happens is $(b_t - s_t)$.  The authors consider the problem of maximizing the gains from trade assuming either two bit feedback where we find out if $\\mathbb{1}[b_t \\leq q] $ and if $\\mathbb{1}[s_t \\geq p]$. They also consider the model where we have only one bit feedback where we know the product of these two bits of feedback. The original problem was already studied by Cesa-bianchi et al. This problem considers the setting where the buyer and seller have a hidden vector of preferences $\\theta_b, \\theta_s$ and their private values are generated from a shared context $b_t = x_t^T \\theta_b$ and $s_t = x_t^T \\theta_s$ . They consider where there may be some noise that is added as well as the budget balanced setting where the prices offered to both parties must be the same ($p=q$). \n\n\nThe main results:\n\n1) In the two feedback setting with strong budget balance $p=q$ at each time step when there is no noise in the setting. Here the authors use a natural modification of the feature based toolification.\n2) In the two bit feedback model with noise, where the noise is i.i.d coming from distributions with bounded support and densities. Finally they devise an algorithm following the explore-or-commit framework where the authors decompose the gain in terms \n3) They also study the one bit feedback problem where you only find out if a sale happens or not. To get good bounds for this model they assume they have a good regret for the strongly-balanced two bit feedback and then use that in a black box manner. However the new bounds only have a global budget balanced guarantee."

                "value": "The authors propose a very reasonable contextual model of online bilateral trade. I find the new model to be well motivated and combines two natural areas of study namely bilateral trade and online contextual regret minimization. The algorithms themselves seem interesting and are fairly natural. \n\nThe reduction from the two bit strong budget balanced case to the one bit global budget balanced case is perhaps the most interesting to me. Essentially it is a general recipe where by one can exploit explore-or-commit algorithms and perform the explorations in such a way that we can always get feedback about either the buyer or seller. However, we may lose regret compared to other party, and thus we need to ensure that there is sufficient budget to do this. This is done by measuring the average profit the 2 bit algorithm can learn and then appropriately setting the parameters to balance out the findings."

                "value": "In this paper, the authors investigate online contextual bilateral trade problem, where the valuations of two traders are modeled by different (unknown) linear functions. The authors focus on two different feedback models: (1) two-bit feedback model, where the learner can observe the binary feedback of both traders (2) one-bit feedback model, where the learner can only learns the binary information of whether the trade happens or not. For (1), the authors propose an online learning algorithm to set trading price at each round (that satisfies the strong budget balance constraint), which achieves $O(T^{2/3})$ regret. The authors also show a matching lower bound. For (2), the authors provide a reduction from one-bit feedback model to two-bit feedback model by sacrificing per-round budget balance to global budget balance and show the algorithm used in (1) can be applied to (2) and still achieves sublinear regret guarantee."

This paper considers specifically the online scenario, where at each step there is a fresh seller and buyer entering the system and the pricing decisions for both parties must be made immediately without prior knowledge of their valuations. The paper further restricts to the contextual setting where the private valuations for the seller and buyer are linearly featured by a context. A two-bid feedback is considered where for both the seller and the buyer, it can be observed whether the posed price has exceeded its value or not. By further assuming a strong budget balance between the buyer and the seller, the paper is able to derive a $O(\\log T)$ regret. Without the budget balance conditions, the paper achieves a $O(T^{2/3})$ regret, which is minimax optimal. The paper further discusses the one-bit feedback and shows the potential to obtain a sub-linear regret."
