    "title": "Secure FLOATING - Scalable Federated Learning Framework for Real-time Trust in Mobility Data using Secure Multi-Party Computation and Blockchain",
    "abstract": "The safety of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Micro-mobility devices (e-scooter, e-bikes) and  smartphone users rely on trusting the trajectory data they generate for navigation around each other. There is a need for real-time verification of mobility data from these devices without compromising privacy as malicious data used for navigation could be deadly, specially for vulnerable road users. In this paper, we propose Secure-FLOATING, a scalable framework leveraging federated learning and blockchain for nearby nodes to coordinate and learn to trust mobility data from nearby devices and store this information via consensus on a tamper-proof distributed ledger. We employ lightweight Secure Multi-party computation (SMPC) with reduced messages exchanges to preserve privacy of the users and ensure data validation in real-time. Secure-FLOATING is evaluated using realistic trajectories for up to 8,000 nodes (vehicles, micro-mobility devices and pedestrians) in New York City, and it shows to achieve lower delays and overhead, thereby accurately validating each others' mobility data in a scalable manner, with up to 75% successful endorsement for as high as 50% attacker penetration.",

                "value": "In this paper the authors envision a future traffic scenario where CAVs and other road users, can navigate in real time by sharing trajectory data. In order to ensure real-time and secure transportation, the authors propose the Secure-FLOATING framework, which utilizes federated learning and blockchain technology to ensure that nodes can learn collaboratively and trust each other's data, and reduces the amount of message exchanges by using a lightweight SMPC approach, which is demonstrated in experiments."

                "value": "There is no new theory proposed in this thesis, and the use of a lightweight model to reduce the amount of data communicated during the federated learning process is not a significant contribution. There are several problems with this thesis:\n\n1.\tThe performance gap between different prediction models is large, while the authors simply state that the performance gap between choosing different models is not large, further performance comparison results of different models under federated learning need to be provided to better validate the authors' theory. It would be more meaningful if the authors could quantify the trade-off between performance and efficiency between lightweight and complex models, such as the relationship between accuracy and time for training and inference.\n\n2.\tConsidering that the computational resources at each edge are different, the prediction model at the edge can make different prediction models according to the computational resources, which is also a more common model heterogeneity problem inside the federated learning, if this situation exists, can the Secure-FLOATING strategy work?\n\n3.\tFrom Tables 2 and 3, why is the model size and FLOPs of the RNN smaller than those of the LSTM and GRU, but the training time is longer than those of the LSTM and GRU? It is hoped that the authors will explain why this phenomenon exists and provide a detailed description of the relevant experimental implementation.\n\n4.\tDoes the Secure-FLOATING policy still work if the attackers are more than 50%? It is hoped that the authors will conduct experiments with an attacker ratio of more than 50% and report on how system performance degrades as the percentage of malicious nodes increases, and explain what are the main reasons for this phenomenon to occur.\n\n5.\tIn reality, the message size and node exchange frequency between devices are different, if relevant experimental and theoretical illustrations can be added, it will better prove the scalability of the Secure-FLOATING framework.\n\n6.\tHow does the Secure-FLOATING strategy ensure model consistency if there is node unreliability (e.g., communication delays, incomplete data, or communication outages)?"

The author mentioned that the experiment is based on a realistic dataset, but it also mentioned a situation tool SUMO to generate trajectories. So, it is unclear whether it uses real data or synthetic one. The author does not illustrate the difference between the two, i.e., why use artificial data? \n+ It will be interesting to see more detail of the experiments. For example, it is clear that the accuracy means predicting correct neighbours. However, what is the meaning of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and what is the loss function of different models(LSTM, RNN, transformer etc.). It is also worth to explore the results compared to similar freamework of federated learning or on different datasets."

                "value": "Concerns regarding the \u201cVerifiable Federated Learning global model aggregation\u201d section: The paper lacks clarity on who performs the aggregation and how the aggregated global model is obtained. It is not explicitly stated who has access to the information about the current participants in the network and why this access can be assumed. Additionally, it is unclear why the aggregation is considered to follow the predetermined algorithm. Could the aggregation process be incorrect or even malicious? The paper should also address how the number of participants or the update weights are determined in each round of federated learning. In the context of mobile networks, is there a risk of participants going offline, or of malicious nodes refusing to upload updates, which could prevent the system from proceeding to the next round?  \n\nConcerns regarding the \u201cAddition-based SMPC\u201d section: Although the authors claim that \u201cThe above toy problem uses an addition-based function, however, Secure-FLOATING will work with any function computed and matched among peers,\u201d the effectiveness of the addition-based approach is highly dependent on the aggregation method. This approach may be ineffective if the aggregation method is not linear averaged. Additionally, as the number of nodes increases, the exchange will significantly increase communication overhead. Moreover, the splitting method in SMPC may make the system more vulnerable to attacks, such as a Distributed Backdoor Attack, which relies on the coordinated efforts of multiple malicious nodes. In Secure-FLOATING\u2019s design, nodes share only part of the model updates via SMPC, and each node cannot see the complete updates from other nodes. This could allow attackers to act more covertly, making it easier for them to coordinate and inject backdoors across multiple nodes.\n\nConcerns regarding the \u201cEndorsement on Distributed Ledger\u201d section: The paper assumes a permissioned blockchain but relies on the 51% majority rule, which is typically used in permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin, under the assumption of synchronous networks. Why is the 51% assumption appropriate in this context of a permissioned blockchain? What is the expected throughput of this approach? Can it realistically meet the performance demands of a mobile network environment?\n\nConcerns regarding the experimental section: While the experiments are interesting, the experimental evaluation lacks the following key aspects:\nThe efficiency of blockchain recording and consensus mechanisms is not evaluated. The impact of adding Laplacian noise on the model\u2019s performance is not addressed.\n\nConcerns regarding writing and citations: The formatting needs to be checked to ensure compliance with the required template and font standards. Additionally, the introduction contains several claims that lack proper citations or evidence, which diminishes the overall persuasiveness of the arguments presented."
