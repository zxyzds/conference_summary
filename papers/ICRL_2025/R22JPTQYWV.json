    "title": "PointOBB-v2: Towards Simpler, Faster, and Stronger Single Point Supervised Oriented Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Single point supervised oriented object detection has gained attention and made initial progress within the community. Diverse from those approaches relying on one-shot samples or powerful pretrained models (e.g. SAM), PointOBB has shown promise due to its prior-free feature. In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v2, a simpler, faster, and stronger method to generate pseudo rotated boxes from points without relying on any other prior. Specifically, we first generate a Class Probability Map (CPM) by training the network with non-uniform positive and negative sampling. We show that the CPM is able to learn the approximate object regions and their contours. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to accurately estimate the orientation and the boundary of objects.  By further incorporating a separation mechanism, we resolve the confusion caused by the overlapping on the CPM, enabling its operation in high-density scenarios.  Extensive comparisons demonstrate that our method achieves a training speed 15.58$\\times$ faster and an accuracy improvement of 11.60\\%/25.15\\%/21.19\\% on the DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art, PointOBB. This significantly advances the cutting edge of single point supervised oriented detection in the modular track. Code and models will be released.",

                "value": "This paper improves PointOBB, an existing weakly supervised oriented object detection method. Oriented object detection is important for analyzing aerial and satellite imagery. The cost of annotation, especially when you want to draw oriented boxes, is high. This paper (and, previously, PointOBB) proposes to annotate an object with just a single point, which is an easier annotation method. The proposed method first generates a class probability map, which creates positive and negative regions. Then, a PCA based analysis is done to estimate principal axes of objects to generate rotated boxes as pseudo annotation. Authors report improved performance over PointBB on the DOTA datasets."

CPM is a simple positive/negative segmentation. PCA is PCA. \n\n(ii) The method has at least 6 thresholds: radius b1 (L244), radius b2 (L262), multiplier to radius (L254), and three others at lines 209, 307 and 320. This suggests that the method is fragile and not easily generalizable to new datasets. I believe it is the authors' responsibility to show that their method is generalizable. Yet, results are reported only on the DOTA dataset. \n\nBased on the above two points together, the paper looks more like a technical document (or patent) describing a working system, rather than an ICLR paper on representation learning. \n\nThe main claim of the paper is that they can do oriented object detection with weak supervision (single point per object). This is good but the performance (around 45)  is drastically behind the fully supervised methods (https://paperswithcode.com/sota/oriented-object-detection-on-dota-1-0), which is around high 70s. So, I think, it  is reasonable to expect a discussion on full annotation cost vs performance degradation. However, none is provided."

                "value": "## 1. Incomplete Explanation of the Class Probability Map (CPM)\n\n- While the overall pipeline of PointOBB-v2 is generally understandable from L.198-211, the crucial workings of the CPM remain unclear. \n- Specifically, key details about CPM training are omitted, including the training objective, activation function, and handling of ignored labels.\n- The current structure of the Method section adds to the confusion. Section 3.1 describes CPM generation process, followed by Section 3.2, which outlines label assignment. (The first Section 3.1 assumes that we already have the completed CPM generation model, but the readers cannot understand how it can work.)\n- Reordering these sections (such as by first describing the model training or merging both subsection) could enhance clarity.\n\n\n## 2. Limited Justification for the Effectiveness of CPM\n\n- The paper lacks convincing arguments for why the CPM functions effectively. For instance, the use of a fixed radius for positive and negative sampling lacks a clear rationale, particularly in how it helps define object contours.\n- Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provide limited insight into how the model generates a CPM with distinct object regions.\n- Figure 2, which illustrates the \u201cTraining Target\u201d and the \u201cOutput CPM\u201d, raises questions about how the model achieves such precise CPM output even when trained on such coarse training labels. Additional explanation on this discrepancy would be valuable.\n- Further clarity on Figure 2 would be beneficial: is the red dot an output from the model or a manual illustration? Similarly, the meanings of colors in Figure 3 (blue, pink, and orange) should be clarified.\n\n## 3. Generalization to Other Oriented Object Detection Scenarios\n- While the method appears well-suited for densely packed object scenarios (e.g., aerial or retail images), it\u2019s uncertain whether it generalizes to other tasks, such as text detection. Despite aiming to contribute to general object detection, the experiments are limited to remote sensing images, a subset of oriented object detection.\n\n\n## Additional Comment\n\n- The concept of CPM bears resemblance to the existing method TricubeNet [A], which, although fully supervised, also represents objects within a 2D map. A brief discussion of the similarities and distinctions between these approaches could enhance the paper\u2019s context.\n\n[A] TricubeNet: 2D Kernel-Based Object Representation for Weakly-Occluded Oriented Object Detection (WACV 2022)"

The explanation of the CPM\u2019s effectiveness is incomplete, particularly regarding how it generates clear object contours from coarse labels. While strong in experimental results, the paper would benefit from clearer methodology. \n\nMy initial rating is weak reject. I will finalize the rating after a discussion with the authors and other reviewers."
