    "title": "Towards Syn-to-Real IQA: A Novel Perspective on Reshaping Synthetic Data Distributions",
    "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, as a data-based approach, SynDR-IQA can be coupled with model-based methods without increasing inference costs.",

                "value": "1. In real-world IQA, the primary challenge in generalization is often the variety in degradation types, rather than content diversity alone. As illustrated in Figure 1, for heavily degraded images, the model tends to focus more on the degradation type. The proposed method adds more high-quality reference images but does not fundamentally address this issue.\n2. Although Figure 1 reveals some aspects of ResNet's performance, many IQA methods utilize other models, such as CLIP. Thus, the conclusions drawn in Figure 1 may not be universally applicable. A more comprehensive analysis across various models would enhance the validity of the findings.\n3. The use of a new dataset as a reference may lead to comparisons that are not entirely fair with other methods.\n4. The paper does not compare its method against some of the most recent SOTA approaches in the field, such as CLIPIQA and Q-Align. While the proposed method shows some improvements, fundamental generalization is often best achieved by exposing the model to more diverse training data, covering different degradation types, content variations, etc. Relying solely on simulated degradation effects has its limitations.\n5. The paper evaluates methods such as SR and denoising using SRCC and PLCC metrics. However, common metrics in these fields include PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, which are not compared here. Considering there may be no available reference images, non-reference metrics like MANIQA, MUSIQ, and CLIPIQA are also widely used.\n6. Only quantitative results are provided, with no visual examples. As IQA metrics often diverge significantly from human perception, presenting visualizations with corresponding scores would help illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
