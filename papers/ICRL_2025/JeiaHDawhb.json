    "abstract": "Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning, regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that, with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate how to promote simple behavior throughout the duration of the episode. To that end, we introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem, that additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories. We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy and state representation, based on a lower bound approximation. In simulated robot locomotion environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also improving performance in the original tasks.",

                "value": "The paper proposes an auxiliary RL objective, MTC, that maximizes the total correlation of states and actions under the policy. This objective encourages the policy to learn simple, consistent, and compressible behaviors that are robust to noise and dynamics shifts. Specifically, the authors assume a latent-state-conditioned policy and incentivize the policy to maximize the total correlation of latent states and actions: $\\mathcal C(z_1; a_1; \\dots; a_{T-1}; z_T)$. This objective is intractable, so they estimate a variational lowerbound $\\mathbb E_{\\pi, f} \\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \\left[\\log \\frac{q_{\\eta}(z_{t+1}|z_{1:t}, a_{1:t})}{f_{\\theta}(z_{t+1}|s_{t+1})} + \\log\\frac{q_\\chi(a_t|z_{1:t}, a_{1:t-1})}{\\pi_\\phi(a_t|s_t)}\\right]\\right]$ using a dynamics model $q_\\eta$, an action prediction model $q_\\chi$, and an encoder $f_\\theta$. The estimated lower bound is added to the reward at each timestep, with its weights dynamically adjusted via constrained optimization. Experiments show that MTC combined with SAC outperforms baselines on a suite of DM Control tasks. They further show that MTC is more robust than baselines in the presence of state and action noises and dynamics shifts."

The total correlation measures the KL divergence between the independent state and action distributions and their joint distribution. The higher the total correlation, the less it costs to compress the entire trajectory compared to compressing the states and actions independently.\n2. The authors propose a variational lower bound of the total correlation. The mathematical derivations are correct and easy to follow.\n3. The ablation experiment in Section 5.4 and Figure 4 showing improved generalization with a higher target total correlation value lends credibility to MTC's effectiveness. \n\n**List of Claims**\n\nClaim 1: the MTC objective improves RL agents' robustness to noise and distribution shifts.\n- Assumption: simplicity leads to robustness.\n- Evidence: ablation in Section 5.4 and Figure 4.\n- Statement: this ablation experiment shows that as they increase the target total correlation (the target constraint value in the constrained optimization problem), the method becomes more robust to observation and action noises and friction changes."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The fundamental motivation of the paper, \"simplicity is a powerful inductive bias\", is not well supported. The authors support it by enumerating examples in related problems, e.g. \"regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives.\" But this is quite vague. It might very well be that in RL, overoptimizing for simplicity leads to suboptimality in complex tasks. \n2. In Section 4.1, the authors motivate the use of latent states by stating that it is more robust to distractions from task-irrelevant factors (e.g. noisy TV). This claim again lacks support.\n3. The key differences between MTC and RPC [1] are (1) MTC considers states and actions while RPC only considers states, and (2) MTC conditions the dynamics and action prediction models on the history, whereas RPC only conditions on the current state. I'm not sure why (1) would conceptually improve upon RPC (see question below). (2) introduces a confounding variable that is orthogonal to the claim, since we can replace the model in RPC with a recurrent model and hope to see better performance. \n4. While the goal is to induce simplicity in the policy's behavior, the method requires learning three additional models to estimate an auxiliary objective, which is quite cumbersome. \n5. The rest of experiments are unconvincing. While the main results (Table 1) show MTC performing on par or slightly better than baselines, the improvement is not significant. Moreover, these results are in a narrow domain that prefers repetitive motion (e.g. Hopper, Cheetah, Walker are all locomotion tasks). I'm not sure if the same holds for more complex tasks. The robustness results in Figure 2 don't imply MTC being *more* robust than baselines, because SAC shows the same growth trend, just starting from a lower initial value. What I hope to see is that MTC performance degrades *at a slower rate than* SAC, instead of having a constant offset. \n\nOverall, I think this paper can be significantly strengthened by (1) grounding it in a concrete problem setting like sim2real transfer instead of a lofty desideratum (i.e. simplicity), and (2) either removing the unwarranted claims or adding experiments to support them. I strongly recommend the authors to revise and resubmit.\n\n**List of Claims (cont'd)**\n\nClaim 2: simplicity is desirable for RL.\n- Assumption: none\n- Evidence: slightly better empirical performance of MTC over baselines on DM control tasks.\n- Statement: I don't think there is enough theoretical or empirical evidence to support this claim. Given that the DM control tasks prefer periodic behavior, it might be that simplicity is particularly useful in this domain. \n\nClaim 3: using latent states results in less distraction from task-irrelevant factors.\n- Assumption: the environment consists of task-irrelevant distractors, modeling which hinder the policy's performance.\n- Evidence: none\n- Statement: to support this claim, the authors need to compare their method to a baseline that uses raw observations on environments with distractors. \n\nClaim 4: MTC improves upon RPC by considering states and actions, and conditioning the models on the history.\n- Assumption: none\n- Evidence: slightly better empirical performance than RPC.\n- Statement: I'm not sure \"why\" these changes would improve upon RPC. The sequence of states should determine the sequence of actions to a large extent. Conditioning on the history is a choice of variational approximation that can also be applied to RPC, and the paper doesn't compare to RPC + recurrent models. \n\n[1] Benjamin Eysenbach, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Sergey Levine.

                "value": "1. Why is simplicity a good inductive bias for RL? Does this inductive bias hold outside of locomotion domains where repetitive motion is preferred?\n2. Why is accounting for the states and actions better than only accounting for states as in RPC? Isn't the state trajectory a consequence of the action trajectory? \n3. In Equation 2, what does it mean to take expectation under $f$?\n4. Does the infinite horizon variant correspond to a meaningful information-theoretic objective?\n5. Can you provide more experiments to support your claims?\n    - a manipulation task where the motion is less periodic, to support the claim that simplicity is a universally desirable property.\n    - visual experiments with distractors (e.g. distracted DM control) to support the claim that latent-state policies are robust to distractors.\n    - visual robustness experiments with lighting / texture change similar to the sim2real setting, to support the claim that MTC is robust to distribution shifts."

This reward depends on the entire history of the episode through the dynamics model $q_\\mu(z_{t+1}|z_{1:t},a_{1:t})$. It should thus correctly be written $r^*(s_{a:t},a_{1:t},s_{t+1})$ and is no longer Markovian. However, this non-markovianness or its implications are not discussed anywhere. I would expect this to cause severe instabilities in training, but maybe that's not the case? At the very least this should be discussed and I would like to see some visualization of the training dynamics in the form of a training step vs reward plot. \n\n * The experimental validation is somewhat limited. Hyperparameter optimization is not performed in a structured way, both for the baselines and the proposed method. \n * The introduction motivates the method through combatting spurious correlation but there are not distractors etc. present in the experiments that could lead to spurious correlation beyond a noisy state observation. Likewise, the utilization of a learned state representation $z$ is motivated by the noisy TV problem, but this also isn't directly investigated in the experiments. \n * An ablation of only using the latent-dynamics model but not the action model would also be useful to see the contribution of the different parts of the method. This would be somewhere between the proposed method and RPC and would thus be very interesting to see.\n * This method adds additional dynamic models that are trained along with the the policy, so naturally the training time should be longer.\n\n**Structured into claims:**\n * Claim 3: The method reduces spurious correlation and focuses only task-relevant state information by using a learned state encoding. *Evidence*: Only indirect evidence is given through experiments with observation noise. I don't think this is sufficient to support the claim and experiments with explicit distractors would be more convincing.\n * Claim 4: Maximum Total Corrlation SAC as a well motivated RL method. *Evidence*: The derivation hides the non-markovianness/nonstationarity of the reward function by incorrectly listing its arguments. This is my main concern with this paper and not discussed at all. The experiments indicate that it's practically not a big issue but I would like this to be elucidated more.\n\n\n\nMinor comments:\n * Line 278: missing closing bracket for expectation\n * Line 671: $q(a_{t+1}...$ should be $q_\\mathcal{X}(a_{t+1}...$\n * It would also be nice to discuss the connection to works that directly learn periodic controllers such as [1], and maybe even the connection to periodic locomotion controllers which are popular in classical robotics.\n\n[1] Raffin, Antonin, et al. \"An Open-Loop Baseline for Reinforcement Learning Locomotion Tasks.\" RLC 2024"
