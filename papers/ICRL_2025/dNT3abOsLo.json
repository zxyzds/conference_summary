    "title": "MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks",
    "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.",

                "value": "The authors tackle the problem of crystal structure prediction (CSP) of Metal-Organic Frameworks. Typically, CSP is performed using ab initio calculations using density functional theory (DFT). However, DFT is computationally expensive and scales poorly for large complex systems such as MOFs. MOFFLow presents a MOF-specific generative model for CSP that operates on secondary building units rather than isolated atoms for structure prediction."

MOFFlow treats the MOF building blocks (Metal nodes, organic links) as frames, and generates the 3D crystal structure by modeling the orientation and translation of the building blocks separately. A novel MOFAttention module is also introduced to model the hierarchical structure of MOFs. MOFFlow is benchmarked against DiffCSP, random structure search, and evolutionary algorithm baselines. The paper shows a significant improvement compared with DiffCSP in generating MOF structure, demonstrating the advantage of the hierarchical modeling approach in generating large MOF structures containing hundreds of atoms."

From DiffCSP to MOFFlow, there are many changes: 1) the adoption of a hierarchical modeling approach; 2) change from diffusion to flow matching; 3) change of the architecture of the score network.

Such an analysis would strengthen the understanding of the contributions of each module.\n3. While MOFFLOW is stated to be computationally efficient compared to baseline methods, a more detailed analysis of its training and inference costs relative to comparable models would help contextualize its practical deployment feasibility.\n4. (Minor point) The paper mainly focuses on properties relevant to structure prediction accuracy (e.g., match rate and RMSE).

However, constructing mean-free or center-of-mass (CoM) free systems for periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) differs from non-periodic systems [3] and warrants further discussion.\n- The backbone model is based on a Cartesian coordinate system, which necessitates careful design of edge connections to capture intra-cell interactions.\n\n2.
