    "title": "Inverse decision-making using neural amortized Bayesian actors",
    "abstract": "Bayesian observer and actor models have provided normative explanations for many behavioral phenomena in perception, sensorimotor control, and other areas of cognitive science and neuroscience. They attribute behavioral variability and biases to interpretable entities such as perceptual and motor uncertainty, prior beliefs, and behavioral costs. However, when extending these models to more naturalistic tasks with continuous actions, solving the Bayesian decision-making problem is often analytically intractable. Inverse decision-making, i.e. performing inference over the parameters of such models given behavioral data, is computationally even more difficult. Therefore, researchers typically constrain their models to easily tractable components, such as Gaussian distributions or quadratic cost functions, or resort to numerical approximations. To overcome these limitations, we amortize the Bayesian actor using a neural network trained on a wide range of parameter settings in an unsupervised fashion. Using the pre-trained neural network enables performing efficient gradient-based Bayesian inference of the Bayesian actor model's parameters. We show on synthetic data that the inferred posterior distributions are in close alignment with those obtained using analytical solutions where they exist. Where no analytical solution is available, we recover posterior distributions close to the ground truth. We then show how our method allows for principled model comparison and how it can be used to disentangle factors that may lead to unidentifiabilities between priors and costs. Finally, we apply our method to empirical data from three sensorimotor tasks and compare model fits with different cost functions to show that it can explain individuals' behavioral patterns.",

                "value": "This paper introduces a method for performing Bayesian inference on the parameters of Bayesian observer-actor models, particularly suited for scenarios where Bayesian decision-making can be computationally intractable. The approach leverages a neural network to amortize the decision-making process of the subject by training the network to minimize the expected task-relevant cost with respect to the posterior over latent states and the action distribution. This setup allows for efficient, gradient-based inference of parameters from behavioral data. The authors validate their approach on synthetic data, highlighting its effectiveness and also discuss identifiability issues with recommendations to mitigate them. They further illustrate the method's applicability to human behavioral data."

                "value": "In this work, the proposed approach aims to infer what a subject\u2019s decisions were optimal for. However, there is still an assumption of optimal behavior, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios. Factors such as suboptimal learning or changing task demands can lead to deviations from optimality. Even if these deviations could potentially be reframed as an alternative optimality criterion, doing so would introduce additional identifiability challenges. It would be beneficial  to discuss the limitations of this assumption.\n\nAnother potential limitation is that the use of the reparameterization trick requires a specific form of action distribution, which may restrict the model\u2019s adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks where this distributional form does not apply.\n\nFinally, the presentation could be improved. Several figures lack clear labels and legends, making them difficult to interpret, and acronyms are introduced without prior definition. A revised presentation with attention to these details would enhance the paper."
