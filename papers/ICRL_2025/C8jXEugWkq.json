    "title": "EqNIO: Subequivariant Neural Inertial Odometry",
    "abstract": "Neural network-based odometry using accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a single IMU can achieve robust, and low-drift localization capabilities, through the use of _neural displacement priors_. These priors learn to produce denoised displacement measurements but need to ignore data variations due to specific IMU mount orientation and motion directions, hindering generalization.\nThis work introduces EqNIO, which addresses this challenge with _canonical displacement priors_. We train an off-the-shelf architecture with IMU measurements that are mapped into a canonical gravity-aligned frame with learnable yaw. The outputs (displacement and covariance) are mapped back to the original frame. To maximize generalization, we find that these learnable yaw frames must transform equivariantly with global trajectory rotations and reflections across the gravity direction, _i.e._ action by the roto-reflection group $O_g(3)$ which preserves gravity (a subgroup of $O(3)$). This renders the displacement prior $O(3)$ _subequivariant_.\nWe tailor specific linear, convolutional and non-linear layers that commute with the actions of the group. \nMoreover, we introduce a bijective decomposition of angular rates into vectors that transform similarly to accelerations, allowing us to leverage both measurements types. Natively, angular rates would need to be inverted upon reflection, unlike acceleration, which hinders their joint processing.\nWe highlight EqNIO's flexibility and generalization capabilities by applying it to both filter-based (TLIO), and end-to-end (RONIN) architectures, and outperforming existing methods that use _soft_ equivariance from auxiliary losses or data augmentation on the TLIO, Aria, RONIN, RIDI and OxIOD datasets. We believe this work paves the way to low-drift, and generalizable neural inertial odometry on edge-devices.",

                "value": "The authors propose a method to adapt existing inertial odometry (IO) architectures to be invariant to the IMU orientation. This is done by making use of an $O_g(3)$/$SO_g(3)$ equivariant network that transforms the gravity-aligned IMU measurements to a canonical frame as a pre-processing step for non-equivariant IO. The predicted displacement and covariance from IO for these canonicalized measurements are then transformed back to the source frame using the inverse canonical frame. The proposed method leads to improved accuracy while maintaining comparable runtime and can in principle be applied to any IO method."

The canonicalization approach is a good choice for this problem as it adapts existing sota IO architectures and keeps the pipeline interpretable.\n- The symmetry of the problem in terms of $O_g(3)$ equivariance (which is $O(3)$ subequivariant) is well presented. Care has been taken to consistently process the IMU measurements and specialized $O(2)$/$SO(2)$ architectures based on vector neurons have been developed, while more architectures are possible.\n- The approach was tested on two IO architectures which showed accuracy improvements on many datasets, with comprehensive ablation studies, while keeping the inference times comparable."

From the definitions in A.5 (I believe squared norm is missing), it seems that MSE is just sqrt(ATE)? But the numbers don't reflect this. And I also think ATE, RTE, AYE would be sufficient. Do you do SE3 alignment with the GT trajectories?\n\nMinor non-critical comments:\n- Could you elaborate on the yaw augmentation procedure used for TLIO / RoNIN?\n- It is surprising to me that despite requiring 10x more FLOPs than the non-equiv. architectures, there is barely any increase in runtime (<1 ms). Since there is no code release, can you comment more on the reasons for this efficiency?\n- Writing: In Fig. 3b it is not clear what 'rot. sense' means; explain how the frame is constructed from the network outputs with gs-orth. for sake of clarity; Typo in conclusion: \"respects eliminates\"; Would be helpful to indicate that * means no-EKF in the table 2,3 captions or simply remove the * since it is not applicable to RoNIN."

Several contributions are presented. A canonicalization scheme is presented, that maps IMU measurements into a canonical orientation. A processing step is devised, which map both accelerometer and gyro readings into a space where gravity direction is preserved.
