    "abstract": "Social Media Popularity Prediction (SMPP) is the task of forecasting the level of engagement a social media post will receive. It is crucial\nfor understanding audience engagement and enabling targeted marketing strategies. However, the inherent imbalance in real-world\nsocial media data, where certain popularity levels are underrepresented, poses a significant challenge. In this study, we leveraged the\nrecent success of contrastive learning and its growing integration into regression tasks by introducing a Weighted-Rank CR loss to\naddress the data imbalance challenges. Experiments on the Social Media Prediction Dataset demonstrated that our method outperformed\nthe vanilla approach and the current state-of-the-art contrastive regression approach Rank-N-Contrast.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel method for Social Media Popularity Prediction (SMPP) using a technique called Weighted-Rank Contrastive Regression , aiming to address data imbalance issues in popularity prediction tasks. Building on the Rank-N-Contrast method, the authors introduce a weighting mechanism that considers the label distance between samples, enhancing the contrastive learning process by differentiating the importance of negative pairs based on popularity differences. Extensive experiments conducted on the Social Media Prediction Dataset (SMPD) and selected datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, particularly in scenarios with skewed and imbalanced popularity scores."

Distance weighting has been developed extensively in the field of machine learning, and this method merely adds distance weighting to an existing approach, which is not novel.\n2. The paper uses a large dataset, SMPD, and creates two subsets with more imbalanced distributions through sampling. However, there is only one actual dataset, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the method's effectiveness.\n3. The dependence of the method on the weighting factor alpha has not been studied.\n4. The paper lacks an analysis of why an exponential weighting strategy was used instead of other weighting mechanisms, or how it interacts with different data characteristics. This omission makes it difficult to assess the model's adaptability to other weighting mechanisms or data distributions."

Most of the space of the article is spent on other methods, while the proposed method\u2019s introduction focuses on only one weight coefficient (Equation 4 and Table 1). At the same time, there is a big difference between Table 1\u2019s result and Table 3\u2019s result, it is difficult to convince that the weight coefficient (Equation 4) plays a positive effect in the whole framework. The authors should add ablation studies to convince the positive effect of the weight coefficient (Equation 4).\n3.\tThe authors\u2019 contributions seem to be too little.

At the same time, I doubt the generalization of the Weighting Strategy (Table 1), is the coefficient effective and universal on other methods and other datasets?\n4.\tThe design of the proposed weights seem not relative to the specific task.

Advances in neural information processing systems, 2020, 33: 21798-21809.), the paper is of limited innovation. The article seems to be just a small improvement or trick for contrastive loss in the context of unbalanced regression, where hard negative samples in contrastive learning are going to improve the final result unquestionably. The authors' approach is viewed as explicitly highlighting hard negative samples using a simple weighting method in the paper formulation, and the authors in the article do not give the way of selecting the positive and negative samples.\n2.
