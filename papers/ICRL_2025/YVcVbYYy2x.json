    "title": "Adaptive Tool Use in Large Language Models with Meta-Cognition Trigger",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities, reshaping the landscape of functional tasks by leveraging external tools to tackle complex problems, such as those requiring real-time data or specialized input/output processing. Existing research primarily focuses on equipping LLMs with a broader array of diverse external tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, weather/map applications) but overlooks the necessity of tool usage, invoking external tools indiscriminately without assessing their actual need. This naive strategy leads to two significant issues: 1) increased latency due to prolonged processing times, and 2) potential errors arising from communication between LLMs and external tools, resulting in faulty outputs. In this paper, we introduce a concept we term meta-cognition as a proxy for LLM self-capability, and we propose an adaptive decision-making strategy for invoking external tools, referred to as MeCo. Specifically, MeCo focuses on representation space to capture emergent representations of high-level cognitive phenomena that quantify the LLM's meta-cognitive scores, thereby guiding decisions on when to use external tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free, incurring minimal cost, and our experiments demonstrate that MeCo accurately detects the model's internal cognitive signals. More importantly, our approach significantly enhances decision-making accuracy in tool use for multiple base models across various benchmarks.",

Current approaches tend to call tools indiscriminately, leading to increased latency and errors. The authors propose MeCo, which uses representation engineering (RepE) to detect \"meta-cognition\" signals that indicate whether a model needs external tools."

While the authors frame this as detecting \"meta-cognition\", it's functionally very similar to previous work on detecting other concepts like honesty or confidence. The main innovation seems to be in the framing rather than the technical approach. \n\nThe decision mechanism is overly simplistic, using basic thresholds on the meta-cognition scores without any principled way to set these thresholds. There's no consideration of different tools having different costs or risks, or of the model's confidence in its decisions--which seems quite relevant here."

However, the extensive use of meta-cognition in the article confuses this point. \nA more detailed definition of Meta-cognition should be put it in a more prominent position. And it would be better if you could provide examples and quantitative indicators.\n\n## 2. The proposed method has limited effectiveness\nTable 1 shows that the score improvement brought by fine-tuning is much greater than the method proposed in the paper. Especially on the fine-tuned model, the improvement brought by the proposed method is limited.\n\nAlthough this method does not require fine-tuning, it does require obtaining the output of the intermediate layer of the model to train the probe. The paper does not compare the overhead of fine-tuning and training probes\nIn addition, the intermediate layer output is also necessary during inference, which will continue to incur additional overhead.\nThis results in the actual cost being no lower than fine-tune.\n\n## 3. Insufficient experiments\nOnly the 7B scale model was tested. The effects on larger models (e.g. 70B) need to be supplemented. \nAnd it is unreasonable to use only the first token of the model to judge correctness, especially for a 7B scale model.\n\nIn addition, I have doubts about the prompt in Appendix B.1.\n> \u201cOur findings indicate that instructing the model to first provide a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d response followed by an explanation yields better results than other strategies, including the CoT approach.\u201d\n\nWhen using the COT method, if still let the model answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d first and explain it later, then COT will not produce any effect, because the \"Yes\" or \"No\" is not based on the explanation, which is a classic incorrect use of COT.
