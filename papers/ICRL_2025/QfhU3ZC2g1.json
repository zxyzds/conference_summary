    "title": "Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression",
    "abstract": "We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares (2SLS) solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the 2SLS method, in the presence of endogeneity.",

Could the authors provide insights or guidelines on choosing these parameters for optimal performance?\n\n(3) How sensitive is the model to changes in the strength of endogeneity? While the experiments demonstrate robustness to varying IV strengths, it would be valuable to understand if there is a threshold or particular cases where the transformer\u2019s performance degrades.
