    "title": "Bandit Learning in Matching Markets with Indifference",
    "abstract": "A rich line of recent works studies how participants in matching markets learn their unknown preferences through iterative interactions with each other. Two sides of participants in the market can be respectively formulated as players and arms in the bandit problem. To ensure market stability, the objective is to minimize the stable regret of each player. Though existing works provide significant theoretical upper bounds for players' stable regret, the results heavily rely on the assumption that each participant has a strict preference ranking. However, in real applications, multiple candidates (e.g., workers in the labor market and students in school admission) usually demonstrate comparable performance levels, making it challenging for participants (e.g. employers and schools) to differentiate and rank their preferences. To deal with the potential indifferent preferences, we propose an adaptive exploration algorithm based on arm-guided Gale-Shapley (AE-AGS). We show that its stable regret is of order $O(NK \\log T / \\Delta^2)$, where $N$ is the number of players, $K$ the number of arms, $T$ the total time horizon, and $\\Delta$ the minimum non-zero preference gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial regret bound applicable to the more general indifference setting, and it is only $O(N)$ worse than the state-of-the-art result in the strict preference setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in handling such complex situations and its consistent superiority over baselines.",

                "value": "The paper is a contribution that falls under the line of works where the goal is to match participants in a market when the preferences of these participants is not known apriori. While previous works, which the paper lists, have proposed algorithms to solve this problem for the setting where each participant in the market has a strict preference order, this work proposes an approach called AE-AGS that also accounts for the case of indifferent preferences. Indifferent preference is the case when a market participant (player or bandit arm) has an equal preference among one or more options from its complementing partner. \n\nThe indifferent preference scenario is critical for real-world applications since often it is not practical or even reasonable for a market player to create a strict preference ranking order over its complementary market participant. For example, a company might be indifferent towards hiring one among a collection of equally qualified employees. \n\nThe work proposes the AE-AGS algorithm for the centralized and de-centralized with communication settings. They analyze the algorithm and provide an upper bound on stable regret for both these settings. Finally experiments are conducted to compare the approach to baselines from the literature, and establish superior performance especially in the case of preference indifference."

                "value": "1. There appears to be some inconsistency between the message of Table 1 classifying prior work, and section 2 on related work. While the table suggests that there have been prior works (Liu et al. 2020 and Basu et al. 2021) that address the preference indifference setting however there is a line towards the end of para 2 in Section 2 that reads: \"In all the above works, both players and arms are assumed to have a strict preference ranking ... \".\n\nPlease clarify whether Liu et al. 2020 and Basu et al. 2021 can indeed handle preference indifference, and if so, how your approach differs from or improves upon these prior works. This would help resolve the apparent contradiction between Table 1 and the statement in Section 2.\n\n2. Seems to me that the definition of Stable Regret in Eqn 1 needs to be motivated better. In particular, why is stable regret bench marked against the least reward that could be obtained from a stable matching and not the maximum stable matching reward? Please provide a justification for why you chose the least reward from a stable matching as the benchmark, rather than the maximum. Additionally, please discuss the implications of this choice on your results and how the results would compare with those under alternative definitions of stable regret.\n\n3. Please increase the font size of the legend text in Figure 1 to improve readability for printed versions.\n\n4. Please provide a clear definition of \"Cumulative Market Instability\" and explain how it relates to stable regret.\n\n5. Please clarify why enumerating all stable matchings is problematic, even for small toy problems. Also consider including results using stable regret for these smaller examples if feasible."

This way the user don't suffer from the dilemma of whether to declare two arms tied or continuing the exploration. Instead, the user requires only segregate non-tied arm through pairwise computations. This ensures even if ties are present a stable match is discovered with logarithmic regret."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The formulation of the problem setting is not convincing enough. For matching markets with ties, there are notions of weak stability, strong stability, and super stability [1], while the authors focus on weak stability without sufficient discussions. In the example 3.1, both (weakly) stable matchings (line 221, 222) are pareto efficient matchings in the sense that no other (weakly) stable matching can pareto dominate the matching for players. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that no player-optimal stable matching exists in this sense. Finally, the definition of regret compares the difference with $m_i$, which is defined as the worst partner among all weakly stable matchings. By the definition,  {i, m_i} is not a stable matching since the worst partner might be in different matchings. I feel it might be better to define the collective stable regrets instead of individual stable regrets.\n\nI am also concerned with the algorithmic novelty in the paper. The AE-AGS algorithm looks like a simple (not necessarily trivial) generalization of ODA algorithm [2] and the AE arm-DA algorithm [3]. These algorithms utilize arm-guided Gale-Shapley to find stable matchings and utilize UCB structure to eliminate sub-optimal arms. From my understanding, the algorithmic difference in AE-AGS is that players do not need to eliminate an arm if there are ties while still proceeding with the arm-guided Gale-Shapley. Also, the analysis and proof also look similar to [2].\n\n[1] Robert W Irving. Stable marriage and indifference. Discrete Applied Mathematics.\n[2] Fang Kong and Shuai Li.
