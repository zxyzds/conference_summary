    "title": "BiDRN: Binarized 3D Whole-body Human Mesh Recovery",
    "abstract": "3D whole-body human mesh recovery aims to reconstruct the 3D human body, face, and hands from a single image. Although powerful deep learning models have achieved accurate estimation in this task, they require enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited edge devices. In this work, we propose a Binarized Dual Residual Network (BiDRN), a novel quantization method designed to estimate the 3D human body, face, and hands parameters efficiently. Specifically, we design a basic unit Binarized Dual Residual Block (BiDRB) composed of Local Convolution Residual (LCR) and Block Residual (BR), which can preserve as much full-precision information as possible. For LCR, we further generalize it to four kinds of convolutional modules so that full-precision information can be propagated even across mismatched dimensions when reshaping features. Additionally, we also binarize the face and hands box-prediction network as Binarized BoxNet, which further reduces the model redundancy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiDRN, which has a significant improvement over state-of-the-art binarization algorithms. Moreover, our BiDRN achieves comparable performance with the full-precision method Hand4Whole while using only **22.1%** parameters and **14.8%** operations. We will release all the code and pretrained models.",

The main design in the proposed Binarized\nDual Residual Network (BiDRN) is the Binarized Dual Residual Block (BiDRB), which is further composed of Local Convolution Residual (LCR) and Block Residual (BR). The LCR is extended to convolution operations with down scale, down sample, fusion up, and fusion down. The design of LCR includes using Hardtanh as pre-activation function and the adoption of RPReLU activation. Experiments are conducted on two datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other binarization methods."

How does it differ from a grouped binarized convolution (i.e., with 2 groups)? As for the FullPrecision convolution in the block residual, its kernel size and stride are 1 and 2, respectively. Will this result in checkboard artifacts? \n\n\\- None of the competitors is designed for human mesh recovery.
