    "abstract": "Accurate control of quantum states is crucial  for quantum computing and other quantum technologies. In the basic scenario, the task is  to steer a quantum system towards a target state through  a sequence of control operations. Determining the appropriate operations, however, generally requires  information about the initial state of the system. Gathering this information becomes increasingly challenging when   the initial state is not {\\em a priori} known and the system's size grows large. To address this problem, we develop a machine-learning algorithm that uses a small amount of measurement data to  construct its internal representation of the system's state. The algorithm  compares this data-driven representation with a  representation of the target state, and uses reinforcement learning to output the appropriate control operations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm showing that it achieves accurate control of unknown many-body quantum states and non-Gaussian continuous-variable states using data from  a limited set of  quantum measurements.",

Regarding the empirical results, I am missing details on the training process, comparisons to considerable baselines, and, in general, quantitative results.

Those two sections should be consolidated. Also the reward in 3.1 is introduced first by the simple negative euclidian distance, but the EQ uses a different norm ||.||(_2?) and divides by d. This should be more consistent.\n- Its not clear if the architectures in Figure 2 are part of the contribution? As I understand, Figure 2 is simply an illustration of representation network and decoders of Wu et al. 2023b?\n- Figures 3 d/e, 6 and 7 are way too small to read, even with full digital zoom. Most of the explanation focus on Figure 3, with Figures 4-6 only barely mentioned in L350-354. Even with the caption, I am not sure I understand what is meant to be conveyed with Figure 7.\n- Novelty in this work is rather lacking, in my opinion. This is a simple application of RL to a discrete control problem with a very simple reward function. The representation network is an interesting inclusion, but similarly also only an application of existing work. The choice of designs (decoder architecture, RL algorithm choice, hyperparameters etc.) are not motivated, although part of this information can be found in the appendix. (Still papers should be self-contained without the appendix.)\n- Finally there is no comparison to other approaches included in this paper and as such significance is hard to judge. Without context, or at least an ablation study of different choices for the chosen approach the contribution of this paper is very light.\n\n---\n\nMinor Notes:\n\n- Figure 1 does not really present any valuable insights than one line of text would not also have explained.\n- L154, 158 i.e.[,]\n- L 157 non[]Gaussian\n- L 182 unclosed bracket and whitespace ([]from a finite set \u2026\n- The notation of bold-r for representations and default r for reward could be chosen better and are confusing at times.\n- The notation of maximizing the average cumulative reward is worded badly. In any RL setting, the RL agents learns to optimize a policy that maximizes the reward / return of each episode. Improvement of average return over time is simply a side-effect of this.\n- Inconsistent use of Fig. and Figure. for references.\n- L 327, 329 [Ref.] {citation} ?\n- The color palette in Fig.3 d/e could be better chosen and the figures should be bigger. The light blue/beige colors and the trajectory, at that small scale, are very hard to see.\n- L 371 overloads the variable \u201cr\u201d for the third time."

As such I find it difficult to reason about the complexity of this task by the t-sne control trajectory, could you please elaborate a bit more on this?\n- Is there a reason as to why Figure 3 only shows 30 steps? Does the algorithm perform better / finds the target state eventually, or are the 30 steps a physical hard-constraint? (Figures 7 are plotted up to 55 control steps?)\n- In Figure 3a, the no-label case for Tr\u2192SB is very much an outlier, performance wise. Is there a reason for this?"

This article proposed a new reinforcement learning method termed RGRL. It is built on two previous works [Zhu et al (2022) and Wu et al.

In every control step, one would translate measurement statistics into such a representation and decide on the next step base on that information.

The authors then show how reinforcement learning can be used to apply adequate control operations to realise a desired target state representation.  The control actions are determined by a neural network based on measurement data from a set of quantum measurements. This builds upon previous work  (Yan Zhu, Ya-Dong Wu, Ge Bai, Dong-Sheng Wang, Yuexuan Wang, and Giulio Chiribella. Flexible learning of quantum states with generative query neural networks. Nat. Commun., 13(1):6222, 2022.) which described a method of generating representations of quantum states but the novelty lies in the reinforcement learning algorithm.\n\nThis particular approach is applied to two systems of interest. First the authors show that they can effectively control many body ground states and realise desired phase transitions. Two different state representations; one for predicting measurement statistics and one for predicting mutual information are explicitly compared and it is shown that higher quality state representations yield better control efficiency. Lastly, the authors consider a control task where they prepare a target output state from a CV Kerr quantum gate."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There are a number of issues with this paper which I would like to address. \n\nFirstly, it seems as though it lacks the significance for it to be relevant to the wider audience of ICLR. The algorithm described in the paper seems interesting, but it is not clear that it is solving a broadly relevant and useful problem. The method is applicable particularly to systems where the initial states of the system are completely unknown, however no concrete examples of important and relevant physical systems which exhibit this behaviour are shown or described. Similarly, in the case of the CV Kerr gate, it is not clear what physically motivates the experimental setup: where a \"target output state can be obtained by applying the unknown quantum process to a certain input state\". It would be helpful to frame this more clearly with explicit references.\n\nSecondly, It is not clear to what extent the algorithm is practically useful when sampling from a real quantum device, since \"M\" copies of the same quantum state need to be prepared (what about the no cloning theorem?). Claims in the paper are made that the number of measurement samples is \"small\". It would be useful to have a quantitative comparison of sample efficiency compared to other methods, and to discuss how the approach handles the constraints of real quantum devices, including preparation and measurement times. For example, the authors could look at the following reference: Irtaza Khalid, Carrie A. Weidner, Edmond A. Jonckheere, Sophie G. Schirmer, and Frank C. Langbein Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043002 which constructs a sample efficient RL algorithm for quantum control.\n\nThirdly, there are no benchmarks or comparisons drawn to previous work in the quantum control literature. From the presentation in the paper, it is not clear whether the method outperforms previous methods or approaches in any relevant quantum control tasks. Moreover, the authors claim their algorithm is \"scaleable\", but it is not clear what makes the method scaleable and there are no explicit benchmarks. There are some alternatives in the literature which could be compared and contrasted; for example given uncertainty about the initial state, one can incorporate this into the design of a particular quantum control sequence which does not require a \"black-box treatment\" as shown in (Frank Sch\u00e4fer et al 2020 Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. 1 035009) where the authors claim that \"Despite the uncertainty in the initial states, we managed to reach fidelities larger than 99.9% in the preparation of a GHZ state in a chain of M qubits.\" It is also unclear whether one would opt for a \"black-box\" method when the initial state is unknown in a real physical system, as often a more efficient approach in real quantum experiments would be to bring the quantum state into a known quantum state to then perform a control operation (e.g. optical pumping in atoms or transmon reset). \n\nLastly, the manuscript is not always clear and some of the experimental results are inaccessible to a non-specialist audience and I suspect the broad audience of ICLR. The Kerr gate is mentioned but no citation is given for further details and it is not clear why this is a particularly important problem to tackle which should be explained. Moreover, the control of many body quantum states is not sufficiently contextualised or motivated. The in-depth discussion of different types of phase transitions as well as Figs 3/6 showing \"representation space\" are not clear (no axes labels). The \"t-SNE algorithm\" is also left unexplained with no citation and it would be good to better explain this for a reader with an ML background or cut down on specific details on the phase transitions. Some more explicit references need to be made to the Appendix sections to clearly guide the reader for further background/implementation details."

You claim that \"This approach significantly reduces the reliance on precise initial state information, making the algorithm scaleable and applicable to larger quantum systems\". How does the algorithm scale with quantum system size and what makes it scaleable?\n\nHow many measurements are needed and how does this scale with representation quality? How does this compare with other black box approaches in terms of the number of required samples?
