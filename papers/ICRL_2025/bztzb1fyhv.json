    "title": "Learning Differential Pyramid Representation for Tone Mapping",
    "abstract": "To display high dynamic range (HDR) images on low dynamic range (LDR) screens, tone mapping operations (TMO) are required to compress the dynamic range. Recently, the deep learning-based TMO methods with 3D Look-Up Table (LUT) have shown promising performance. However, these methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results in local areas, and generating image-level TMO on down-sampled low-resolution images leads to loss of details. To overcome this problem, we propose to construct a learnable differential pyramid representation network, termed DPRNet, for joint global and local tone mapping. Specifically, we construct multi-layer perceptrons to globally modulate the tones in pixel-level. Then, we propose a local 3D LUT, which generates the TMO coefficients in patch-level. To further enhance the details, we propose a learnable differential pyramid to capture multi-scale high-frequency components, coupled with an iterative mask learning strategy to refine high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 2.58 dB in the HDR+ dataset and 3.31 dB in the HDRI Haven dataset respectively compared with the second best method. In addition, our method has the best generalization ability in unsupervised video TMO. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxx2024.github.io/DPRNet/ .",

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel Differential Pyramid Representation Network (DPRNet) designed for tone mapping high dynamic range (HDR) images to low dynamic range (LDR) outputs. DPRNet introduces a hybrid approach that combines global and local tone mapping modules with a Learnable Differential Pyramid (LDP) module, which helps capture multi-scale high-frequency details. The network\u2019s architecture is organized into Global Tone Perception (GTP) for consistent luminance adjustments, Local Tone Tuning (LTT) for enhanced regional contrast, and Iterative Detail Enhancement for restoring finer details. The authors claim that DPRNet achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets like HDR+ and HDRI Haven, with extensive experiments, visual comparisons, and ablation studies supporting their claims."

                "value": "Innovation: The paper presents a novel solution that successfully integrates global and local tone mapping, tackling common HDR-to-LDR conversion challenges by balancing global consistency and local detail. \n\nMethod: DPRNet\u2019s architecture, particularly the LDP and iterative enhancement modules, effectively preserves high-frequency details. This is a significant advantage over traditional tone mapping, which often struggles with fine textures. \n\nEvaluation: The authors present robust quantitative improvements across various image quality metrics, including PSNR and SSIM. Qualitative comparisons and user studies further underscore DPRNet\u2019s advantages in detail retention and aesthetic quality. Testing across multiple datasets (HDR+, HDRI Haven, HDR Survey, and UVTM video) demonstrates strong generalization, a critical factor for practical HDR applications."

                "value": "Computational Complexity: While effective, DPRNet is computationally intensive, particularly with high-resolution images. The paper\u2019s discussion of runtime and computational load is limited, which might impact its scalability for real-time or mobile applications. \n\nLimited Benchmark Comparison: Although the authors provide comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods, some relevant techniques are omitted, particularly those with similar high-frequency-focused approaches (e.g., S. Moran et al., \u2018\u2018CURL: Neural curve layers for global image enhancement,\u2019\u2019 in ICPR, 2021 and L. Zhao et al., \"Learning Tone Curves for Local Image Enhancement,\" in IEEE Access, 2022). \n\nGeneralization on Noisy Datasets: DPRNet struggles on datasets like MIT FiveK due to noise and overexposure, as noted by the authors. The paper could benefit from discussing potential solutions or additional noise-handling components. \n\nUser Study: While a user study is included, the scope could be broader to include users with different levels of experience in HDR processing, providing a more diverse evaluation of perceived quality."
