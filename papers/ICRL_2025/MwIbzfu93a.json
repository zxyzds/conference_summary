    "title": "TIM: Interpretable Modelling of Complex Temporal Interactions in Multivariate Networks",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across various fields and essential for addressing numerous real-world challenges. However, existing forecasting methods have significant limitations: while Transformer models are effective, they are constrained by high computational costs and declining performance in long-term forecasting; MLP models struggle to capture complex multivariate interactions. These issues hinder the models' ability to accurately decompose seasonality and trends. To tackle these problems, we propose a new method called TIM. Through a cross-layer architecture, TIM decomposes time series predictions into temporal features, multivariate interaction features, and residual components. Our all-MLP model integrates global features with complex multivariate dynamics. By introducing a linear self-attention mechanism across variables and time steps, TIM enhances the learning of feature interactions and accurately captures temporal transitions between domains. This innovative design leverages linear attention mechanisms and cross-layer architecture to more effectively model temporal features and multivariate interactions. It surpasses traditional Transformer-based methods by improving predictive accuracy while maintaining linear computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TIM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while ensuring computational efficiency.",

In my view the computational complexity analysis is needed as it's helpful for people to understand why the proposed model should be more efficient. Also, by having the complexity analysis, we can better understand in what scenarios, the model should perform faster than others. To me, I did not understand where the better efficiency comes from. \n2. The experiments seem not very sufficient. The paper only includes 7 baselines. I feel a few more baselines should be compared. For example, another category of models TCN-based models such as ModernTCN [1].\n\nReference:\n\n[1] ModernTCN: A Modern Pure Convolution Structure for General Time Series Analysis. ICLR 2024"

                "value": "1. I am a bit confused that why the authors claimed that the model is all-MLP but still has a linear self-attention mechanism? If Line 7 of Algo 1 is referred to as the linear self-attention, it should probably be explicitly explained more. \n2. I don't fully understand Algorithm 1, especially the part of residual and its relationship with y. Based on Line 3 and 4, $res = \\hat W_i(X_i - W_iX_i - b_1) + b_2$. Then, because $W_i and \\hat W_i$,  $b$ are learnable, residual can be rewritten as a new linear projection without dependence on $y$. If so, what is the propose of using $x_{cat} = cat(y,res)$? What would happen if we do not use the residual within the fusion architecture?"

Firstly, the article's title emphasizes interpretability, but the entire paper discusses interpretability very little.\nI understand that the components of the framework in the paper seem to be designed for interdependency or interactions, the authors need to clearly state what they have interpreted. A more explicit discussion is needed to discuss interaction -> interpretability.\n\nAmong the many models in time series, one often either optimizes performance or interpretability. The authors' approach of titling with interpretability but emphasizing prediction error throughout the paper confuses me. The paper does not compare with other time series interpretability articles within the related work section.\n\nThere are some other minor concepts that I think should be discussed in the article. They are listed in the 'Questions' part."

Could you clarify how interpretability is integrated within the TIM model?  Does the model offer insights into specific feature interactions or temporal dependencies?\n\n2. There is considerable discussion about the attention mechanism, including Equation (1), which might cover too much conventional knowledge. Could some of this space be repurposed to focus on the novel contributions and unique aspects of the proposed model?\n\n3. The paper suggests advantages for long-term time series but does not provide a specific validation for this claim. Would performance improve with increasing sequence length, and could this be demonstrated to highlight the model's strength in handling longer sequences?\n\n4. The linear attention mechanism\u2019s computational advantages are discussed, yet its theoretical justification, especially in terms of time complexity, could be elaborated upon."

While TIM demonstrates strong performance, there is room for improvement in capturing more complex multivariate relationships, especially in datasets with numerous variables and long time series.

For example, Feat plays a more important role in ETTm2, electricity, and traffic, which hasn't been fully and clearly explained in the paper.\n\n2. The meaning of each module is well illustrated in the paper. But in Algorithm2 and Figure2, it's demonstrated that these three modules show a certain degree of sequential dependency. Is there any chance that a slight change in module order would drastically affect the results? This calls for a detailed illustration of the sequential design of these three modules."
