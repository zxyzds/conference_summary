    "title": "Understanding the learned look-ahead behavior of chess neural networks",
    "abstract": "We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. by analyzing the model's ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network's look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains. Our work also showcases the effectiveness of interpretability techniques in uncovering cognitive-like processes in artificial intelligence systems.",

                "value": "Building upon the previous work of Jenner et al., 2024, this study expands the analysis to examine evidence of learned look-ahead in a powerful chess-playing network. While the original work demonstrated look-ahead capabilities of 1 and 3 moves, this study extends the analysis to consider look-ahead depths of 5 and 7 moves. Additionally, the study presents evidence suggesting that the model can consider multiple lines of move sequences."

For instance, the previous work introduced the idea of using a smaller model to filter positions, a bilinear probe design, finding L12H12, and more.\n- The claim about the model considering alternative sequences of moves is not convincing (see questions), since there were no interventions done that would make the model pick the _alternative_ move. If indeed the model was deciding between two variations, patching moves from the principal variation should lead to a _reduction_ in log-odds of the primary move."

I suspect the audience for this paper could be rather limited, as it relies heavily on the interpretability techniques and evaluation methods introduced in the previous paper. Furthermore, it does not introduce new methodology, other than filtering the dataset into more fine-grained subsets. (Though I do think it answers interesting and unresolved questions from the prior work.)\n\n2. The substantial filtering required to find positions that satisfy the constraints for deeper lines and multiple lines means that they use a much smaller dataset, and the results are likely less statistically significant. However, it should be possible to run these experiments on a much larger starting dataset, and it would be interesting to see if these findings hold up.\n\n3. The log odds reduction plots (e.g. Fig 2) use hue and line-style that are quite unintuitive. I would suggest either making the colors distinct for distinct board squares, or use solid/dashed to distinguish the main/alt line with the same hue for the same move. In any case, there should be some simple scheme that's clearly documented in the main text.\n\n4. The core result seems to be the finding that the model considers multiple move sequences, instead of just the main line. This is significant, as it means the model does search and not just look-ahead. However, these results are explained in just a few paragraphs near the end of Sec 3. I would suggest expanding this section.\n\n5. I would also recommend the authors include (perhaps in the appendix) details about the methodology that are derived from the Jenner et al. paper, so that readers unfamiliar with the prior work will be able to understand what's going on."

In certain types of problems, e.g. checkmate in 2 / 3 moves, often both the square which a given piece leaves and the one which the piece moves to are important, as leaving a given square has immediate consequences in terms of stopping the attack/defence of specific squares. What is the basis for the above claim?"

The idea is that a similar approach could present insights into the operations or pseudo cognitive processes of neural networks."

Chess is really well defined, and the rules are clear and we know how to perform search and lookahead.  In a more complex (and with this I mostly mean less well defined and messy environment) it might be difficult to apply a similar approach.\nI understand it is always easy to ask for more, but I think the impact of your work would be greatly improved if you could provide an, even conceptual, study of a less well defined environment.
