    "title": "Leveraging LLM Embeddings for Cross Dataset Label Alignment and Zero Shot Music Emotion Prediction",
    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel method for music emotion recognition that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings for label alignment across multiple datasets and zero-shot prediction on novel categories. First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.",

                "value": "Here are my major concerns.\n\n1. The word LLM used here is a bit misleading to me. If I read the \"LLM\" used in this work properly, it seems to be a sentence transformer that was modified from BERT by using siamese and triplet network for training which can help derive semantically embedding for sentences that can used to calculate cosine-similarity. The LLM here is not the causal large-scale LLM like GPT.\nIf BERT-style models are non-causal LLM, if the authors want to claim large-scale LLM can generally bring in huge benefits to this problem especially in generalization to unseen labels, I would encourage the authors to break down between causal and non-causal style models. \nEspecially, some LLMs do not natively output semantic embedding, the authors may want to describe how they do that generally, and also do comparison among different LLMs with different training strategies and model size. \n\n2. The baseline design does not make too much sense to me. From baseline 2 to baseline 1, there are at least two variables, one is the authors use more datasets, and the other is introducing the LLM embedding clustering. Can we have a baseline with LLM that's just based on one single dataset?\n\n3. Do different clustering methods matter? This is not studied and mentioned.\n\n4. The authors described a specific way to extract representations from MERT (e.g., 3/6/9/12 layers). The authors should explain the motivations. As you eventually go to a follow-up linear projection layer, why not use all layers?\n\n5. Overall, the algorithm makes sense but does not show a lot of novelty. One major attracting point is the claim that using embeddings from LLM will help, but the results to support that claim are not strong enough. This also relates to my major concern point 1."

First, label's language embedding is extracted. Second, label embeddings are clustered. Third, audio encoder is learned to match with the clustered label embeddings. Finally, in the inference stage, they conducted zero-shot prediction using unseen label's embedding (or non-parametric clusters). In this work, the authors used LLM embeddings as a labels' language embedding extractor, and MERT audio encoder, Mean Shift clustering, triplet loss and regularization techniques are used. Overall, the paper is easy-to-read. However, the lessons the readers can acquire from the paper is limited in terms of the novelty of the technique, the experimental result, and analysis of the phenomenon."

However, I think this is not enough for measuring the zero-shot ability. In MTG-Jamendo, CAL500, and Emotify datasets are distinct in terms of the data instances, however, I think there exist some overlaps in the labels between the datasets. Therefore, what the authors mainly measured through the experiments was instance-level or dataset-level zero-shot prediction capability however, this experimental design may have not considered the zero-shot learning ability on the unseen label thoroughly. Also, the used datasets are mostly multi-labeled emotion datasets, so applying zero-shot learning experimental design that were developed in single-labeled task may not be enough for measuring multi-label zero-shot learning experiments."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I think if the authors would want to emphasize on the proposed methodology, then the experimental design should be enhanced with more diverse datasets with more strict seen / unseen dataset separation. Also, if the main contribution is on the proposed methodology, then maybe including more tasks and datasets might make the paper more solid, such as zero-shot music tagging, audio tagging, etc. Or, if the main contribution is on zero-shot emotion prediction task itself, then more in-depth experimental design on emotional label might be helpful to highlight the authors contributions. For example, analysis over certain emotion tags that are used in multiple datasets, such as how this emotion tag is used slightly differently over each datasets, and how the proposed method bridge this difference well. Case studies over emotion labels would also be beneficial."

In case of Emotify data, how were the top 3 labels converted to LLM embeddings?

                "value": "- The introduction lacks a proper literature review. For example, the claim that \"the majority of studies have focused on training and testing with a single dataset\" is inaccurate. Since 2022, many audio-language papers (e.g., LTU, CLAP, GAMA) and music-language models (e.g., MuLan, MuLaP) have been trained on multiple emotion recognition datasets.\n- The choice of methods, such as the specific LLM used for embeddings, Mean Shift clustering, and the alignment regularization formulation, lacks theoretical support or empirical justification. The paper would benefit from a deeper discussion on why these choices were made and how they compare to alternatives like k-means clustering, l2 regularization, etc.\n- The baselines used for comparison are relatively simple. The paper does not include comparisons with multi-task learning, transfer learning techniques, or zero-shot models that could also address cross-dataset generalization. Recent works, for instance, train on valence, arousal, dominance, and other emotion views to avoid dealing with different emotion labels across datasets. Another approach is SSL training across datasets, followed by linear probing on target datasets. For zero-shot approaches, models like CLAP, LTU, and GAMA can support any emotion classes, providing alternative ways to overcome predefined class limitations. Including these baselines would help contextualize the proposed method and offer further analysis on where it outperforms or underperforms existing methods.\n- While alignment regularization improves zero-shot performance, it seems to degrade cross-dataset generalization. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs involved and whether the zero-shot improvement outweighs the generalization loss."

Adding empirical comparisons, such as how Mean Shift performs relative to k-means or other clustering methods, would help support the hypothesis the authors have\n- Can the authors consider adding general baselines that utilize multi-task learning across emotion dimensions, self-supervised learning (SSL) across datasets followed by linear probing, or zero-shot models like CLAP, LTU, and GAMA, which support arbitrary emotion classes?
