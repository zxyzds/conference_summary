    "title": "Designing Mechanical Meta-Materials by Learning Equivariant Flows",
    "abstract": "Mechanical meta-materials are solids whose geometric structure results in exotic nonlinear behaviors that are not typically achievable via homogeneous materials. We show how to drastically expand the design space of a class of mechanical meta-materials known as $\\textit{cellular solids}$, by generalizing beyond translational symmetry. This is made possible by transforming a reference geometry according to a divergence free flow that is parameterized by a neural network and equivariant under the relevant symmetry group. We show how to construct flows equivariant to the space groups, despite the fact that these groups are not compact. Coupling this flow with a differentiable nonlinear mechanics simulator allows us to represent a much richer set of cellular solids than was previously possible. These materials can be optimized to exhibit desirable mechanical properties such as negative Poisson's ratios or to match target stress-strain curves. We validate these new designs in simulation and by fabricating real-world prototypes. We find that designs with higher-order symmetries can exhibit a wider range of behaviors.",

Specifically, the problem setting is not clear, there is little/no discussion of existing methods to solve the problem, and the limitations of existing methods are also unclear.  These problems make it very difficult to review the work.    \na) Line 39: \"Existing approaches to cellular solids..\".  What is an \"approach\" to cellular solids referring to?...an approach to what? \nb) Line 45: What is \"shape optimization\"?  We're optimizing the shape for what purpose? This is machine learning conference, and this topic might not be clear to your audience (e.g., me). \nc) Line 48: The authors begin talking about their solution, but it is unclear at this point (i) what problem they're trying to solve, (ii) what approaches exist to solve this problem, and (iii) how using \"flow\" is going to mitigate these problems.  \nd) Line 48:  What exactly is \"flow\" in this context?   I see there is a \"Related Work\" section at the end of the paper, and it cites three papers that the authors claim have studied \"Neural network flows\" in recent years, however, I looked at the most recent of these cited references, Cranmer et al. 2020, and the word \"flow\" is never mentioned.  It remains unclear to me what exactly the authors are discussing. \n\n2) The authors present some results with their approach, but there is no mention or comparison with any other existing approaches."

Presumably there is some data-driven learning problem so that this work is suitable for this research community: could the authors explain more clearly what it is?  \n\n2) Why don't the authors discuss, or compare with, any other existing approaches for metamaterial design? There are a large number of data-driven inverse design approaches.  Perhaps there is a good reason, but given the problem I cited in (1), it is unclear to me. \n\nSee the following reference for some examples, but there are many:  Ardizzone, Lynton, et al. \"Analyzing inverse problems with invertible neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.04730 (2018)."

The space group and the desired property must first be fixed, and as the network trains, it converges to some design that optimizes the loss. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to generate multiple valid designs without training every time.\n\nOne other concern is that I wonder if this paper is suitable for this venue. As a reviewer who doesn't know much about meta-materials design, it is difficult for me to judge the impact of the proposed method and the results. The best I can tell about the results is that the manufactured design seems to match the simulation measurements."

This is a good focus at times when much of the work in the field is on strut-based lattice metamaterials.\n\nThe idea of starting out with an initial model with well-behaved connected topology and morphing it into a flowed model is important \u2013 for a well-behaved flow, one will not end up with defective topology and disconnected patches of material (as opposed to what one might obtain by using fully generative models such as diffusion).\n\nPart of having a well-behaved flow is ensuring it is volume-preserving. The authors incorporated an idea from the literature in which a divergence-free flow is obtained as vector whose components are appropriately arranged partial derivatives of a scalar function. This enables to set an original relative density $\\bar{\\rho}$ which is then preserved by the flow."

The emphasis on validation with real-world prototypes is only tangentially relevant to the presented work. \nE.g. in abstract: \u201cWe validate these new designs in simulation and by fabricating real-world prototypes.\u201d There are two statements to unpack: \n    1.\tvalidate these new designs in simulation - this is not really validation since the training loop already involves the differentiable simulator\n    2. validate these new designs by fabricating real-world prototypes \u2013 this is not really the validation of the presented equivariant flows, but rather a validation that the differentiable mechanics simulator captures real-world behaviour of the structures\n\n    Overall please change the way in which such claims are formulated:\n        (i)\tany claimed \u201cvalidation of simulations with respect to target behaviour\u201d is only a test that the target behaviour is within the expressive power of the framework. It would be interesting to push this to the limit \u2013 for instance, what would happen if you tried to design for tension while setting as the target the same stress-strain curve which you use in compression? \n        (ii)\t\u201cvalidation by manufacturing real-world specimens\u201d is only a check of the ability of the differentiable mechanics simulator to capture real-world behaviour of the structures.\n\n3. One limitation identified in section 7 for scaling up to 3d structures is the lack of efficient/fast solvers and the high number of degrees of freedom. In section 5 it is mentioned that 25000 degrees of freedom were needed for force-displacement experiments.

Many other machine learning methods could also satisfy the conditions outlined in Theorem 2 and the loss function. Why is the neural network preferred?

Does the configuration\u2014such as the number of hidden neurons, layers, or the choice of activation function\u2014affect the simulation accuracy?
