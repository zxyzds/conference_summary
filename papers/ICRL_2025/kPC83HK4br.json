    "title": "CHAMP: Conformalized 3D Human Multi-Hypothesis Pose Estimators",
    "abstract": "We introduce CHAMP, a novel method for learning sequence-to-sequence, multi-hypothesis 3D human poses from 2D keypoints by leveraging a conditional distribution with a diffusion model. To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end-to-end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.",

The novel aspect is applying the tools of conformal prediction to this task. That is, the authors propose to learn a conformity score function in an adversarial setup and simulate conformal prediction during training, directly minimizing the conformal set size (the inefficiency). Quantitative evaluation is performed on the well-known Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with additional qualitative evaluation on in-the-wild videos. Results show that filtering according to conformity scores and aggregating the results improves the metrics and achieves state-of-the-art results. Ablations also show that the end-to-end training of the scoring function is beneficial."

Multi-hypothesis 3D pose estimation has been a relevant research area due to ambiguities in the task, but practical methods are often not formulated in a proper probabilistic manner. Using conformal prediction techniques is a promising direction and taking a first step in this direction is relevant to the community.\nThe overview of the related works is extensive, and the comparison of them helps the reader to place this work in relation to them. The text is well-structured and easy to follow.\nThe authors use already existing techniques in good ways, for example using the already proven MixSTE model for denoising, incorporating adversarial training and conformal calibration.\nResults on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP both demonstrate the benefit of the method.\nAblations and hyperparameter studies confirm the design choices."

How should we interpret the fact that \"CHAMP-Agg\" is better than \"CHAMP\"? Does it mean that the proposed learned conformity scoring does not perform better than the prior method of aggregation proposed by Shan et al. (2023)?\n\nTo the paragraph after Eq. 5: How can we interpret the \"true value to be included in\" the conformal set in case of continuous values like 3D coordinates? In case of classification this makes more sense, but perhaps the language has to adjusted here.\nWhat 2D pose estimator is used in the main experiments, or is the ground truth used?\nWhy are values missing from Table 3?\n\nSmaller issues:\nGAN is cited as the CACM 2020 paper, but perhaps the original NIPS 2014 version is better suited for citation.\nIn Eq 9, perhaps Temperature could be denoted by some other symbol because mathcal{T} and tau look very similar visually (except for size). Similarly I would not recommend relying on the subtle difference between C and mathcal{C} for important differences (as noted in the footnote of page 6), a hat, tilde or similar feature may be more visible.\n\nPage 7: Human3.6M is no longer the \"largest indoor dataset for 3D human pose estimation\". There are many larger ones such as DNA-Rendering.\nIt should be stated explicitly that E2E refers to \"end-to-end\"."

Following previous methods, they also adopt a diffusion model to regress the 3D pose hypotheses from sequential 2D pose inputs. Different from previous work, this paper proposes to learn a score model along with the regression model to predict the confidence of multiple regressed hypotheses. The scores of multiple hypotheses could be used to filter out the outliers to refine prediction set.   \nThe eperiments are mostly conducted on two benchmarks, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Compared with directly averaging all multi-hypothesis predictions, averaging filtered predictions with the proposed score model reduces 1.5mm MPJPE on Human3.6M, while selecting the 3D pose whose 2D projection is more consistent with the 2D pose further reduces 1.5mm MPJPE on Human3.6M."

Additionally, generating multiple 3D hypotheses using diffusion models is already a widely used technique (DiffuPose (Choi et al., 2023) DiffPose (Gong et al., 2023) DiffPose (Feng et al., 2023) D3DP (Shan et al., 2023)). If the only contribution is the use of CP, its novelty might be limited. If the authors could show that the CP strategy also performs well in single-RGB input cases or demonstrates its effectiveness in single-image mesh estimation, it would significantly enhance the paper's contribution.\n2. The quantitative results are not very solid. The improvement on 3DHP is quite marginal, making it unclear whether the improvement is due to random seed variation. These results do not convincingly support the method's effectiveness.\n3. The visual results (e.g., Figure 10) do not show cases where severe occlusion leads to incorrect 2D estimates or cases where 3D depth errors occur. It\u2019s important to demonstrate that CP can filter out incorrect hypotheses in such challenging cases, where multi-hypothesis generation is truly necessary. This ties back to the first weakness, as the temporal nature of the data may already provide additional constraints, reducing ambiguity. Therefore, the authors should explore more varied tasks to prove CP's efficacy, such as monocular pose estimation."
