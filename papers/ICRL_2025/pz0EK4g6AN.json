    "title": "QCircuitNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Quantum Algorithm Design",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. \nDespite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. \nIn this work, we introduce QCircuitNet, the first benchmark and test dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms in the form of quantum circuit codes. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally different and significantly more complicated due to highly flexible design space and intricate manipulation of qubits. \nOur key contributions include: \n1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design task for Large Language Models.\n2. Implementation for a wide range of quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, with easy extension to more quantum algorithms.\n3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection.\n4. Promising potential as a training dataset through primitive fine-tuning results.\n\nWe observed several interesting experimental phenomena: fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning, and LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns. QCircuitNet provides a comprehensive benchmark for AI-driven quantum algorithm design, offering advantages in model evaluation and improvement, while also revealing some limitations of LLMs in this domain.",

Directly using LLMs to design quantum algorithms remains challenging. For workflows like Figure 2, can LLMs only learn specific quantum algorithms? However, with the limited algorithms/circuit types in the current benchmark, it seems insufficient to evaluate LLMs\u2019 ability to design arbitrary quantum algorithms.\n\n3. The current setup relies on classical simulations for verification, which limits scalability and slows down processes, especially for higher qubit counts. If real quantum computers are used, significant noise will be present. In such cases, how can effective verification be ensured?"

The paper did not clarify any circuit features, or algorithm features, or device features. \n\nMeanwhile, It seems this work only focuses on oracle-based quantum algorithms, which represents a very small group of quantum algorithms that were well-known and developed many years ago (and is also not the main focus of the quantum computing/algorithm community).\n\nIt seems to me this claimed \u2018dataset contribution\u2019 is only a different way of selling the application benchmarks by (i) collecting the standard descriptions of particular quantum algorithms from text or existing paper; (ii) running in Qiskit-Aer to obtain standard output as the reference; (iii) adding metric measurement functions for the feedback/reward/gradient, which can be easily achieved using the MQTBench templates online. With that, I don\u2019t think the technical contribution is sufficient for an ICLR publication. \n\nLast but not least, the word \u2018post-processing\u2019 is confusing, as in quantum computing, post-processing usually refers to error-mitigation."
