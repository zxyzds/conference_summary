    "title": "DiffImp: Efficient Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation with Bidirectional Mamba Backbone",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1) \\textit{ The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2) \\textit{ The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1) The main motivation of model compatibility in diffusion-based imputation is not well-stated. Seems like authors would investigate which backbone is more suitable for diffusion model. It does not clear what certain limitation in using other models as the backbone, since CNN, Transformer, and SSM are channel independent and unidirectional. \n2) Authors claim the proposed method is channel-dependent and has low complexity. But it seems like using SSM in a different way, i.e., modeling across channel correlation. I do not agree this point can be stated as a drawback. If capturing inter-channel relationships is one of the key motivations for this paper, I would like to know why these relationships are essential for the imputation task and what issues might arise from ignoring them. But, this discussion is missing from the paper.\n3) In the original SSSD paper, ECG data was also used for experiments, and the model was evaluated based on imputation accuracy and visualization. The ECG experiments were significant in the SSSD paper, yet it appears the authors did not include this experiment in their current paper. Given that the authors replicated other experiments from the SSSD paper, omitting this key experiment seems unusual. Without it, the authors only tested their method on two datasets for the imputation task. Including additional datasets could enhance the reliability of the results.\n4) Have the authors tried other approaches for modeling channel-wise dependencies? As noted in the paper, there is no clear order among channels in multivariate time series, so using an order-agnostic attention mechanism for inter-channel relationships is intuitive. However, the motivation for using the Mamba model to capture inter-channel relationships is unclear, as state space models typically assume a temporal order in the data. Could the authors provide further explanation to clarify the rationale behind the channel Mamba block? Additionally, an ablation study on channel modeling would be beneficial."

It appears to be an exploratory study investigating a good model combination without clearly defining a technical, theoretical, or practical research question. Vanilla CNN, Transformer, and SSM are just model architectures; using them in an appropriate way does not, in itself, demonstrate significance. Overall, the contribution of this paper is limited, and a more comprehensive literature review and clearer positioning within the research field are needed."

As discussed in Section 1, the main contribution is proposing a diffusion-based framework for time series imputation, by integrating Mamba-based blocks into diffusion models. However, diffusion models have been proved to be effective in time series imputation, and Mamba is also an existing technique. Modeling bidirectional dependencies and channel dependencies are common techniques to capture characteristics of time series data. Therefore, the novelty and contributions are limited.\n\nW2. There is no theoretical result to support the proposed techniques.\n\nW3. It is unbelievable that the time cost is totally ignored in experiment results, since the main contribution claimed by authors is that the linear complexity of proposed models.\n\nW4. Only synthetic missing values are considered in experiments. It is suggested to use real-world incomplete datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed methods.\n\nW5. 70%, 80%, 90% missing values are injected into the MuJoCo dataset, and 10%, 30%, 50% missing values are considered into the Electricity dataset. It is wondered why different missing rates are considered in different datasets, why not consider 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% for them consistently.\n\nW6. Since all the imputation baselines can impute incomplete time series, it is suggested to consider the comparison with them in all datasets, instead of using a subset of them in different datasets.\n\nW7. Scalability experiments are necessary to demonstrate the linear complexity of this paper. Therefore, it is suggested to conduct this on additional large real-world datasets.\n\nW8. There is no parameter sensitivity analysis in experiments, which is also suggested to show the stability of models and illustrate how to determine parameters.\n\nW9. Although the source code has been released, there is not guideline for how to use the codes and how to get the experimental results for each table and figure, leading to the doubts of reproducibility."
