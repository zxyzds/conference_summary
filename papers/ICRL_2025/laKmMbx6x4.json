    "title": "Revisiting the expressiveness of CNNs: a mathematical framework for feature extraction",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision, with convolutional neural network models proving to be very effective for image classification benchmarks. Given their widespread adoption, several theoretical works have analyzed their expressiveness, and study the class of piecewise linear functions that they can realize. However, a fundamental theoretical questions remain answered: why are piecewise linear functions effective for feature extraction tasks that arise in image classification? We address this question in this paper by introducing a simplified mathematical model for feature extraction, based on classical template matching algorithms that are commonly used in computer vision. We then prove that convolutional neural network classifiers can solve this class of image classification problems, by constructing piecewise linear functions that detect the presence of features, and showing that they can be realized by convolutional neurons. We also discuss the interpretability of the networks we construct, and compare them with those obtained via gradient-based optimization methods by conducting experiments on simple datasets.",

                "value": "While this presents a nice goal, the current use of template matching only accounts for rigid templates, which I think is overly simplified to provide much significant insight.  ConvNet features can become nonzero (sometimes with different degrees of strength) in the presence of image components with deformations from a single appearance.  [1] shows variation in appearance corresponding to different neurons, for example.  This is important in practical use --- otherwise templates are constrained to exact-match and could be implemented with a single large conv kernel.\n\nTemplate matching is also used and then layered in older deformable parts models [4], and these are shown in [2, 3] to correspond to shallow convnets.  So the correspondence between image part templates and convnets has been well-established for some time.\n\nThe two main theorems in this work are existence proofs, but if any piecewise linear function can be implemented by some network according to the related work in the \"Expressiveness\" section at l.107, then existence of a network that can implement template matching exactly seems like it would follow from these almost immediately, unless I'm missing something here?  A stronger theoretical result that would be more interesting might relate to numbers of layers, dimensions and/or model capacity to bounds on how well a template function can be approximated, for example.\n\nThe empirical results are also rather limited, only studying the responses of a shallow network with single conv layer and fully connected layer.\n\n\n[1] Zeiler and Fergus ECCV 2014 \"Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks\"\n\n[2] Girshick et al.

Then the  hypothesis is used to build an interesting theoretical framework. Finally experiments with RELU networks trained in the usual way do not support the predictions. \n\nA natural reaction may well be: why to publish a theory that is not supported by the experiments? I am more tolerant: I am not against publishing negative results and in fact I think that it is sometime a good idea. However, the fact that the theory is falsified by the experiments should be made clear throughout the paper, for instance  in the abstract. This may be an approach for how to rewrite the paper for a future submission.\n\nThere is another significant problem however. The authors say \"a fundamental theoretical questions remain answered: why are piecewise linear functions effective for feature extraction tasks that arise in image classification?\". I think the general answer to the  question has been pretty clear for a long time; it is well known that piecewise linear splines are universal approximators in d dimensions. The hierarchical version of this for deep NNs can be found in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11633-017-1054-2.

Therefore it is not clear to me what you mean when  you say \"...why the class of piecewise linear functions is suitable for feature extraction\". Perhaps an explanation of what you mean with \"feature\" will make clearer what you mean. Or, is it perhaps the case that your concept of  feature extraction is  the same as template matching? In this case, could your experimental results imply that template matching or feature extraction are not good account of how deep nets perform classification?"
