    "title": "Generative Editing via Convolutional Obscuring (GECO): A Generative Adversarial Network for MRI de-artifacting",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the dominant diagnostic technique to non-invasively image the brain, and deep learning has proven a powerful tool for analyzing these images. However, machine learning models trained on such MRI data have empirically shown an ability to detect complex and invisible artifacts, such as which type of machine a scan was taken from to a high degree of accuracy. Such artifacts are potentially invisible to the human eye, but can be identified by machine learning systems, leading them to focus on irrelevant features rather than scientifically and/or medically useful ones. For example, machine learning systems can often \u201cshortcut\u201d past the actual features researchers would like to detect and utilize separate spurious correlations to make predictions. Several such undesired features have been reported to interfere with cross-institutional medical imaging deep learning research, and more are likely to be identified as time goes on. Here, we develop a method capable of removing these spurious correlations in an unsupervised manner, leveraging generative techniques to produce images which maintain image quality while learning how to remove technical artifacts. Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of deep learning architectures which have shown impressive efficacy in image generation and editing tasks, and our work builds upon this success. Here, we propose Generative Editing via Convolutional Obscuring (GECO), a Generative Adverserial Network for MRI deartifacting. GECO is based on a CycleGAN, a GAN architecture designed for image-to-image translation that is transforming an input image into a new image with one or more desirable properties. By formulating the CycleGAN loss as a two-player game with a regularization term and incentivizing the generator to erase spurious correlations the original image quality can be better preserved. Beginning with classifiers trained on original images to identify images based on artifacts of interest, GECO reduced the classifiers\u2019 ability to detect these spurious correlations from 97% down to a difference which is nearly equal to a classifier making purely random guesses. We also observe over 98% structural similarity between the original and deartifacted images, indicating the preservation of the vast majority of non-spurious information contained in the original images. In addition to solving the known problem of avoiding artifacts from scanner type, this method opens the door to potentially removing many other types of spurious correlations from medical images and other data modalities across many fields.",

However, in my opinion, deartifacting task falls in medical imaging harmonization, where there are previous works [2][3]. It would be better for authors to conduct downstream tasks, for example, classification or segmentation, of the images harmonized using GECO, and the previous methods.\n\n3.

                "value": "Artifacts in medical imaging can have multiple types. Some of them can significantly harm the generalizability of the models, for example, the text labels in the medical imaging. Based on the figure 1, the difference between the generated and the original images is minor. There is a concern that such artifacts would affect the performance on downstream tasks and to what extent. For example, one way to verify the harmonization process is to train the models using original and harmonized images, and test on set from another manufactures. Adding evaluation on potential downstream tasks can add more strengths to the paper."

By applying GECO, the classifier's ability to detect these spurious correlations dropped from 97% to near random-chance accuracy. Additionally, a high structural similarity was observed between the original and artifact-free images, indicating that the vast majority of non-spurious information in the original images was retained.

The study lacks experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and verification of spurious information removal for downstream tasks.\n3. In Figure 1, the visualized \u201cDifferences\u201d appear primarily as high-frequency edge information variations and background artifact removal. The edge high-frequency differences are largely due to the network's smoothing effect on outputs, which is common in generative tasks and does not necessarily represent spurious information. Removing background artifacts as spurious information has limited practical value, as downstream tasks typically apply background removal preprocessing to prevent background artifacts from impacting performance."
