    "title": "Conditional Diffusion with Ordinal Regression: Longitudinal Data Generation for Neurodegenerative Disease Studies",
    "abstract": "Modeling the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is crucial for early detection and prevention given their irreversible nature. However, the scarcity of longitudinal data and complex disease dynamics make the analysis highly challenging. Moreover, longitudinal samples often contain irregular and large intervals between subject visits, which underscore the necessity for advanced data generation techniques that can accurately simulate disease progression over time. In this regime, we propose a novel conditional generative model for synthesizing longitudinal sequences and present its application to neurodegenerative disease data generation conditioned on multiple time-dependent ordinal factors, such as age and disease severity. Our method sequentially generates continuous data by bridging gaps between sparse data points with a diffusion model, ensuring a realistic representation of disease progression. The synthetic data are curated to integrate both cohort-level and individual-specific characteristics, where the cohort-level representations are modeled with an ordinal regression to capture longitudinally monotonic behavior. Extensive experiments on four AD biomarkers validate the superiority of our method over nine baseline approaches, highlighting its potential to be applied to a variety of longitudinal data generation.",

The model's architecture integrates both cohort-level and subject-level characteristics through a dual-component approach. At the cohort level, it employs Bayes' Theorem combining an ordinal regression model (capturing disease stage relationships) with a kernel-based conditional distribution. For data generation, ConDOR utilizes two diffusion models: a Regional Diffusion Model (RDM) for generating baseline measurements across brain regions, and a Temporal Diffusion Model (TDM) for generating subsequent longitudinal data. The model also incorporates a domain conditioning mechanism to integrate data from multiple sources. The authors evaluate ConDOR on multiple biomarkers (Amyloid, Cortical Thickness, and Fluorodeoxyglucose) from two prominent neurodegenerative disease datasets (ADNI and OASIS), comparing against nine baseline methods including GANs, VAEs, and other diffusion-based approaches."

Specifically, did they keep all observations from each subject together, or did they split individual observations, potentially including different time points from the same subject in both training and test sets? It would be valuable to see how well the model predicts follow-up scans based on data from earlier time points, given that the Temporal Diffusion Model is a novel component. Additionally, for baseline models like DDPM that lack a temporal component, it would be interesting to understand how the authors utilize these models to generate follow-up scans over time.\n2. The Temporal Diffusion Model uses linear interpolation to model progression in age and labels, which may not be ideal, as transitions between disease states are often abrupt or follow complex patterns. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to see theoretical proof that such linear interpolation preserves the properties of diffusion models.\n3. Including some directions for future work in the conclusion would be beneficial for the research community."
