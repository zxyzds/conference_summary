    "title": "PARSE-Ego4D: Personal Action Recommendation Suggestions for Ego-Centric Videos",
    "abstract": "Intelligent assistance involves not only understanding but also action. Existing ego-centric video datasets contain rich annotations of the videos, but not of actions that an intelligent assistant could perform in the moment. To address this gap, we release PARSE-Ego4D, a new set of personal action recommendation annotations for the Ego4D dataset. We take a multi-stage approach to generating and evaluating these annotations. First, we used a prompt-engineered large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware action suggestions and identified over 18,000 action suggestions. While these synthetic action suggestions are valuable, the inherent limitations of LLMs necessitate human evaluation. To ensure high-quality and user-centered recommendations, we conducted a large-scale human annotation study that provides grounding in human preferences for all of PARSE-Ego4D. We analyze the inter-rater agreement and evaluate subjective preferences of participants. Based on our synthetic dataset and complete human annotations, we propose several new tasks for action suggestions based on ego-centric videos. We encourage novel solutions that improve latency and energy requirements. The annotations in PARSE-Ego4D will support researchers and developers who are working on building action recommendation systems for augmented and virtual reality systems.",

Though to the authors credit, the quantitative analysis is extensive.\n2) The lack of video input to any of the baselines results in the trained models missing a lot of contextual information (e.g. head cues) needed to decide when/what recommendations are useful. While it is reasonable video is not ingested by the model producing the pseudo ground truth (video is observed by the human annotators instead), the baselines would be much more powerful if they had access to video.\n3) The user study is highly subjective and largely prone to speculative error - of course, the best option would be to ask the actor the survey questions, but that would require a collection of a new dataset."

                "value": "1) I would encourage not just the dataset to be released, but also the LLM code for generating the dataset to be released. Many aspects of this dataset can easily be improved by future authors.\n2) I wonder if the authors of Ego4D would consider releasing a highly processed, anonymized descriptors of what the humans are searching when they use their cell phones. This would heavily inform when and what action recommendations are useful.\n3) The actions in Ego4D seem to skew heavily towards low-level physical actions. But the actions most helpful to an action recommendation dataset would be cognitive in nature (e.g. plan, wait, search, etc). These actions are represented in the Ego4D dataset, but very very few of the annotations of these actions exist - is it easy for you to see if the LLM does better at producing recommendations for these instances?"

Such carelessness raises concerns about whether the paper has incorporated review suggestions from NeurIPS or not. \n\n- Regardless of the previous point, a significant portion of the paper's content describes the creation of the dataset while leaving little space to describe the benchmark tasks, how these benchmark tasks differ from existing research, and whether they are significant enough to attract future researches to use these benchmark tasks. While the paper might be a reasonable consideration for a dataset track submission, it is too thin for a main conference paper in venues like ICLR. \n\n- The paper should seriously consider improving presentation clarity. For example, I have to read Section 4.2 multiple times, trying to understand what the authors mean by the \"implicit\" query-to-action task. It wasn't very clear. I also needed to refer back to Figure 1 and try to map that to the inline equation f: c \\to (q, a). This is just one place. Again, the paper is too focused to describe the dataset."

Did you omit \"others?\"\n2. Can you elaborate on why NLL is a good metric for Task 2? \n3. How did you choose these baseline methods for benchmarking? Why are there missing entries marked n/a? \n4. 80% of the dataset was rated by just 1 human rater. Is this going to be a limitation?"

This can cause instability in the training process of AI assistant models because the annotations collected by a single annotator might be too noisy. I believe that at least three answers should be collected and averaged (or decided by a majority vote).\n- [W2] The action suggestion annotations are highly imbalanced, which can also contribute to instability in the training/validation process. For example, the two types of \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cassistants\u201d account for over 80% of the annotations. On the other hand, \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201cother\u201d types account for only 0.02%. I believe breaking down \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cassistants\u201d types into multiple subdivisions solves this imbalance problem, which might be more practical for dataset users.\n- [W3] The explicit query-to-action task is merely a simple classification problem with only 6 classes. Even the simple baselines already achieve 87% accuracy. I highly believe that the authors should subdivide the action suggestions, especially for \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cassistants\u201d types.\n- [W4] The number of verified and high-quality suggestions (defined by the authors in line 220) is 7770, which seems too small and only accounts for 42.43% of the annotations. I believe that the authors should collect more high-quality annotations.\n- [W5] I do not believe that the negative log-likelihood (NLL) is the best metric for the implicit query-to-action task. There are other metrics besides BLEU (e.g., ROUGE, WUP, METEOR), and I believe that the authors should propose a new accuracy metric based on these existing ones.\n- [W6] The dataset does not consider continual interactions between humans and AI assistants, although the actual users will show continual aspects."
