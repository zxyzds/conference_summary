    "title": "Unleashing the Potential of Text-attributed Graphs: Automatic Relation Decomposition via Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual information with graph structures, offering unique opportunities for leveraging language models to enhance node feature quality. However, our extensive analysis reveals that the downstream task performance on TAGs is hindered by the graph structure itself; treating diverse semantics(e.g. \u201cadvised by\u201d, \u201cparticipates in\u201d) as a singular relation (e.g. hyperlinks). By decomposing conventional edges into distinctive semantic relations, we discover significant improvement in GNNs\u2019 downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we present **RoSE** (Relation-oriented Semantic Edge-decomposition), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically decompose graph structures into different semantic relations without requiring expensive human labelling or domain expertise. **RoSE** consists of two stages: (1) identifying semantic relations via an LLM-based generator and discriminator, and (2) decomposing each edge into corresponding relations by analyzing raw textual contents associated with connected nodes via an LLM-based decomposer. The decomposed edges provided by our framework can be applied in a model-agnostic, plug-and-play manner, enhancing its versatility. Moreover, **RoSE** achieve state-of-the-art node classification results on various benchmarks and GNN architectures.",

                "value": "The paper identifies the problem that conventional edges on text-attributed graphs hinder the representation learning process of GNNs on downstream tasks when integrated with advanced node features. To resolve the issue the edges are decomposed into semantic relations by the LLM. This has also been proposed as a data enhancement method where edge attributes are absent. \nThe relations are identified using an LLM-based relation generator and discriminator through prompting. To avoid labeling every edge and making a lot of LLM queries, similar relations are applied to similar semantic relations nodes with a threshold value."

On some datasets such as Cora and Pubmed, the improvement of proposed method is very limited. Can authors give intuitive reasons behind it?\n3. In some cases the semantic description between two nodes may not be able to be classified into several types, or require some domain knowledge. How the proposed method can handle those situations?"

The framework operates in two stages: (1) identifying potential relation types with an LLM-based generator and discriminator, and (2) categorizing each edge into identified relation types using LLMs. Extensive experiments show that RoSE leads to up to a 16% improvement in node classification accuracy on benchmark datasets."

A more detailed analysis of the computational cost compared to traditional methods would strengthen the paper.\n3. The relation discriminator's role and effectiveness are crucial to RoSE, yet the description of its implementation and performance impact lacks clarity.

The proposed efficient relation-type annotation strategy seems too simple. The assumption that the neighbor nodes should have a similar relation type with the central node is not realistic. For example, a paper can cite one paper via a positive sentiment but cite another via a negative sentiment.\n3. The proposed method can be viewed as an edge classification method. The authors should include some datasets with ground-truth edge labels to show how much the proposed method can approximate the ground-truth edge labels.
