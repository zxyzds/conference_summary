    "title": "From Search to Sampling: Generative Models for Robust Algorithmic Recourse",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost, plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to state-of-art baselines.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I think the major weaknesses are a lack of careful motivation of the proposed method, as well as a more direct comparison with methods beyond the field of algorithmic recourse (but can be directly applied). Specifically,\n\n- From the aspect of this specific problem (algorithmic recourse), if I understand correctly, the major improvement in the training process is the goal of Eq (4), which includes all properties that users care about (as well as the empirical distribution $Q(x^+|x)$ for sampling). However, to me, this task is different from sampling over $P(x|y=1)$ only because the additional cost function, $C(x,x')$ should be imposed. As a result, a very clear derivation is to sample from the distribution of $P(x|y=1)\\exp^{-\\lambda C(x,x')}$. The introduction of $V(x')$ seems to break the probabilistic explanation of the distribution, because $P(y=1|x)$ is naturally contained in $P(x|y=1)$ by the Bayesian law. In addition, the reason for choosing an auto-regressive model for sampling is also left unjustified, as sequential sampling is not a major concern in the problem. More justification (both intuitively and experimentally, and ideally, theoretically) of the technique selection is unavoidable. \n- From a more general sense of conditional generation, the problem of cost-aware sampling is not a novel problem and has been studied both in a general scenario and for specific generative models such as AR models or diffusion models. For instance, a direct method if to train a classifier-free diffusion model that allows sampling from $P(X,Y)$, and use a standard guidance technique (such that the $L_2$ norm like the CLIP score) to guide the diffusion process using $e^{-\\lambda C(X, X')}$. The proposed training technique for unpair data (Sec 4.1) is, in fact, a very standard processing technique that has been widely used, and the choice of AR model seems to be more strange than another generative model such as VAE and diffusion. Therefore, while I admit that joint training is a new approach (in this field, maybe), the author should compare with the above alternatives to see if the proposed method can outperform existing baselines. One paper for reference: [Learning from Invalid Data: On Constraint Satisfaction in Generative Models]. In addition, [Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance] is a straight-forward go-to method to compare with."

I believe there are subtleties here because it requires some generalization stuff. But all these aspects are absent in the paper.\n2. **Interpretability Issue**: While GenRe is effective in balancing recourse objectives, the generative approach may lead to less interpretable outputs, especially for stakeholders who require clear, actionable insights.
