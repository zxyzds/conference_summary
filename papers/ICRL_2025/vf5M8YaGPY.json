    "title": "The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions",
    "abstract": "Today's LLMs are susceptible to prompt injections, jailbreaks, and other attacks that allow adversaries to overwrite a model's original instructions with their own malicious prompts. In this work, we argue that one of the primary vulnerabilities underlying these attacks is that LLMs often consider system prompts (e.g., text from an application developer) to be the same priority as text from untrusted users and third parties. To address this, we propose an instruction hierarchy that explicitly defines how models should behave when instructions of different priorities conflict. We then propose a data generation method to demonstrate this hierarchical instruction following behavior, which teaches LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions. We apply this method to GPT-3.5, showing that it drastically increases robustness---even for attack types not seen during training---while imposing minimal degradations on standard capabilities.",

For instance, it makes sense for system messages to have the highest priority over user messages, as developers set the application's rules. However, when it comes to tool outputs, model outputs, and user inputs, defining clear priorities among them seems more complex. Each of these can generate problematic outputs. Could the authors elaborate on the reasoning behind defining these priorities? For example, is it because tool-generated outputs could potentially lead to more severe consequences (like deleting data or sending emails) if manipulated by certain attacks [1]?\n\n2.  The paper lacks specific examples of over-refusals, where benign instructions are mistakenly blocked, and where prompts resemble attacks but are safe to follow.\n\n3.

In Appendix B, the authors filter specific words like \"ACCESS GRANT\" and \"PLANETARY\" to determine defense success. I wonder if this filtering could lead to false positives or negatives. For instance, could the model output \"ACCESS GRANT\" without revealing sensitive information, or reveal a secret/password without using these specific keywords?\n\nI apologize for the late review (I received the review request on 10/30)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "A key conceptual weakness of the paper is in the grounding it offers for why the authors take the approach of introducing a hierarchy of instructions across different types of message. On page 1, the authors claim that they \"argue that the mechanism underlying all of these [prompt-injection, jailbreak, and system message extraction] attacks is the lack of instruction privileges in LLMs.\" But the only substantial argument for this appears in the form of an analogy at the start of Section 3. This analogy makes a comparison between LLMs and traditional operating systems. In particular, that the way in which LLMs often execute instructions from users in a way that disregards their system prompts resembles an operating system without the hierarchy of access and control that have been developed to protect modern operating systems from e.g. SQL injections. While a plausible, even intuitive, analogy, this is not an argument - in particular because it offers little explanation as to why models might appear to fail to treat instructions in their system prompt as more important than user messages, or the outputs of function calls. Further, they claim this to be a \"common analogy\" from the citation of 1.) An informative but informal, non-peer-reviewed blogpost from a researcher at OpenAI 2.) a paper from the Huggingface team (quoted in the previous blogpost) that proposes LLMs as a controller for managing multiple AI models to solve complex tasks. Neither make explicit mention of the kernel analogy which they were cited to justify. Even if this analogy held, the paper would be significantly stronger if it provided other justifications for the core approach. For example, I'm left wondering why they do not compare their method to other defense techniques, such as adversarial training, or post-deployment robustness measures [1] like probes or rapid response.\n\nA key weakness of the methods of the paper is that it is unclear how the authors' model learns the eponymous hierarchy across different message types. In the paper, the authors only relate that they train the model to ignore low-level misaligned instructions. From the sense of hierarchy / levels of privilege, I was expecting that the models would need to be trained on some sort of preference ordering, or at least that the model would be explicitly trained to e.g. comply with user instructions and not with tool outputs that conflict. \n\nFurther, I don't think there is enough context in the paper to replicate their training dataset generation. The authors do no adequately explain what they do with their preference ranking once they've categorised the instructions in their synthetic compositional requests by their hierarchy (nor do they explain whether this categorisation is manual/LM-generated, and what rubric / decisions they make to categorise their decomposed instructions. The authors simply write \"we then place these decomposed instructions at different levels of the hierarchy\" in section one and do not elaborate, instead repeating similar phrasing at the end of section 1 (088) , section 3.2 (203, 257). This act of \"placing\" the decomposed instructions into the hierarchy tells me very little about how this affects the way the model is trained, and more detail is needed. They outline a prompt-based method of explaining the hierarchy to the model in Appendix A / Table 3, but no mention is made of how this relates to the data they train on (the stacking experiment of adding the new system message on top of their trained hierarchy is interesting though).\n\nIt is also unclear to me how the authors determine a successful defense / attack. In Appendix B, there are helpful evaluation details. For some evaluations, the authors relate a certain bar the model had to clear for leaking its system prompt (\"measure how ). In the case of the Gandalf game dataset, the authors define a successful attack as \"We measure how often the model outputs \u201cPLANETARY\u201d in its generation.\" But to me, it seems that outputs such as \"PLANETAR\" would fail to be measured as a successful attack, despite being a significant leakage. Separately, for Jailbreaks, the authors only say that \"we evaluate by using GPT-4 to judge whether the model refused\" - without mention of checking some samples manually, I'd expect there to be some false positives/negatives, and think the paper could explicitly mention having checked details like this when using LM autograders - and perhaps have made note of this in the body of the paper. \n\nThe authors claim to not train on jailbreaks so as to display impressive transfer results zero shot. This is initially impressive but confusing, methodologically. Why not train on a subset of jailbreaks and hold others out? Why wouldn't this make your models more robust? Why not show that your method stacks with traditional adversarial training? There is also no commentary in the main paper on which jailbreaks are used, nor are useful examples given. In the appendix, the authors mention two sources from they procured jailbreaks. One is jailbreakchat.com - a website which is currently inaccessible, and the repo for which (https://github.com/alexalbertt/jailbreakchat) seems to have had no activity since mid 2023. The other source is described as \"ChatGPT jailbreaks w/ Unsafe Prompts\" - where \"We take known successful jailbreaks against ChatGPT and pair them with unsafe requests\" is the only context that's given. This makes me unsure if state of the art jailbreaks were used - but at least it seems that the jailbreaks the authors used were somewhat effective (e.g. Fig 3 reports only 83.8% robustness before their instruction hierarchy training). Nevertheless, more recent and more potent jailbreaks could presumably be used, and trained on. In particular, I'd be curious to see how well these results hold up against multi-turn/adaptive jailbreaks such as PAIR, or jailbreak strategies that leverage in-context learning like Many-shot jailbreaking[3]. \n\nThe \"Over-Refusal\" results reported in the paper are a weakness of their method. For example, they see a ~20% increase in false refusals on their jailbreakchat prompts. While the authors adversarially crafted this set to attempt to cause their method to falsely flag benign requests, formatted as jailbreaks, their discussion on the matter is limited to a single sentence, dismissing the results: \"Nevertheless, on typical real-world usages, we do not expect the instruction hierarchy to cause noticeable degradations in model behavior.\" This leaves me confused: if these prompts weren't sufficiently realistic, why design and plot them? Their first two measures seem reasonable for evaluating realistic settings for the other categories they defend against (system prompt leakage, and prompt injections). On page 6, they also report that \" Both models achieved comparable metrics on capabilities evaluations (e.g., TriviaQA, LAMBADA, HellaSwag), showing that the instruction hierarchy does not degrade generic capabilities.\" but I don't see any other mention of these results, nor any further details of what score the models achieved on these metrics before and after training - which at least might provide a baseline across normal-looking requests. \n\n\nNit:\n* There's some unpleasantly vibrant coloured highlighting of Aligned and Misaligned throughout the paper which is distracting and needless. \n\n[1] E.g. see Multi-layered defense-in-depth architecture in https://www.anthropic.com/rsp-updates\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08419\n[3] https://www.anthropic.com/research/many-shot-jailbreaking"

Also, cite harmbench?\n- **Extra clarity and consistency in section 3.2 would be helpful:**\n    - Surely putting commands at different levels of hierarchy can change the desired output, so make it clear that ground truth response changes in each case (unless I am misunderstanding?)\n    - \u201cnever saw the lower level instructions\u201d - don\u2019t you mean higher level ones? E.g. ones with highest privaledge in the system prompt\n    - I recommend aligning headings in Table 1 and rest of 3.2 for clarity on how examples relate to the implementation details\n    - You say \u201ctwo broad classes of applications: open and closed domain tasks\u201d but you have a third which is \u201cindirect\u201d.\n- **Including model output examples would enhance understanding**: Linking to some examples in the appendix would help the reader understand qualitatively the difference in model behaviour. For example, adding one of the new over refusals to read would be interesting to me.\n- **Related work lacks some citations**. Cite more on LLM defenses (short circuiting, input-ouput classifiers, R2D2 from HarmBench, smooth LLM, perplexity filtering etc). Cite more on automated red teaming (e.g. PAIR, TAP, GCG etc) and compare/contrast with yours."

                "value": "This work focuses on chat-tuned LLMs, which interact using prompts that are divided between system, user, and assistant messages (and potentially other message designations, such as tool outputs). Such models are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreak attacks, where the model either leaks confidential information or executes an instruction that is misaligned with the instructions given/trained in by its developers. The authors argue that this is due to a missing hierarchy of the different messages the model's prompt may contain, drawing an analogy to operating systems. They introduce the notion of instruction hierarchy, where instructions in higher ranking messages (system > user > assistant > tools/external) should take precedence over lower ranking instructions. To achieve this, they create a fine-tuning dataset containing both harmless and harmful instructions, with reference responses following the introduced notion of instruction hierarchy. For instance, in a harmful training sample where the user prompt contains a benign task and a harmful instruction contradicting the system prompt of the model, the reference response will contain only the execution of the benign task, teaching the model to ignore the instruction in a lower hierarchy message (user) that counters an instruction in a higher hierarchy message (system). Using this dataset, the authors fine-tune GPT-3.5 Turbo and show promising results both on in-distribution and transferred prompt injection and jailbreak attacks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Overall, while I believe that the conceptual contribution of the paper is strong, the empirical evaluation is weak and completely lacks baseline comparisons both in terms of utility and in terms of comparisons on robustness provided by related defenses. As such, the experimental evaluation of the paper is non-convincing and lies clearly below the standards of the conference. If the authors make major improvements and extensions to the evaluation, I am ready to significantly raise my score.\n\n**Single-model evaluation**\n\nThe authors only evaluate their method on GPT-3.5 Turbo. While I could assume that the method generalizes just as well to other models, this is not a given. For a rigorous evaluation models of different base capabilities, sizes, and architectures have to be evaluated. I could imagine that for instance for weaker models the proposed method would prove to be less effective, as the instruction hierarchy is a more complex dependency to model. \n\n**Lack of comparison to related works**\n\nThe proposed notion of instruction hierarchy is in some view a generalization of the instruction-data separation paradigm proposed in [1] and [2]. In fact, the instantiated solution in the lowest hierarchy (tool outputs) is nearly isomorphic to the solutions of the mentioned works. In my opinion, this warrants a more detailed discussion in the paper, already when building up to the proposed method in the early sections, and cannot be just mentioned on the fly in a late related work section. Further, as on certain hierarchy levels, and as such on certain robustness evaluations the proposed method and these prior methods are closely related, this warrants an empirical comparison in the evaluation section. Currently the evaluation section lacks any baseline comparisons to related methods.\n\n**Lack of utility evaluations**\n\nWhile the authors state that on an unknown set of utility benchmarks the method achieves \u201ccomparable\u201d performance to non-instruction-hierarchy fine-tuned models, they do not present (i) the evaluation protocol, (ii) the full set of examined benchmarks, and (iii) the actual results. As such, I cannot help but regard this statement of performance-preservation hand-wavy, once again, below the empirical evaluation standards of the conference. I would like to see a thorough utility evaluation of the proposed method, on benchmarks across different aspects of utility, such as factual knowledge, reasoning, and coding.\n\n**Dataset/experiments limited w.r.t. the proposed notion**\n\nThe trained and tested hierarchies currently define misalignment and alignment w.r.t. the system message. As such, the hierarchy between further, lower levels of the instruction does not come to play and the proposed notion collapses to a binary precedence of instructions, in which \u2018nothing may contradict the system message\u2019. However, this underexploits the potentials of instruction hierarchy. It would be interesting to see and crucial for validating the conceptual contributions of the method what happens if alignment instructions are introduced at different levels, e.g., the system message is generic and the user introduces a restriction that may not be overwritten by lower hierarchy messages (assistant or tool).\n\n**Some results are inconclusive and underdiscussed**\n\nCertain results are relatively weak and would warrant further discussion. An instance of this is the Prompt Injection (Indirect via Browsing) in Figure 2, where the baseline LM and the IH trained LM perform well within the uncertainty of each other. Another is the System Message Probing Questions experiment in Figure 4\u2014here it seems to me that the aligned examples for system message queries are weak.\n\n**Non-Reproducibility**\n\nThe authors give no fine-grained details on fine-tuning, the dataset creation, on the final datasets used, do not provide the source code of their method and evaluations, and only evaluate on a single proprietary model (GPT-3.5 Turbo). As such, the paper\u2019s results would be currently presumably impossible to accurately reproduce, prohibiting further research from building on top of it through fair and accurate baseline comparisons\u2014a process that I regard essential for robust progress in machine learning research.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] S Chen, J Piet, C Sitawarin, D Wagner.

                "value": "Additionally to my questions that implicitly arise from the weaknesses listed above, I would like to ask the authors about the following:\n\nFor the direct prompt injection dataset, the authors filter out examples where the prompt injection was successful on GPT-4. It would be interesting to know if there were certain \u201ctypes\u201d of prompt injection attacks that always broke GPT-4 and are as such underrepresented in the final fine-tuning dataset, or if the fine-tuning dataset is relatively evenly representing different prompt injection attempts.\n\nFor the system message extraction dataset, how did the authors define a line between misaligned and aligned user messages? Many basic queries about the system message could add up to a high leakage of information about the system message, where it becomes almost reconstructable.\n\nCan the authors give some examples on the system message query refusals from Figure 4?\n\nWhy does IH + system message lead to a significantly lower robustness on User Conflicting Instructions in Figure 5?\n\nIn Appendix B, for jailbreaks, the authors state that they insert the jailbreak message in the system prompt. Why so? Would this then not mean that the intended behavior of the model is to follow the jailbreak? Or is the trained-in alignment considered to be the 0-th hierarchy? If so, why is this not mentioned in the conceptual introduction of the method?\n\nIn the discussion section, the authors talk about system-level guardrails. I am interested in an expansion of this discussion. What do the authors believe, how much can be achieved on a model-level (can we hope for guarantees?), where is it wiser to rely on system-level guardrails, and what are the key trade-offs to consider when engineering model-level and system-level guardrails for certain risks?"
