    "title": "Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects",
    "abstract": "Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a novel setting for representing robotic manipulation problems as heterogeneous graph learning problems. The authors introduce a graph-based policy model, *Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi)*, featuring multiple *SE(3)* equivariant message-passing networks (EMPNs) to model smaller sub-graphs like actuators and objects. HEPi explicitly models heterogeneity by assigning distinct network parameters for each interaction type to reduce message mixing and improve expressiveness. HEPi is claimed to be the first study of equivariant policies on 3D space within a reinforcement learning setting for robotic manipulation.\n\nThe authors theoretically prove that, for HEPi any two actuator and object nodes can exchange information while the graph network with locally connected actuators and object nodes can not. This justifies their design of actuator nodes as global virtual nodes to connect all object nodes\n\nThe authors test the proposed heterogeneous graph representation with reinforcement learning for 6 rigid and deformable object tasks, including Rigid-Sliding, Rigid-Insertion, Rigid-Insertion-Two-Agents, Rope-Closing, Rope-Shaping, Cloth-Hanging. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is more sample efficient and less likely to converge on sub-optimal solutions compared with the state-of-the-art Transformer and non-heterogeneous EMPN methods."

The proposed approach of modeling robotic manipulation problems as heterogeneous graph learning problems is well-motivated and clever to unify the structure for both rigid and deformable object tasks using sub-graphs for actuators and objects.\n3. The adaptation of *SE(3)* equivariant message passing networks is reasonable and suitable to exploit the geometric symmetry for improving the sample efficiency in the large 3D search space of configurations. As far as I know, HEPi is one of the first studies of equivariant policies on 3D space within a reinforcement learning setting for robotic manipulation.\n4. The empirical experiments are comprehensive and sound to support the arguments. Most results are averaged over 10 seeds using\ninterquartile mean with 95% confidence intervals, which is also statistically robust."

                "value": "1. The experiments are limited to simple geometric shapes like ropes, triangles, and stars, which can be easily modeled using a few nodes (< 100 in all the experiments). However, the target objects in most 3D manipulation tasks are more complex and sophisticated, e.g., cabinets or dresses, which require significantly more nodes to model. I doubt whether HEPi can still generalize to all those complicated geometries, which brings much computational complexity to graph learning.\n2. The current framework assumes that the object coordinates are readily available in the observation, which is basically a simulation setting. In real applications without coordinates, such coordinates can only be extracted from other CV models in the wild. As a graph policy model, HEPi is likely to suffer from the cumulated error in the observation and fail the tasks compared to non graph learning methods.\n3. Some typos:\n- L17: objects -> object.\n- L182: \u201clifts\u201d, the left quotation mark.\n- L344: There should be a blank space before HEPi.\n\nNevertheless, the overall idea is novel, and empirical experiments are solid enough to support the proposed setting.

Nonetheless, I still recommend that the authors include some specific experiments to evaluate this aspect. I suggest author can simply add visual capture pipeline. The details are as follows:\n    + For task like rigid insertion and rigid sliding, you can simply add camera to take picture then use a common pose estimation module to estimate the position. The potential errors in pose estimation can be used to test the robustness of the proposed method to input errors.\n    + For tasks involving fabrics or ropes, you can directly use a camera to capture point clouds and then construct a graph using the point cloud data.\n+ Geometry aware: This paper does not seem to have any special designs focused on geometry, although graphs do play a role.

While the technical method and the story look promising, the benchmark scenes are still relatively simple because the setup only models a point-like end effector, ignoring kinematic and dynamic constraints in practical robotic hand/arm structures. Therefore, transferring the result to a real-world robot is not straightforward and probably requires more algorithmic development.\n\n2. From a dynamic perspective, the 2D rigid-sliding task is too trivial to be a valuable benchmark for evaluating this paper and its baselines. This is already reflected in the result: \u201cHEPi and Transformer policies perform comparably, suggesting that the limited task complexity does not fully leverage the benefits of equivariant constraints. \u201d I suggest this experiment remove the suction gripper and try pushing the rigid object to its target position and orientation with one/two end effectors and their contact with the object, similar to the setup in http://sain.csail.mit.edu/.\n\n3. Deformable objects can be classified by their dimensions: codimension-2 (e.g., ropes), codimension-1 (e.g., cloths), and codimension-0 (e.g., rubber balls). The paper seems to consider the first two categories only. Handling full-dimension soft objects in the proposed method may be non-trivial because it requires observations of object coordinates and cannot be easily obtained by \u201cintegrating state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract key points from cameras.\u201d I suggest the paper clarify this point by being more precise with the concept of deformable objects it deals with."
