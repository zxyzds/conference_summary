    "title": "SpaceSet: A Large-scale Realistic Space-based Image Dataset for Space Situational Awareness",
    "abstract": "Space situational awareness (SSA) plays an imperative role in maintaining safe space operations, especially given the increasingly congested space traffic around Earth. Space-based SSA offers a flexible and lightweight solution compared to traditional ground-based SSA. With advanced machine learning approaches, space-based SSA can extract features from high-resolution images in space to detect and track resident space objects (RSOs). However, existing spacecraft image datasets, such as SPARK, fall short of providing realistic camera observations, rendering the derived algorithms unsuitable for real SSA systems. In this research, we introduce SpaceSet, a large-scale realistic space-based image dataset for SSA. We consider accurate space orbit dynamics and a physical camera model with various noise distributions, generating images at the photon level. To extend the available observation window, four overlapping cameras are simulated with a fixed rotation angle. SpaceSet includes images of RSOs observed from $19 km$ to $63,000 km$, captured by a tracker operating in LEO, MEO, and GEO orbits over a period of $5,000$ seconds. Each image has a resolution of $4418 \\times 4418$ pixels, providing detailed features for developing advanced SSA approaches. We split the dataset into three subsets: SpaceSet-100, SpaceSet-5000, and SpaceSet-full, catering to various image processing applications. The SpaceSet-full corpus includes a comprehensive data-loader with $781.5GB$ of images and $25.9MB$ of ground truth labels. We also benchmark detection and tracking algorithms on the SpaceSet-100 dataset using a specified splitting method to accelerate the training process.",

                "value": "1. Considering the relatively small number of target objects (673) in the dataset, it is crucial for the authors to perform multiple experimental runs for object tracking tasks to obtain statistical mean values and variances. The authors should ensure that the variation in evaluation metrics across different runs (e.g. 3 or 5 runs) remains below a specified threshold (e.g., 0.5) to establish the reliability and stability of the results.\n2. Given that object scale is a critical factor influencing detection performance, the authors should provide comprehensive statistical analysis of object scales in the dataset, such as the distribution of object sizes (e.g., small, medium, and large objects). This information would help readers better understand the dataset characteristics and evaluation results."

            "weaknesses": {

Except for data generation, the information such as the properties of RSOs such as size and orientations, the positional distribution of frequently appearing locations in the images, and criterion for image splits is needed. Furthermore, there is a lack of detail regarding the benchmark experiments such as whether all models used input images of the same size or why do existing SOTA object detection and tracking methods not perform as well as expected on SpaceSet-100?\n\nAnother concern is the completeness of the paper. Although the completeness is an essential aspect of a paper, this paper contains awkward sentences, typos (e.g., L.140, 210, obit), grammatical errors (e.g., L.216 box are -> is). Regardless of whether these issues hinder understanding of the content, the lack of attention to such things is problematic.\n\nLastly, the content in A.5 intended to validate the proposed dataset\u2019s effectiveness in real-world data is not clearly conveyed. It would be beneficial to emphasize in the main paper why these metrics provided in Table.8 and 9 are meaningful."

                "value": "My major concern is the limited contribution. A pure dataset contribution may not align with the topic of the ICLR conference (Learning Representations). This paper benchmarks many existing detection and tracking algorithms on the proposed subset (SpaceSet-100). However, no new algorithms regarding learning representations are provided. \n\nAnother concern is the dataset setup. I understand the proposed one is already closer to real settings than previous ones, but it is still a synthetic dataset. I wonder what the gap is between the proposed synthetic and realistic settings. For example, the dataset uses a fixed camera setup, four overlapping cameras, and a fixed rotation angle. Is this always the real application scenario? Will any missions require a different number of cameras with other relative pose settings (e.g., unstructured)?\n\nIs there any available real dataset that could be used to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data or the synthetic-to-real generalization ability of an algorithm? \n\nSome illustrations might be clearer. For example, from Fig.1, I cannot figure out why (a) shows the realistic exposure with noise distribution, how exposure is reflected, what the noise distribution is, and why they are realistic. (b) shows a picture from an existing dataset, SPARK, but there isn't an image of the proposed dataset for comparison. (c) is almost black and I do not know where to put my focus."
