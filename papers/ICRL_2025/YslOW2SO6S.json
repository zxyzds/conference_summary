    "title": "CirT: Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting with Geometry-inspired Transformer",
    "abstract": "Accurate Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) climate forecasting is pivotal for decision-making including agriculture planning and disaster preparedness but is known to be challenging due to its chaotic nature. Although recent data-driven models have shown promising results, their performance is limited by inadequate consideration of geometric inductive biases. Usually, they treat the spherical weather data as planar images, resulting in an inaccurate representation of locations and spatial relations. In this work, we propose the geometric-inspired Circular Transformer (CirT) to model the cyclic characteristic of the graticule, consisting of two key designs: (1) Decomposing the weather data by latitude into circular patches that serve as input tokens to the Transformer; (2) Leveraging Fourier transform in self-attention to capture the global information and model the spatial periodicity. Extensive experiments on the Earth Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) reanalysis dataset demonstrate our model yields a significant improvement over the advanced data-driven models, including PanguWeather and GraphCast, as well as skillful ECMWF systems. Additionally, we empirically show the effectiveness of our model designs and high-quality prediction over spatial and temporal dimensions.",

                "value": "This paper propose an improved approach to the Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) climate forecasting problem. The method mainly has two novel parts: 1. A better input patching method which utilize the circular nature of the graticule. 2.  Propose to intervene Discrete Fourier Transform throughout the transformer layers. \n\nThe propose methods demonstrate improvement over all the existing methods, both numeric methods and data-driven method. And the propose method is especially effective in the long time horizon prediction compared to other autoregressive data-driven methods which suffer from error aggregation. The method also show better performance in the hard-to-predict areas like polar areas."

The paper compares the proposed method with both numerical method and ml method, and the metrics on latitude-weighted RMSE and Anomaly are strong and solid. The visualization graphs are very useful to understand the impact of the proposed method in different dimensions.\n\n2. The proposed method well utilize the characteristics of the input data modality. The circular patching strategy introduce a effective inductive bias, and the DFT well utilize the latitudinal spatial periodicity."

This weakens the comparison to other methods because the reader don't know whether the improvement is brought by the network architecture design or simply due to the increase in model size.\n\n2. It would be a plus if the paper could also include a ablation study of autogressive prediction vs directly predicting all the future values, to ablate the effectiveness of the autoregressive formulation. But I understand this might be consuming."

CIRT introduces significant innovations to address the lack of geometric inductive biases in prior work. Specifically, it partitions the graticule uniformly by latitude and leverages the Fourier transform to capture global features, which are then processed with self-attention.\n\n3. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the superiority of CIRT, comparing favorably with both numerical and data-driven models."
