    "title": "MetaGFN: Exploring Distant Modes with Adapted Metadynamics for Continuous GFlowNets",
    "abstract": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a class of generative models that sample objects in proportion to a specified reward function through a learned policy. They can be trained either on-policy or off-policy, needing a balance between exploration and exploitation for fast convergence to a target distribution. While exploration strategies for discrete GFlowNets have been studied, exploration in the continuous case remains to be investigated, despite the potential for novel exploration algorithms due to the local connectedness of continuous domains. Here, we introduce Adapted Metadynamics, a variant of metadynamics that can be applied to arbitrary black-box reward functions on continuous domains. We use Adapted Metadynamics as an exploration strategy for continuous GFlowNets. We show several continuous domains where the resulting algorithm, MetaGFN, accelerates convergence to the target distribution and discovers more distant reward modes than previous off-policy exploration strategies used for GFlowNets.",

As mentioned by authors, the exploration strategies in discrete setting can be adapted to the continuous setting. Authors should demonstrate the motivation of developing MetaGFN rather than adapting prevailing exploration strategies, by highlighting the unique advantage of it.\n- The complexity and running cost should be analyzed or evaluated."

In addition to the proposed MetaGFN approach, paper presents the results for a number of baseline techniques, which were proposed in the previous works for discrete GFlowNets but in turn adapted by the authors to the continuous case. A faithful comparison is carried out, showing that MetaGFN has superior performance on average, but also clearly stating its shortcomings in some cases. I found Figure 5 really insightful."

                "value": "I believe that the presentation of the proposed approach and the overall clarity of the paper can be greatly improved.\n\nWithout prior knowledge of metadynamics, it is challenging to understand the proposed approach from the text. Firstly, I suggest to move Section D of the Appendix to the main text, especially Algorithm 3, since it is crucial for understanding the overall structure of MetaGFN algorithm. Moreover, even though it is possible to understand the exact method from Algorithms 1, 2 and 3, I still have very little intuition about it. Before going into low-level details in Section 3, I would suggest adding a more high-level discussion explaining how the method works, some intuition behind it, and why it should improve exploration in continuous GFlowNets (Section 2.4 contains some, but it still doesn't give much high-level intuition). This would make the paper more accessible to a broader ML community.\n\nIn addition, some important details are unclear from the description of the experiments. Firstly, I failed to find in the text how collective variables are chosen for line and grid environments. The choice of collective variables is a crucial point in the algorithmic design of the proposed method, so emphasizing this is critical. Secondly, the clear descriptions of the choice of forward and backward kernels are missing. Especially little overall detail is given about grid environment. Is it the same as the one from [1]? It is possible that I missed some of these points while looking through appendix, but then it is one more reason to highlight them.\n\nNext, from my understanding, the efficiency of the method directly depends on the choice of lower dimensional collective variable space. However, the dimensions of spaces of terminal states in all experiments are very low themselves (the maximum dimension is 4), so the big question is whether the proposed method can perform well in higher-dimensional tasks. Thus I suggest adding some higher-dimensional environment to the experiments. The method can still be interesting and viable if it can only perform well in lower dimensions, but then this should be clearly stated as a limitation, or experimentally demonstrated otherwise.\n\nA minor detail, pdf works really slow when looking at Figure 4. I think reducing the density of the grids used to plot the training curves could help with it.\n\nIf all my concerns are addressed during rebuttal, I'm open to increasing my score.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Salem Lahlou, Tristan Deleu, Pablo Lemos, Dinghuai Zhang, Alexandra Volokhova, Alex Hern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda, L\u00e9na N\u00e9hale Ezzine, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin.

                "value": "0) Some experimental details are missing, see Weaknesses.\n\n1) Could the proposed approach be applied to diffusion sampling tasks, e.g. on environments from [2]? If yes, adding some to the experimental evaluation would further strengthen the paper.\n\n2) [2] introduces an approach where Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm is used to explore the space of terminal states, store the results in a replay buffer, and then use the backward policy to sample trajectories ending in points stored in the buffer. Thus it shares a lot of similarities with the proposed method. Do I understand correctly that it cannot be employed in your setup because MALA requires access to the reward gradient? I believe it is important to add a discussion about this to the paper, so the work is clearly positioned in comparison to previous litareture.\n\n3) In the definition of Measurable pointed graph, line 122, is it enough to bound the number of steps required to be able to reach any measurable set to guarantee acyclicity of the environment? The construction in [1] explicitly states that for some $N$, the support of $\\kappa^N\\left(s_0, \\cdot\\right)$ should contain only the sink state.\n\nReferences:\n\n[2] Marcin Sendera, Minsu Kim, Sarthak Mittal, Pablo Lemos, Luca Scimeca, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Alexandre Adam, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin.
