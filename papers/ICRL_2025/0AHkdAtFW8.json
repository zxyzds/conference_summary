    "title": "Sum-of-Squares Programming for Ma-Trudinger-Wang Regularity of Optimal Transport Maps",
    "abstract": "For a given ground cost, approximating the Monge optimal transport map that pushes forward a given probability measure onto another has become a staple in several modern machine learning algorithms. The fourth-order Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor associated with this ground cost function provides a notion of curvature in optimal transport. The non-negativity of this tensor plays a crucial role for establishing continuity for the Monge optimal transport map. It is, however, generally difficult to analytically verify this condition for any given ground cost. To expand the class of cost functions for which MTW non-negativity can be verified, we propose a provably correct computational approach which provides certificates of non-negativity for the MTW tensor using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming. We further show that our SOS technique can also be used to compute an inner approximation of the region where MTW non-negativity holds. We apply our proposed SOS programming method to several practical ground cost functions to approximate the regions of regularity of their corresponding optimal transport maps.",

                "value": "This paper presents a computational approach using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming to verify and approximate regions of regularity for optimal transport maps, specifically focusing on the Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor. Regularity of optimal transport maps is critical in many machine learning applications, and this regularity can be assured by the non-negativity of the MTW tensor. However, verifying this condition analytically for general cost functions is challenging. The authors propose using SOS programming to generate certificates of non-negativity for the MTW tensor across a broader range of cost functions, potentially providing computationally verified regions of regularity. Their method is applied to both verifying non-negativity conditions (the \"forward problem\") and to computing inner approximations of regularity regions (the \"inverse problem\") for several ground cost functions, demonstrating the effectiveness of SOS programming in this context. This computational framework contributes a systematic approach to certifying regularity in optimal transport, potentially facilitating its application in various machine learning tasks. The paper concludes by applying the proposed framework to several common examples in the literature."

SOS programming is a well-established tool in optimization and control, but this work extends it to OT regularity, opening new possibilities for computational verification of the MTW conditions in general cases where analytic approaches are intractable. The paper also showcases the practical efficacy of the approach by applying it to various cost functions, demonstrating its flexibility and adaptability across different scenarios."

In these settings, population measures are estimated based on samples and so (i) absolute continuity cannot be verified a priori, (ii) upper and lower bounds for the density cannot be verified, and (iii) the support of the distributions are unknown. It is thus unclear to me how the content of the current paper fits within the previous context."

To be more precise, they evaluate the non-negativity of the fourth-order Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor associated to the transport cost, which has been proved to be a sufficient condition to establish the continuity of the Monge transport map under proper conditions on the marginals of the transport plan. In this work, they consider three versions of this non-negativity condition, previously considered by related works. Their method consists in reformulating the MTW condition (for each of the three versions) into a sum-of-squares program defined on a semialgebraic setvia Putinar's Positivstellansatz, which can then be solved with efficient software. In particular, their approach assumes that the transport cost (or at least the corresponding MTW tensor) is a rational function defined over a two-state semialgebraic space (or at least, a two-state space that contains a semialgebraic space). They apply their framework to verify if the transport cost verifies the MTW condition or to find the largest semialgebraic set on which the transport cost verifies the MTW condition. They propose several convincing numeric experiments in small dimension for a large variety of non-trivial transport costs."
