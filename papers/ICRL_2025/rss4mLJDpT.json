    "title": "SBGC: Bidirectional Graph Comparison-Based Self-Supervised Network for Change Detection in Heterogeneous Images",
    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) in heterogeneous images is a hot but highly challenging topic in the field of remote sensing. However, the significant imaging differences and varying visual appearances of heterogeneous images complicate the accurate detection of changes occurring on the land surface through direct comparison. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a self-supervised network based on bidirectional graph comparison (SBGC) for unsupervised heterogeneous CD, which exploits modality-independent structural relationships. First, pseudo-Siamese networks are established to extract discriminative and robust features from bi-temporal heterogeneous images based on self-supervised contrastive learning. Then, these learned features are utilized to construct graph structures that represent structural relationships. Second, we introduce bidirectional graph comparison to fully exploit the graph structures for exploring comprehensive change information. Specifically, we map the graph structures to their opposite image modality and perform a bidirectional comparison between the original and mapped graph structures to generate a difference image. Finally, the change map is obtained by applying the Otsu segmentation algorithm to the difference image. Experimental results on three public heterogeneous datasets with different modality combinations show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to seven state-of-the-art methods, achieving the best performance with an average overall accuracy of 96.69%.",

A sensitivity analysis on the threshold parameter T would provide more insights into its effect on the final results.\n2. The authors only state that SSL can extract better features, but they do not compare this with traditional non-self-supervised methods (e.g., networks trained without SSL) in terms of feature quality. A comparison based on feature representation quality (such as classification accuracy or clustering performance) would more strongly support the superiority of SSL in feature extraction.\n3. Although the authors assert that SSL can extract more representative features, they do not include feature visualizations (such as t-SNE or UMAP) to show the difference in feature distribution before and after SSL. Providing visualizations of feature space could more clearly illustrate the improvements SSL brings to feature representation, making the claim more convincing.\n4. The BGC is a central innovation of the method, but the ablation experiment only evaluates it by completely removing the entire module. This approach overlooks the impact of each stage within BGC, such as the difference between one-way and bidirectional comparisons or the specific mapping strategies in graph construction. By gradually removing or altering parts of the BGC (e.g., using only one-way comparison or changing the graph mapping method), the paper could provide a more nuanced understanding of how each element contributes to the model's overall effectiveness."
