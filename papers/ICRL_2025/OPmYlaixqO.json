    "title": "SIFM:  A Foundation Model for Multi-granularity Arctic Sea Ice Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Arctic sea ice performs a vital role in global climate and has paramount impacts on both polar ecosystems and coastal communities. \nIn the last few years, multiple deep learning based pan-Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) forecasting methods have emerged and showcased superior performance over physics-based dynamical models. \nHowever, previous methods forecast SIC at a fixed temporal granularity, e.g. sub-seasonal or seasonal, thus only leveraging inter-granularity information and overlooking the plentiful inter-granularity correlations.\nSIC at various temporal granularities exhibits cumulative effects and are naturally consistent, with short-term fluctuations potentially impacting long-term trends and long-term trends provides effective hints for facilitating short-term forecasts in Arctic sea ice.\nTherefore, in this study, we propose to cultivate temporal multi-granularity that naturally derived from Arctic sea ice reanalysis data and provide a unified perspective for modeling SIC via our Sea Ice Foundation Model. \nSIFM is delicately designed to leverage both intra-granularity and inter-granularity information for capturing granularity-consistent representations that promote forecasting skills. \nOur extensive experiments show that SIFM outperforms off-the-shelf deep learning models for their specific temporal granularity.",

                "value": "The paper proposes to combine different temporal aggregations of image time series (daily, weekly and 6 months averages, called granularities) as inputs for a transformer architecture, in order to model Sea Ice Concentration (SIC). The paper proposes to forecast the SIE at all the granularities as well. The argument is that these different granularities will inform the model of the different short-, and medium-term temporal dynamics (sub-seasonal and seasonal variations), without explicitly modeling them."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "## \"Foundation\" model\n\nThe term foundation model feels very misplaced in this paper, and more like a term added as an afterthought because of the current trends in the deep learning community.\nGenerally, foundation models are models considered to be trained on a very large amount of data, and not for a particular task. The model is then being fine tuned on different down-stream tasks for particular applications. This is not the case here, as the model is not trained on multiple tasks, but rather trained to predict multiple granularities, which is one task. Additionally, the model is suited for this particular task, but could hardly be applied to something different, given the specificity of the application.\n\nThe paper reads as if, initially, the letter \"F\" in Sea Ice Foundation Model, was supposed to be \"Fusion\", but then changed last minute to follow a trend. The model is never argued as a foundation model, and save for the name, the term is never used. The concept of fusion on the other hand, is largely covered and mentioned multiple times throughout the paper.\n\nI would strongly suggest changing Foundation to Fusion.\n\n## Related Work\n\nLine 137: \"temporal information inherent in sea ice modeling can not be fully exploited\". I would argue that LSTM combined with CNNs can actually extract the spatio-temporal information quite well. Maybe not particularly in Sea Ice modeling, but in other fields there is a slue of models making use of the spatio-temporal information, be it transformers or combined LSTM/CNN architectures (c.f. Yu et al. 2024, Giezendanner et al. 2023, Boulila et al. 2021, etc...).\n\n## Temporality\n### Terms\nThe temporalities are a bit all over the place. With a paper like this, where the temporal resolution is central to understanding the work, I feel like the wording is particularly important.\nLine 186 explains the granularities relatively well: daily, weekly average, and monthly average. But after that, the terms get a bit muddy:\n- Line 174: \"7 days, 8 weeks\u2019 averages and 6 months\u2019 averages\". My understanding is that these are the time steps. You take 7 days of daily data as input, 8 weeks of weekly average and 6 month of monthly average. Just reading the figure, this is not clear, and I had to piece this together from the text.\n- Line 245: \"We propose to jointly model three granularities that cover sub-seasonal to seasonal scale, i.e., 7 days, 8 weeks averages, and 6 months averages\". Here the confusion is quite big. Area you taking 8 time steps of weekly average, or an average over 8 weeks? Same for month. I think I got the gist, but this is far from clear and I had to go over the paper multiple times to piece it together.\n- Table 1 (line 358): Here it gets worse. Lead Times: 7 days (daily). Intuitively I read this as the 7 days lead time, temporal resolution of 1 day, i.e. the values of the 7th day. But I'm not sure this is right, since you mention you forecast at all time steps, so is the result the error of the 7th day, or the cumulative/average error over the 7 days? Same comment for 8 weeks and 6 month.\n\nI think the paper would profit a lot from a figure describing the temporalities. Show exactly what the inputs and outputs are, and how you define the terms used in the rest of the paper.\n\n### Number of Time steps per granularity\n\nI might have missed it, but it is unclear to me if the number of time steps per granularity is justified anywhere.\nWhy take only the seven next days? Why not the 6 months of daily inputs as a whole? The multi-granularity approach probably makes the model lighter, but a model with 6 month of daily inputs could very well perform as well as the multi-granularity one.\nAlternatively, one could also model the daily output, with a moving window, and average over the other other granularities.\n\n## Dataset\n\nIt is not totally clear to me, from section 4.1, how big the dataset is. A rough estimation of the daily data from 1978 to 2013 for the training data yields ~13'000 training samples), but how were the different temporalities sampled? Is there a moving average? Does that mean the validation set has 365 points (assuming 6 months at the begining and the end have to be blocked for the monthly average)? And the test set 2,555?\n\n## Results\n\nTable 1: The results for the 7 days daily lead time are better, but almost seem marginal. The table is missing units, but assuming it's percentage, is a difference in RMSE of 0.0061 really significant?\nThe comparisons to 45 Days and 90 Days are hard without having the output of the model. Would it be possible to run the model with 45 and 90 days of daily inputs to compare?\nAdditionally, an ablation study on the number of time steps per granularity would be interesting.\n\nThe results on the 6 months seem more significant.\n\nThe ablation study \"Effectiveness of multi-granularity representation\" is interesting, but it would also be interesting to see the results for a single granularity aggregated on the other granularity. For example: daily forecast, aggregated over 6 months.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe conclusion is very minimal, and would profit from a bit more of a discussion. What advancements do the results of this model bring?\n\n## Minor comments\n\nLine 44 and 131: \"However, numerical and statistical models usually rely on high-performance computing on CPU clusters and often lead to complex debugging processes and uncertain parameterization\" and \"tend to result in complex debugging processes and uncertain parameterization\". That might be true, nevertheless Deep learning methods can also have large debugging processes as well as uncertain parameterizations.\n\n## Grammar comments\n\nLine 144: move \"while\" to the beginning of the sentence.\nLine 146: remove \"in the vision community\"\n\n## Comments on figures\n\nLine 063: \"(a)\" should be bold\nLine 173: It would be helpful to have the numbers mentioned in the caption reflected in the figure (e.g. (1), shared spatial encoder, (2), ... (3), ...)\n\nFigure 6: set the value of 0 to the middle, make sure it is on the white part, and set the limits of the color bar to be the same up and down.\n\nFigure 7: use a shared x axis for each column, and a shared y axis for each line"

There is limited exploration of the specific oceanographic and climate science features that influence these predictions. \n    \n3.After the spatial feature encoding, the model applies linear mapping to weekly and monthly features for the alignment of multi-granularity tokens. This approach may disconnect the temporal context of these tokens, raising concerns about whether time series information is preserved and how different granularity tokens are interpreted within the attention mechanism.\n    \n4.Although the paper includes thorough ablation studies, the comparative experiments are insufficient. The authors use many performance metrics from the original papers without providing comparisons based on the new metrics introduced. Some methods are not evaluated within a unified framework, particularly regarding daily versus varying time frames (e.g., 7, 45, 90 days), and there is a lack of comparisons at the weekly granularity.\n    \n5.There exists some typos confusing the understanding. For example, the abstract contains a misstatement regarding \"inter-granularity,\" which should be \"intra-granularity.\"\n    \n6.The direct flattening of features obtained from the spatial encoder raises questions about potential loss of spatial correlation information in vertical dimension, as neighboring features may lose their adjacency relationships after flattening."

Notably, the incorporation of multi-scale temporal data (daily and weekly) has been widely studied and should be properly cited to situate this work within prior research.\n\nThe contributions outlined in the manuscript are not yet robust enough for a top-tier submission. The first and second contributions essentially address similar aspects and should be consolidated into a single point, leaving only two clear and distinct contributions overall.\n\nThe concept of \"independent spatial tokenization\" requires further clarification. Specifically, what distinguishes this from existing spatial processing techniques needs to be articulated. The authors claim in line 123 that previous models utilize 2D convolutions to extract spatial features, which could also be seen as a form of spatial tokenization since patches are independently processed using a shared kernel. This raises the question of what makes the current approach distinct.\n\nThe naming conventions and visual representations between Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b) should be unified for consistency. In Figure 2(a), \"channel-wise fusion\" is implemented with a 2D CNN and functions as the spatial encoder, aligning it with the spatial encoder in Figure 2(b). Additionally, while U-Net is an approach for modeling both spatial and sequential correlations, the alternative is presented conceptually as the \"sequential modeling\" and \"spatial decoder\" in Figure 2(b). This lack of consistent terminology leads to confusion regarding the model architecture.\n\nThe chosen baselines are not representative of recent advancements in time series forecasting. Several are outdated (published in 2021) or lack competitiveness, as indicated by their publication in less recognized venues.
