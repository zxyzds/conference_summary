    "title": "ConcreTizer: Model Inversion Attack via Occupancy Classification and Dispersion Control for 3D Point Cloud Restoration",
    "abstract": "The growing use of 3D point cloud data in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has raised serious privacy concerns, particularly due to the sensitive information that can be extracted from 3D data. While model inversion attacks have been widely studied in the context of 2D data, their application to 3D point clouds remains largely unexplored.\nTo fill this gap, we present the first in-depth study of model inversion attacks aimed at restoring 3D point cloud scenes. Our analysis reveals the unique challenges, the inherent sparsity of 3D point clouds and the ambiguity between empty and non-empty voxels after voxelization, which are further exacerbated by the dispersion of non-empty voxels across feature extractor layers. \nTo address these challenges, we introduce ConcreTizer, a simple yet effective model inversion attack designed specifically for 3D point cloud data. ConcreTizer incorporates Voxel Occupancy Classification to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels and Dispersion-Controlled Supervision to mitigate non-empty voxel dispersion.\nExtensive experiments on widely used 3D feature extractors and benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate that ConcreTizer concretely restores the original 3D point cloud scene from disrupted 3D feature data. \nOur findings highlight both the vulnerability of 3D data to inversion attacks and the urgent need for robust defense strategies.",

The unique challenges in 3D point cloud inversion, such as the inherent sparsity of the data and the ambiguity between empty and non-empty voxels after voxelization have been identified.  The authors address these challenges by incorporating two key techniques: Voxel Occupancy Classification (VOC) to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels, and Dispersion-Controlled Supervision (DCS) to mitigate the dispersion of non-empty voxels across feature extractor layers. Evaluations on widely used 3D feature extractors and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ConcreTizer in restoring original 3D point cloud scenes.  This work highlighted the vulnerability of 3D data to inversion attacks."

The proposed ConcreTizer appears to be novel, designed to tackle the unique challenges associated with 3D point cloud inversion.  \u00a0 \n\nThe paper is well-written with a clear and concise explanation of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The experiments are comprehensive and well-designed, demonstrating the effectiveness of ConcreTizer across various datasets and 3D feature extractors.  \u00a0 \n\nThe findings of this paper have significant implications for the privacy and security of 3D point cloud data. The authors demonstrate that 3D data is vulnerable to inversion attacks, even when shared in the form of intermediate features.  This highlights the urgent need for robust defense strategies to protect sensitive information in 3D data. The proposed ConcreTizer method serves as a valuable tool for assessing the effectiveness of such defense strategies."

                "value": "While the paper emphasizes the need for defense strategies, it only briefly explores the use of Gaussian noise addition as a potential defense mechanism.  A more in-depth investigation of various defense strategies, including their effectiveness and limitations, would further strengthen the paper's contribution. \u00a0For example, I would recommend exploring adversarial training, differential privacy, or feature obfuscation techniques. I would recommend an analysis of the trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation in these defense mechanisms.\n\nConcreTizer method is specifically designed for voxel-based feature extractors.  While these extractors are commonly used in autonomous vehicles, exploring the applicability of the method to other types of 3D feature extractors, e.g., point-based and graph-based would help broaden its scope and impact. \u00a0 I recommend discussing how the key components of ConcreTizer (VOC and DCS) might need to be adapted for point-based or graph-based extractors, and highlight challenges they anticipate in extending the method to these architectures.\n\nWhile the paper discusses the potential privacy risks associated with 3D point cloud data, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the real-world implications of these risks. This could include specific examples of how restored 3D scenes could be used to compromise privacy or security.  I also recommend the authors to provide concrete examples of privacy breaches that could occur with restored 3D scenes, such as identifying individuals, revealing sensitive infrastructure details, or inferring behavioral patterns. It's useful to discuss potential legal or ethical implications of these privacy risks in the context of autonomous vehicles and smart cities."

In the Introduction section, Lines 71-72, the authors just demonstrated that conventional attacks failed, however, the authors did not provide more insights behind this phenomenon. A detailed explanation will help us get a better understanding of the reason why the proposed attack is effective.\n\n2.Limited scope of proposed attacks. The authors said that, \"we delve into the phenomena that arise when the voxel-based feature extractors handle 3D point cloud scenes\", however, not all point cloud networks need to realize voxelization during feature extracting [1]. Therefore, it seems that the first challenge cannot represent the majority point cloud inversion attack scenes, limiting the effectiveness scope of the proposed attack scheme.\n\n3.I encourage the authors to conduct more experiments to make results more convincing, since the page limit is 10 in ICLR 2025, providing enough space to demonstrate more results. For instance, the authors are supposed to employ more 3D point cloud datasets (which may not only focus autonomous driving datasets)\n\n4.More defense baselines are supposed to be used for evaluation. Many recent works about point cloud adversarial attacks [2-4] have  employed  popular defense schemes like random 3D data augmentations, SOR, and SRS to evaluate the point cloud attack scheme's robustness. Thus, I will appreciate it if the authors can provide more results about defense evaluations.\n\n[1] Dynamic graph cnn for learning on point clouds.
