    "title": "GPS: A Probabilistic Distributional Similarity with Gumbel Priors for Set-to-Set Matching",
    "abstract": "Set-to-set matching aims to identify correspondences between two sets of unordered items by minimizing a distance metric or maximizing a similarity measure. Traditional metrics, such as Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Mover\u2019s Distance (EMD), are widely used for this purpose but often suffer from limitations like suboptimal performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, or high computational costs - or both. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective set-to-set matching similarity measure, GPS, based on Gumbel prior distributions. These distributions are typically used to model the extrema of samples drawn from various distributions. Our approach is motivated by the observation that the distributions of minimum distances from CD, as encountered in real world applications such as point cloud completion, can be accurately modeled using Gumbel distributions. We validate our method on tasks like few-shot image classification and 3D point cloud completion, demonstrating significant improvements over state of-the-art loss functions across several benchmark datasets. Demo code is included in the supplementary file.",

The proposed similarity metric leverages Gumbel distribution as a prior to model k-NN across sets. This formulation makes the proposed similarity metric more robust to outliers compared to other similarity metrics like Chamfer Distance while being significantly more efficient to compute compared to robust metrics like Chamfer Distance. \n\nThe proposed similarity metric is applied to model objective functions for two problem settings: few-shot classification, point-cloud completion. The proposed metric outperforms other metrics across all evaluations and is similar to Chamfer Distance in runtime."

                "value": "While I agree about the use of EVT or Gumbel distribution to tackle problems that require modeling extrema (minimum or maximum) of matching scores, I disagree with the use of particularly using the Gumbel distribution only. Here are the specific concerns:\n\n1. According to EVT, the distribution that generally models the extrema (minima or maxima) is the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution; the Gumbel distribution is a special case of the GEV distribution. Thus, it is possible that for some problems the Gumbel distribution is not the appropriate one and thus it can affect performance. Note however that EVT in general can only be applied when the number of scores is large, otherwise, the theory and thus the distributions of EVT (including Gumbel) cannot be applied, strictly speaking. This is something that I think the paper is not exploring nor stating.\n\n2. While it is true that Gumbel can model minima or maxima, it is not true that it can model order statistics. In other words, I think the narrative of the paper is correct only when it states that it models minima or maxima when comparing entities of a set. However, the Gumbel distribution cannot model order statistics, i.e., statistics of the 2nd, 3rd, or Kth scores. Given this, I find concerning that the paper uses it to model the k-th nearest neighbors using a mixture of Gumbel distributions (lines 200 - 203). EVT only models the minima or maxima, but not the order statistics. I don't see a justification in the paper describing rigorously the use of Gumbel distribution in this case. Unless, the introduction of $\\delta$ as shown in line 232 compensates for that. But unfortunately the paper does not justifies this well.\n\n3. The paper is missing prior work exploring EVT to model minima/maxima in matching procedures. Thus, I think the narrative overstates that this is the first work using statistical information for set-to-set matching. See references shown below. \n\n4. Incomplete experiments. While I think the applications used in the experiments are diverse, I think the experiments would've been more informative and more convincing if they could show that other models (e.g., a transformer, or CLIP) also benefit from the proposed GPS.\n\nReferences:\n1.

This theoretical incompleteness may affect the reliability and universality of the method.\n\nThe experiments are mainly focused on a few common image classification and point cloud completion datasets. Although these datasets are representative, they cannot fully cover all possible application scenarios and data distributions.\n\nAlthough the paper claims that the GPS method has achieved better results than some existing methods in the experiment, a careful observation of the experimental data shows that in most cases, the performance improvement is relatively small. For example, the accuracy improvement on some datasets may be only a few percentage points, which may not be significant in practical applications, especially considering the additional computational cost and model complexity that may be introduced."
