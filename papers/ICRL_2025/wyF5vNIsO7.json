    "title": "Scalable Universal T-Cell Receptor Embeddings from Adaptive Immune Repertoires",
    "abstract": "T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune system, targeting infections, cancers, and allergens with specificity encoded by their T cell receptors (TCRs), and retaining a memory of their targets. High-throughput TCR repertoire sequencing captures a cross-section of TCRs that encode the immune history of any subject, though the data are heterogeneous, high dimensional, sparse, and mostly unlabeled. \nSets of TCRs responding to the same antigen, *i.e.*, a protein fragment, co-occur in subjects sharing immune genetics and exposure history. Here, we leverage TCR co-occurrence across a large set of TCR repertoires and employ the GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)  algorithm to derive low-dimensional, dense vector representations (embeddings) of TCRs. We then aggregate these TCR embeddings to generate subject-level embeddings based on observed *subject-specific* TCR subsets. Further, we leverage random projection theory to improve GloVe's computational efficiency in terms of memory usage and training time. Extensive experimental results show that TCR embeddings targeting the same pathogen have high cosine similarity, and subject-level embeddings encode both immune genetics and pathogenic exposure history.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The biological definitions presented in the study are somewhat unclear. For instance, when the authors refer to TCR embedding, it is important to specify whether they mean both the TCR alpha and beta full chains, the CDR3 regions of both chains, or only the CDR3 region of the TCR beta chain. Additionally, do the authors take into account V(D)J gene information when using the CDR3 region?\n\nGiven that TCRs are highly cross-reactive, the authors need to provide further explanation on why using co-occurrence information alone is effective for TCR embedding.\n\nThe repertoires of different subjects contain varying numbers of TCRs. How do the authors address this variability when representing them with a matrix of the same TCR dimensionality?\n\nConsidering the high cross-reactivity of TCRs, how do the authors define the TCR-level ground truth without relying on wet-lab-based experiments?\n\nWhen discussing classification tasks, it would be helpful to clarify whether the focus is on receptor-level classification or repertoire-level classification. Furthermore, given different receptors have clone frequencies within the repertoire, it appears that the authors do not consider clone frequency in their repertoire-level embedding.\n\nThe interpretation of deep learning models is crucial for clinical applications; however, the authors have provided limited results in this area.\n\nLastly, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art works such as DeepTCR, TCRAI, DeepAIR, and DeepRC, which should be addressed."

It is important for the authors to clarify how the cut-off points for these metrics were determined, as this information is crucial for understanding the model's performance and its clinical applicability."

The main idea is to leverage the co-occurrence patterns of TCRs that target the same antigen to learn meaningful representations. To address the computational challenges of large-scale TCR data, the authors introduce the JL-GLOVE method, which combines GloVe with random projection theory. This approach improves memory efficiency and speeds up the training process. They then aggregate these TCR embeddings to generate subject-level embeddings, providing a low-dimensional representation of an individual's immune history. The embeddings show that TCRs targeting the same antigen exhibit high cosine similarity, and aggregated repertoire embeddings correlate with immune profiles, supporting disease prediction and HLA inference tasks. Results demonstrate the utility of these embeddings for predictive modeling and potential applications in personalized medicine by integrating them with other data modalities."

While this comparison is useful, the paper could benefit from a broader comparison with other immunology-focused embedding techniques, such as contrastive learning methods or graph-based embeddings, which may capture additional biological context.\n\n- The paper relies primarily on a mean pooling approach for aggregating TCR embeddings at the repertoire level, which, while straightforward, may be overly simplistic. This method is prone to noise, especially as the number of TCRs (K) increases, potentially limiting classification performance for diseases with more subtle immune signatures."

The authors can include a more comprehensive comparison with other deep learning models specifically designed for TCR repertoire analysis (DeepTCR, DeepID etc).\n\n- The authors observe that the disease classification performance is sensitive to the embedding dimension (d) and the number of TCRs (K). A more systematic exploration of the impact of these parameters can be done A more detailed analysis of the impact of different embedding dimensions across various dataset sizes would be valuable.This would aid other researchers in configuring JL-GLOVE for datasets of different sizes or resolutions, thereby increasing the framework\u2019s accessibility and practical utility.\n\n- Presenting one or two practical case studies where JL-GLOVE embeddings provide actionable insights in a real-world immunological context (e.g., identifying rare disease signatures) would further emphasize the method\u2019s applicability."

The method leverages TCR co-occurrence across patient repertoires, adapting the GloVe algorithm from natural language processing while incorporating the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform for computational efficiency. TCRs are embedded such that those targeting the same pathogen have similar vector representations, and patient repertoires are represented by averaging their constituent TCR embeddings. The resulting embeddings successfully encode both immune genetics (HLA types) and pathogen exposure history, improving as more data is added, and outperform baseline methods on disease prediction tasks. The authors demonstrate their method's scalability and interpretability, showing it can process millions of TCRs while maintaining performance, though they note that the simple averaging approach for patient-level representations could be improved. By creating these biologically meaningful representations, the work provides a foundation for quantifying immune system similarity between individuals and could assist in personalized medicine applications."
