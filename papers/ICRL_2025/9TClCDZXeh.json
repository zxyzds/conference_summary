    "title": "Differentiable and Learnable Wireless Simulation with Geometric Transformers",
    "abstract": "Modelling the propagation of electromagnetic wireless signals is critical for designing modern communication systems. Wireless ray tracing simulators model signal propagation based on the 3D geometry and other scene parameters, but their accuracy is fundamentally limited by underlying modelling assumptions and correctness of parameters. In this work, we introduce Wi-GATr, a fully-learnable neural simulation surrogate designed to predict the channel observations based on scene primitives (e. g., surface mesh, antenna position and orientation). Recognizing the inherently geometric nature of these primitives, Wi-GATr leverages an equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer that operates on a tokenizer specifically tailored for wireless simulation. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks (i. e., signal strength and delay spread prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction) and find that Wi-GATr is accurate, fast, sample-efficient, and robust to symmetry-induced transformations. Remarkably, we find our results also translate well to the real world: Wi-GATr demonstrates more than 35% lower error than hybrid techniques, and 70% lower error than a calibrated wireless tracer.",

                "value": "The paper presents a learnable approach to tackle the problem of indoor wireless simulation. The proposed architecture is based on a Geometric Algebra Transformer, and a new tokenizer is introduced, allowing to leverage a 3D representation of the scene by taking 3D primitives as input. The model can also be integrated into an inverse problem framework based on diffusion, allowing to retrieve the position of the transmitter, the receiver or the geometry of the scene. Two new datasets for wireless simulation are also presented. Experiments are conducted in synthetic and real settings."

Additionally, the explanations of probabilistic inference with diffusion models on Page 5 are inconsistent with the discussion of diffusion models on Page 13, as the diffusion models used do not seem to follow the standard DDPM framework. The authors should include the training and sampling algorithms for the diffusion model utilized, as well as discuss the model's input.\n\n(3) It would be beneficial to compare the proposed method on public datasets and with other models related to channel prediction, such as NeRF and diffusion models.\n\n(4) Regarding generalization, the authors primarily validate their approach on two different datasets. It would be helpful to consider cross-dataset scenarios to assess performance in unseen conditions. Additionally, the authors should discuss the impact of parameters, such as varying simulated frequencies and the number of paths, on prediction performance.\n\n(5) The authors should proofread the paper to correct typographical errors, such as \u201cThe The Tx and Rx locations are sampled uniformly within the bounds of the floor layouts.\u201d"
