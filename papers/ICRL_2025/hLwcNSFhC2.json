    "title": "SAGEPhos: Sage Bio-Coupled and Augmented Fusion for Phosphorylation Site Detection",
    "abstract": "Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods, notably achieving almost 10% and 12% improvements in prediction accuracy and AUC-ROC, respectively. We further demonstrate our algorithm's robustness and generalization through stable results across varied data partitions and significant improvements in zero-shot scenarios. These results underscore the effectiveness of constructing a larger and more precise protein space in advancing the state-of-the-art in phosphorylation site prediction.",

                "value": "This work aims at phosphorylation site prediction. While the problem of detecting phosphorylation sites is possible through high-throughput experimental techniques such as mass spectrometry, predicting phosphosites for a speicific kinase is still a relevant computational problem as detecting kinase-substrate associations is more difficult.  The work presents SAGEPhos. The contribution of this method is that as opposed to traditional methods that rely solely on sequence information, SAGEPhos  leverages both kinase sequence and structural information. SAGEPhos combines these modalities through gated fusion strategies. The inter-fusion and intra-fusion strategies aim at capturing information on different modalities for both kinase and the substrate. The paper reports a 12% improvement in AUC-ROC compared to other methods."

                "value": "- The main weakness of the paper is in the presentation. Many critical experimental details lack clarity which I listed in the questions:\n-  The main contribution of the paper is adding structural information to the model. A comparison to a structure-aware protein language is missing. For example, how would SaProt perform on this task? \nThe paper claims zero-shot generalization but only demonstrates this on a single kinase. The zero-shot experiments could be more comprehensive. Additionally, a zero-shot classifier for kinases, DeepKinZero (Deznabi et al. 2020), exists, but the authors did not discuss its relevance to their work.\nAuthors should also discuss in the report how performance changes across different kinases. Are certain kinases easier to predict than others? Is the kinase-specific performance related to the number of substrates associated with each kinase? \n\n- The discussion section could be strengthened. For example, MusiteDeep's performance in cold-start cases, achieving only 6.4% AUPRC or 0.8% AUPRC, should be mentioned. Also, the authors use AlphaFold structures. Using PDB structures whenever available would make more sense, filling in only missing ones with AlphaFold predictions. Authors should at least acknowledge this and discuss the potential biases it could lead to."

                "value": "- It is unclear how the cold-start and warm-start experiments are designed. The cited reference does not include this information either, which is critical to assessing the results.\n\n- The negative example selection procedure is not clearly described. The authors state: \u201cFor each kinase, we selected an equal number of negative samples from substrate sequences lacking explicit evidence of catalysis by that kinase, resulting in a balanced 1:1 ratio of positive to negative \u201c Are negative sequences chosen from other positions within the same substrate of the kinase, or the entire substrate set across all kinases? Are these positions known phosphosite locations on other substrates, or are they potential sites that could accept a phosphate group without a reported kinase association? Clarifying this distinction is important, as each case poses a different level of classification difficulty.\n\n- The paper combines three different datasets, removing redundant information. When splitting the train/test folds, is substrate similarity or kinase similarity taken into account?\n\nSome other  technical details are missing, which will make it difficult to reproduce the work:\n\n\n-ESM2 is used for feature extraction, but the specific ESM2 model size is not specified.\n- How are the conservation scores computed? \n- Which physicochemical properties are used and with what kind of representation? Continuous scale, binarized categories? Figure A1 needs a legend for the color scale.\t\t\t\t\t\n\u201cWe used this data to create a new test set, where substrate-kinase pairs ranked first for CDK17 were treated as positive samples, and those ranked the bottom two were designated as negative samples.\u201d How many substrates are taken from the bottom and the top?"
