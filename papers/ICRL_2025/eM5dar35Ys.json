    "title": "End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control: Real-Time Video to Signal Decisions",
    "abstract": "Efficient traffic management at urban intersections is vital for reducing congestion\nand improving safety. This paper presents MD3DQN, the first End-to-End novel\nreinforcement learning model using surveillance video for real-time traffic signal\ncontrol. The model features two main components: an image reception module,\ncapturing traffic data from cameras positioned on signal poles, and a multi-agent\ndecision module, where each agent manages a traffic phase. These components\nare connected via a bridge module for seamless integration.\n\nOur novel Entropy Attention Mechanism enhances the multi-decision turn-based\ntraffic signal control by leveraging uncertainty and signal phase delays, leading\nto more optimized decisions. Results show MD3DQN improved cumulative reward\nby an average of 85.2% over Fixed-time 40 and 54.4% over DQN-VTP.\nThe entropy mechanism contributed to a 41.8% improvement upon ablation study,\ndemonstrating its impact on faster convergence and better performance.",

                "value": "This paper introduces MD3DQN that aims to optimize traffic light control via deep reinforcement learning. MD3DQN is able to intake raw images from surveillance cameras and output a decision on whether the traffic light should advance to the next state or stay at the current state. The optimization goal is to minimize vehicle stop time and queuing length. The authors innovated the Entropy Attention Mechanism that enhances signal control by factoring in uncertainty and temporal information, which reportedly largely improves decision performance especially under challenging weathers. The author claim MD3DQN achieves lower average stopping time and queue length compared to a fixed-time scheduled traffic light switch and a DQN baseline."

At line 042-043, the author believes an end-to-end solution is more robust but I wonder what additional information can be passed to the RL system? From the weather conditioned experiments I can infer that the additional information might be the visibility induced uncertainty, and your RL system is able to consume this information at decision making. What if such information is provided in a more direct way? For example a visibility score from the image.\n- The methodologies needs more detail, such as what are the image features from the video perception module, a hidden vector or a BEV feature map?\n- The paper needs more clarification on the methods (more on the questions below)."

Do the gradients in the decision module flow back into the image processor?\n- In Section 4.3, the relation between \"ResNet\", \"YoLo\", \"ViT\" is unclear: are these separate methods experimented in your pipeline? If yes, do you produce the same format of image features that are passed to the `bridge`? You mentioned ResNet gives you $\\alpha_{sp}$ and $\\alpha_{tmp}$, what about YoLo and ViT? And how does  $\\alpha_{sp}$ and $\\alpha_{tmp}$ relate to  $F_{sp}$ and $F_{tmp}$ in line 274?\n- Does the subscription `j` refer to another lane set as `i`? Please clarify.\n- In line 194, is the `phase timing distance` the same for all agents at the decision time since you make decision for all agents together? Because at line 145, you mentioned that the model decides every 5 seconds, so is this `phase timing distance` just 5?\n- In line 301, could you clarify how you designed $f_Q$?\n- Line section 5.1, when you pretrain without images, do you still apply the bridge module and the entropy attention mechanism? They seem to be image based.\n- How is the DQN-VTP baseline differ from yours?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of Novelty in Model Design: While the integration of computer vision and reinforcement learning is a promising approach, the model design appears simplistic. The system utilizes only four signal phases and two actions (change or maintain the current state), which may limit its effectiveness in handling the complexities of real-world traffic scenarios. Enhancing the model to incorporate more signal phases and actions could improve its adaptability and performance.\n\n2. Limited Experimental Scope: The experimental validation is conducted in small-scale scenarios, which may not adequately represent the challenges faced in larger, more complex urban environments. Expanding the experiments to include larger and more varied traffic conditions would provide a better assessment of the system\u2019s effectiveness and robustness.\n\n3. Absence of Comprehensive Baselines:The paper does not compare the proposed system with a wide range of established baselines, particularly recent RL-based traffic signal control methods. Notably, including comparisons with methods like FRAP/MPLight approaches would strengthen the evaluation and demonstrate the relative performance of the proposed system.\n\n4. Insufficient Justification for Methodology: The authors do not adequately justify their choice of methodologies or explain how the proposed system improves upon existing techniques. Providing more detailed discussions on the advantages of their approach compared to previous works in the field would enhance the paper's credibility.\n\n5. Limited Use of Advanced Simulation Tools: The experiments rely solely on SUMO for simulation, which, while useful, may not capture the full complexity of real-world traffic conditions. Utilizing more advanced or contemporary simulators could offer richer insights into the system\u2019s performance and scalability."
