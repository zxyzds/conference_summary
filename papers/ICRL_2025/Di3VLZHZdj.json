    "title": "Efficient Fatigue Modeling: Applying Operator Networks for Stress Intensity Factor Prediction and Analysis",
    "abstract": "Fatigue modeling is essential for material-related applications, including design, engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance. Central to fatigue modeling is the computation and analysis of stress intensity factors (SIFs), which model the crack-driving force and are influenced by factors such as geometry, load, crack shape, and crack size. Traditional methods are based on finite element analysis, which is computationally expensive. A common engineering practice is manually constructing handbook (surrogate) solutions, though these are limited when dealing with complex scenarios, such as intricate geometries. In this work, we reformulate SIF computation as an operator learning problem, leveraging recent advancements in data-driven operator networks to enable efficient and accurate predictions. Our results show that, when trained on a relatively small finite element dataset, operator networks --- such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) --- achieve less than 5\\% relative error, significantly outperforming popular handbook solutions. We further demonstrate how these predictions can be integrated into crack growth simulations and used to calculate the probability of failure in small aircraft applications.",

It will be useful to explicitly state the contributions of this work.\n3. Limited complexity of the dataset.
