    "title": "Takin-VC: Zero-shot Voice Conversion via Jointly Hybrid Content and Memory-Augmented Context-Aware Timbre Modeling",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker timbre into an arbitrary unseen one without altering the original speech content. While recent advancements in zero-shot VC methods have shown remarkable progress, there still remains considerable potential for improvement in terms of improving speaker similarity and speech naturalness. In this paper, we propose Takin-VC, a novel zero-shot VC framework based on jointly hybrid content and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling to tackle this challenge. Specifically, an effective hybrid content encoder, guided by neural codec training, that leverages quantized features from pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer is first presented to extract the linguistic content of the source speech. Subsequently, we introduce an advanced cross-attention-based context-aware timbre modeling approach that learns the fine-grained, semantically associated target timbre features. To further enhance both speaker similarity and real-time performance, we utilize a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Additionally, we advocate an efficient memory-augmented module designed to generate high-quality conditional target inputs for the flow matching process, thereby improving the overall performance of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Takin-VC method surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot VC systems, delivering superior performance in terms of both speech naturalness and speaker similarity.",

Given that the output of the task is audio, it would be beneficial to provide some demonstrations either through a demo page or supplementary materials to better showcase the audio results.\n2. Some notations in Sec. 3.1 is not easy to understand and remember, which might hinder the clarity and accessibility of the paper.\n3. In the hybrid content encoder, SSL features are merely quantized, raising concerns about whether the timbre information contained could still potentially leak. The paper notes that PPG features can offer disentangled timbre information for SSL features; therefore, a comparative analysis regarding whether to use PPG or the use of PPG versus the use of more purified semantic information (such as text) is expected to clarify the effectiveness and security of the feature handling. The results of the ablation study can only demonstrate that using PPG is not enough.\n4. The context-aware timbre modeling seems important, while the analysis is relatively inadequate. It would be insightful to investigate what the performance implications would be if only a global timbre embedding from the VP model were used, thereby understanding the significance of local context in timbre adaptation more deeply.\n5. It would be better to explain more about the large-scale dataset and show some examples of this dataset.\n6. The input of the memory module is x_sctt in Figure 4, but according to the description in Sec. 3.2.2, the input of the memory module should be x_ref."

Moreover, with the impressive progress in related tasks such as zero-shot TTS (voice cloning), the potential for further development in zero-shot VC may be constrained.\n2. The novelty of the approach is limited. The Jointly Hybrid Content module is essentially a combination of HybridFormer and WavLM representations, while Context-Aware Timbre Modeling via Cross-Attention is a common technique. Additionally, the Memory-Augmented Timbre Modeling component is a relatively simple block and lacks significant theoretical contributions.\n3. Differences in the training dataset could introduce data bias.\n4. It would be beneficial to compare the proposed model against more recent baselines, such as CosyVoice-VC and Seed-VC. Although I understand that comparing with works from the last few months might be unfair, demonstrating that Takin-VC significantly outperforms contemporaneous methods would showcase its potential.\n5.
