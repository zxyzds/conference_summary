    "title": "Smoothing the Shift: Towards Stable Test-time Adaptation under Complex Multimodal Noises",
    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to tackle distribution shifts using unlabeled test data without access to the source data. In the context of multimodal data, there are more complex noise patterns than unimodal data such as simultaneous corruptions for multiple modalities and missing modalities. Besides, in real-world applications, corruptions from different distribution shifts are always mixed. Existing TTA methods always fail in such multimodal scenario because the abrupt distribution shifts will destroy the prior knowledge from the source model, thus leading to performance degradation.\nTo address this challenging problem, we propose two novel strategies: sample identification with interquartile range **S**moothing and **u**nimodal assistance and **M**utual **i**nformation sharing (SuMi). SuMi smooths the adaptation process by interquartile range which avoids the abrupt distribution shifts. Then, SuMi fully utilizes the unimodal features to select low-entropy samples with rich multimodal information for optimization. Furthermore, mutual information sharing is introduced to align the information, reduce the discrepancies and enhance the information utilization across different modalities. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority over existing methods under the complex noise patterns in multimodal data. Code will be available.",

It remains unclear whether SuMi can generalize to other multimodal datasets, such as image-text pairs. This raises a question of the method\u2019s applicability to vision-language models and other multimodal contexts (e.g., image and point cloud as in MM-TTA[1]).\n2.The proposed sample selection strategy shows promising results in the ablation study. However, comparable sample selection-based approaches (e.g., DEYO, EATA) are not sufficiently compared. A comparison of DEYO/EATA with (IQR + UA) , as well as experiments\ncombining DEYO/EATA and MIS, would provide clearer insights into the distinct benefits of SuMi.\n3.The experiments primarily focus on corruption shifts, but multimodal scenarios often encounter various other types of distribution shifts. Including datasets that reflect shifts beyond corruption could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of SuMi\u2019s robustness.\n4.The paper\u2019s three main components\u2014sample identification with IQR, unimodal assistance, and mutual information sharing\u2014lack a\ncohesive, unified framework. The combination of these techniques appears to address separate aspects of TTA, but the rationale for exclusively selecting these methods is insufficiently articulated. Greater clarity on the connections and unique insights of each\ncomponent could enhance the motivation and provide readers with more convincing reasoning for the proposed approach.\n[1] Shin, Inkyu, et al. \"Mm-tta: multi-modal test-time adaptation for 3d semantic segmentation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022."

Is it truly feasible for this task to occur in real-world application scenarios? See the Questions part for details.\n2. Under real conditions of TTA, the number of modalities is generally more than two. I noticed that the authors discuss a multimodal form in equation (5), but at other times they refer only to a two-modality form. Can these be expanded into a general multimodal setting? Is it possible to validate the effectiveness of the method across multiple modalities in the experiments?\n3. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of the parameters. However, there is no explanation for why the 'Interquartile' form of IQR was chosen. In this specific task, other quantile ranges might yield better results. Additionally, the paper's improvement is limited to gradually smoothing with the number of iterations, which is merely a simple linear process. There is no discussion of a more theoretical or effective smoothing process.\n4. The paper mentions that the selection of hyperparameters (such as $\\mu$) relies on prior information about the dominant modality of the datasets. However, in TTA, we cannot know the prior information of the data. Could this directly impact the performance of the method across different datasets? Is there a more robust hyperparameter-selection mechanism?"

In real-world scenarios, would algorithms truly continue to be utilized under conditions where sensor failures or malfunctions occur? From my perspective, this task appears to resemble a combination of a modality missing and a TTA subtask. The proposed approach seems to specifically address these two subtasks."

Different from previous works, the author consider a much tougher circumstance with both weak and strong OOD samples. Performance of existing methods will inevitably degrade for huge distribution gap. To combat with this gap, the authors introduce the interquartile to smooth the sharp gap. Moreover, unimodal entropy is utilized to suggest rich multimodal information. Since strong OOD may contain missing modality problem, the author further a mutual information sharing strategy to complement the distribution. Experiments on several datasets under various domains demonstrate the performance of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. While I understand the general framework of the method, certain parts seem to lack clarity. For instance, in section 3.2.1, I can learn that the purpose is to select those samples with lower adaptation gap, however, the ranking process for samples is never introduced. In equation 3, vector $h$ is directly used for comparison, but the comparison method\u2014whether by calculating magnitude, norm, or another metric\u2014is not specified. Definition of IQR also lacks clear clarification. Besides, the motivation part (Figure 3) is suggested to be placed in the Intro section, since it's more vivid and persuasive than experiment results (Figure 1). \n2. My main concern about this work is novelty. The method is mainly composed of three parts: interquartile mainly smooth the distribution gap, unimodal entropy selects samples with high quality, and mutual information sharing combats with missing modality. Every part seems to be orthogonal, with no clear interaction between them. Please explain how separate parts benefit each other in detail, or does every part just simply make their own contribution?\n3. While I am mostly ok with the experimental results, I have concern about the setting of the experiment. In my view, missing modality is a more common issue in multimodal circumstances with more than two modalities. Discussing such problem only on simulated datasets with two modalities is somehow narrow. It is suggested for the author to conduct experiments on dataset with more than two modalities."
