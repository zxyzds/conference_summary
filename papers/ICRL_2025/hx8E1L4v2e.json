    "title": "Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs via Adversarial Autoencoder",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is a very important task that has attracted a lot of attention. Many dynamic graph anomaly detection methods are already available, but most of these efforts are based on supervised learning. In the real world, however, it is often difficult to collect large amounts of labelled anomaly data, which is not conducive to the training of these supervised methods and severely reduces their ability to be applied in different dynamic graph anomaly detection scenarios. A novel semi-supervised anomaly detection framework \\textbf{AAEDY}  for the detection of anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is presented in this paper, which improves reconstruction by combining adversarial based on autoencoder, and discriminates whether an edge is anomalous by comparing the original edge to the reconstructed edge in low-dimensional space.  Extensive experiments have been carried out on six real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that \\textbf{AAEDY} can outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in anomaly detection significantly.",

                "value": "The paper presents AAEDY, a semi-supervised framework for anomaly detection in dynamic graphs, designed to mitigate the reliance on labeled anomaly data by training solely on normal instances. It combines an adversarial autoencoder with multi-level encoding techniques to capture spatial and temporal features, using residuals between original and reconstructed edges for anomaly detection. AAEDY demonstrates improved performance over baseline methods across six datasets in terms of AUROC on detecting injected anomalies."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Weaknesses:\n1. Unclear technical contribution: The proposed framework includes multiple modules and, from my perspective, primarily combines known techniques without providing clear insights or justifications. For example, it\u2019s unclear why both a discriminator enforcing the contextual loss to minimise the difference between the inputs and the reconstructions is needed.\n\n2. Practicality of noise-free normal examples: How practical is it to ensure that normal examples are entirely free from noise? The default training set size is 80% and contains only normal data, which may not be very feasible. In general, annotating a handful of normal nodes is practical, but ensuring a large number of nodes are completely noise-free is challenging.\n\n3. Scalability and runtime concerns: The proposed framework includes multiple modules, such as graph-based reconstruction and subgraph sampling, which are prone to limited scalability and long runtime. I believe it is important to discuss these issues in the paper.\n\n4. Evaluation metrics: Although AUROC is used for evaluation, given the scarcity of the anomaly class, it is essential to include complementary metrics that focus on the anomaly class, such as AUPR, to better reflect performance for the anomaly class.\n\n5. Hyperparameter settings: The hyperparameter settings vary significantly across different datasets. The author should clarify how these settings are determined and discuss their sensitivity.\n\n6. Evaluation with realistic anomalies and dataset size: It appears that the anomalies used for evaluation are injected into datasets that lack actual anomalies, which may limit the realism of the results. Incorporating datasets with real-world anomalies would provide a more accurate assessment. Additionally, the datasets used are relatively small in terms of node count. It would be more insightful to evaluate the proposed methods on large-scale graphs.\n\n7. Miscellaneous: (a). Please ensure consistent spacing. There are a few places where words are stuck together such as line 055 and 532. (b). The paper has multiple grammar errors, such as line 250 (Anomalous edge detection\u2026) and line 275 (...does not be able to).\n(c). I\u2019m unable to find the architecture of the autoencoder in the method section. (d). Related works on static GAD only includes works until 2021. There are numerous static GAD works after 2021. (e) In general, the paper is not easy to follow, and the clarity should be further improved for ICLR's standard. (f) It would be better if the authors can provide more information on how the baseline methods are adapted to this normal-only GAD setting."

Although the authors claim to propose three encoding methods, the intuition behind these methods is not clearly articulated. For instance, the importance of equation (3) in the context of anomaly detection is not sufficiently justified, nor is its superiority over existing encoding methods explained. Furthermore, the contributions outlined in the anomaly detection section (Section 3.2) are ambiguous, leaving readers uncertain about the framework's unique aspects. The authors\u2019 claim regarding the addition of an embedding layer does not present significant novelty, and there is a lack of justification for why this approach was chosen or how it enhances the overall framework.\n2-The methodology for generating abnormal data in the experiments is inadequately explained, with no clear introduction found in the main paper or appendix. Since the types of anomalies significantly affect results, the authors should consider employing multiple types of injection methods.\n3-There are several writing issues throughout the paper, such as missing spaces between terms (e.g., \"semi-supervised\" and \"adversarial\" at line 055, \"on\" and \"autoencoder\" at line 055). These typographical errors detract from the overall professionalism of the manuscript and should be addressed in a thorough proofreading process."

In my opinion, the Introduction section does not clearly state the motivation behind this paper, nor does it adequately distinguish the AAEDY method from existing semi-/unsupervised dynamic graph anomaly detection approaches (beyond its suitability for large amounts of labeled anomaly data). Additionally, the challenges encountered in designing the AAEDY model are not discussed.\nW2. The Related Work section lacks a comprehensive connection to current graph anomaly detection methods and omits unsupervised graph anomaly detection approaches based on contrastive learning.\nW3. This graph anomaly detection method, based on diffusion, feels outdated and lacks originality. I do not believe it meets the standards of top-tier conferences like ICLR. The authors might consider submitting to a conference or journal of a slightly lower tier.\nOther Issues\nW4. There are several missing spaces on page two, for example, in the sentence: \u201cIn order to solve the problem that current dynamic graph anomaly detection methods are not very practical,AAEDY, a novel semi-supervisedadversarial proposes andynamic graph anomaly detection framework based onautoencoder, which only uses normal data to train the model.\u201d\nW5.
