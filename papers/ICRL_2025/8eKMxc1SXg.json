    "title": "Exploiting the Kurtosis Concentration Property for Image quality improvement",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have significantly advanced generative AI  in terms of creating and editing naturalistic images. \nHowever, improving the image quality of generated images is still of paramount interest.\nIn this context, we propose a generic kurtosis concentration (KC) loss, which can be readily applied to any standard diffusion model pipeline to improve image quality.  Our motivation stems from the \\emph{projected kurtosis concentration property} of natural images, which states that natural images have nearly constant kurtosis values across different band-pass versions of the image. To improve the image quality of generated images, we reduce the gap between the highest and lowest kurtosis values across the band-pass versions (e.g., Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)) of images. In addition, we also propose a novel condition-agnostic perceptual guidance strategy during inference to further improve the image quality. We validate the proposed approach for three diverse tasks, viz., (1) personalized few-shot finetuning using text guidance, (2) unconditional image generation, and (3) image super-resolution. Integrating the proposed KC loss and perceptual guidance has improved the perceptual quality across all these tasks in terms of FID, MUSIQ score, and user evaluation. Code is provided in appendix.",

                "value": "1. With the advent of AIGC across all forms of professional and user-generated content (UGC), the KC property may not hold for modern databases. This limitation impacts the fundamental application and effectiveness of using a loss function with simple natural image statistical properties, such as KC loss. A detailed discussion on the KC property\u2019s relevance for large-scale UGC-type databases should be discussed.\n\n2. The \"Constant-Kurtosis\" property has long been used in perceptual quality models like DIVINE, NIQE, BRISQUE, and many others. The authors fail to discuss this, and using KC for (perceptual) quality is not novel. This limits the overall contribution of this paper. \n\n3. The effectiveness of KC-loss is questionable:\n(a) In Fig. 1, the highlighted artifact is small, and such artifacts are uncommon in generated images. This may simply be a poor choice of example, training issue, or poor prompting. Similar comments apply to Figs. 4, 5, 18, and 19.\n(b) In Fig. 9, while the authors emphasize some corrected artifacts, more artifacts appear to be introduced. For example, in Fig. 9(b), the right eye is more deformed than in (a), and the region near the left ear shows increased deformation. Overall, there appears to be no significant perceptual quality improvement. Additionally, in Figs. 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 27, there is no perceptual quality difference, raising questions about the effectiveness of KC loss.\n(c) Why are Fig. 4-DB and Fig. 10 (\"A berry bowl with a mountain in the background\") identical? \n(d) If KC-loss improves the SNR, why do the PSNR values in Tables 3, 4, and 5 not show significant improvements compared to FID or MUSIQ?\n\n4. In Fig. 6, there is very little difference between the GD and GD+KC images, and almost no difference between GD+KC and GD+KC+PG. This raises the question: is PG even improving performance? In Fig. 10, is the image shown with KC or KC+PG?\n\n5. Although intuitive, but PG appears to be a forced novelty in the paper. It does not improve the KC-loss results, and very few experimental results are presented. Moreover, it requires two forward passes, making it time-consuming.\n\n6. In Appendix F, the authors do not address a crucial question: if KC-loss only improves  the SNR, why does text-alignment performance decreases?\n\n7. Minor but Necessary Improvements:\n(a) Use high-resolution figures. For instance, In Fig. 1, it is difficult to see the artifacts and corresponding improvements. This applies to Fig. 10 as well.\n(b) In Fig. 1, the authors do not clarify whether the figure is an overview of their method (DiffNat) including PG, or if it only shows KC loss. An overview should include both KC and PG.\n(c) Line 851: Correct \"strat\" to \"start.\""

Overclaiming Contribution Point 2**\n\nThis is the most concerning issue for me.\n\nThe second contribution point, which mentions \"We provide insights on how reducing kurtosis improves image quality,\" is problematic. This contribution corresponds to section 3.1 of the paper, which revisits from the definition of the Kurtosis Concentration Property to its relationship to denoising. However, the content of this section has already been introduced in paper [1]. \n\nFor instance, Definition 1 in section 3.1 corresponds to the first paragraph of section 3 in [1], Lemma 1 corresponds to Claim 1 in [1], and Lemma 2 corresponds to Equation 2  of [1]. Up to Lemma 2, this paper cites previous work including [1] reasonablely. However, when introducing Lemma 2, the paper fails to cite the previous work and introduces potentially misleading content. For example, in line 187, the paper states: \n\"Next, we establish the relation between the projection kurtosis of the noisy version of the image and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio.\", and introduce lemma 2.\nHowever, in reality, Lemma 2 corresponds to Equation 2 in [1].\n\nTherefore, the insights claimed by the authors are not original, leading to an overclaim of contribution. These insights are my favorite part of the paper, but it\u2019s disappointing to discover that they are not entirely novel. This part should even be included in a Section named \"Preliminaries\".\n\n\n\n**2. The Principle Behind the PG Strategy is Unclear**\n\nThe authors heavily promote the PG strategy as being condition-agnostic, but it seems to only aim at further improving image quality. It is unclear why this strategy is introduced. And there seems to be no clear motivation or explanation for why it achieves good results, making this section feel incomplete.\n\n\n\n**3. The Paper's Presentation Needs Improvement**\n\n3.1 **Please Use Vector Graphics:** Many of the figures, such as Figure 1, Figure 6, and others, are not vector graphics, making them blurry and lacking in detail even when zoomed in.\n\n3.2 **Figures Do Not Highlight Method Improvements:** In comparative figures such as Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 9, the advantages in terms of texture detail and diversity can not be clearly observed. Figure 19 in the supplementary materials is clearer in this regard.\n\n3.3 **The Paper\u2019s Structure Could Be Further Optimized:** The structure could be rearranged to improve readability and flow, espefically for section 3.4.\n\n---\n\n[1] Zhang X, Lyu S.
