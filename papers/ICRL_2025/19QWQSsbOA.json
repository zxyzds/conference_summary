    "title": "Multi-scale Conditional Generative Modeling for Microscopic Image Restoration",
    "abstract": "The advance of diffusion-based generative models in recent years has revolutionized state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in a wide variety of image analysis and synthesis tasks, whereas their adaptation on image restoration, particularly within computational microscopy remains theoretically and empirically underexplored. In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.",

Additionally, the roles and relative importance of the scaling parameters \u03bb, \u03bd, and \u03b1 are unclear. \n2. The training procedure for MSCGM is not explicitly described. Unlike the clear training steps outlined for BBDP, MSCGM lacks a step-by-step description of its training pipeline. \n3. While Table 1 compares MSCGM with other models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and sampling time, it does not include training time or the number of trainable parameters for each method. Without these metrics, it is challenging to gauge MSCGM\u2019s overall computational cost relative to other approaches. Including such details would provide a more comprehensive view of the model\u2019s efficiency.\n4. In Section 4.2, the authors state that FID is considered as an evaluation metric. However, this metric is not included in Table 1. As FID is widely used in assessing generative models for image quality, its inclusion would offer further insights into MSCGM\u2019s performance in distributional similarity to real images.\n5. Equations from 4 to 15 are borrowed from BBDP paper. It is better to include them under the Preliminaries section."

The Brownian bridge stochastic process is leveraged to introduce conditional images in both forward and reverse processes. While the authors aim to address microscopic image restoration, the motivation and results in the paper do not consistently support this focus."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Lack of Consistency:** The paper lacks organization and clarity. Although the title emphasizes \"Microscopic Image Restoration,\" the experiments primarily focus on \"Natural Image Super-resolution\" and \"Low-light Natural Image Enhancement.\" Only a small subset of results explores microscopic images. If the model is intended for general image restoration, it would be more accurate to propose it as a \u2018unified image restoration\u2019 model. I suggest the authors either refocus their experiments more heavily on microscopic image restoration to align with the title, or broaden the title to reflect the wider scope of image restoration tasks covered in the paper.\n  \n2. **Introduction Needs Refinement:** The introduction lacks a clear problem definition and research motivation. The first two paragraphs provide a broad overview of diffusion processes that diverges from the paper\u2019s focus. The discussion on latent diffusion downsampling is a well-known issue and could be alleviated by higher resolutions. The authors should clearly articulate why microscopic images especially require the multi-scale wavelet transform in the introduction. Please include a discussion of how their approach compares to or builds upon these existing wavelet-based diffusion models in the Introduction, highlighting any key differences or improvements.\n  \n3. **Lack of Acknowledgment of Prior Work:** The paper does not credit previous studies applying wavelet transforms in diffusion models, which could mislead readers into believing the concept originated here. Papers like \"Wavelet Diffusion Models are Fast and Scalable Image Generators (CVPR 2023)\" and \"Training Generative Image Super-Resolution Models by Wavelet-Domain Losses Enables Better Control of Artifacts (CVPR 2024)\" are directly related and should be cited with comparisons to clarify this study\u2019s contributions.\n  \n4. **Figure 1 Illustration Issues:** The paper title focuses on \"Microscopic Image Restoration,\" yet Figure 1 uses natural images. Including examples of microscopic images to show the degradations introduced by LDM and Refusion compared to MSCGM would enhance clarity.\n  \n5. **Methodology Development Clarity:** The description of the wavelet transform on page 4 is overly general, with key details moved to the appendix. Clear explanations of any novel model designs or algorithmic adaptations should be provided in the main text.\n  \n6. **Quality of Mathematical Presentation:** Symbols in the equations are used without proper declarations or explanations. Inconsistent symbols, like the variable for the normal distribution \\( N \\), further detract from clarity.\n  \n7. **Algorithm 1 Lack of Context:** Algorithm 1 on page 5 is underdeveloped. Symbols are not defined before use, and the algorithm lacks defined input-output requirements.\n  \n8. **Figure 2 Diagram Confusion:** Figure 2 is difficult to interpret. The illustration doesn\u2019t clearly label network modules, workflow processes, or shared parameters (only a line is shown), which fails to clarify the model structure effectively.\n  \n9. **Lack of Dataset Information:** The results section includes evaluations of microscopic images, but there\u2019s no description of the dataset. Is it public or private? What is the image count? Without these details, readers cannot analyze or reproduce the results. Please provide a detailed description of the microscopic image dataset used, including its source, size, and any preprocessing steps applied.\n  \n10. **Insufficient Ablation Studies:** Results provide only a simple comparison with LDM, without deeper exploration of MSCGM\u2019s components or ablation studies to justify the performance benefits of each module.\n  \n11. **Unconvincing Model Performance:** The model\u2019s performance requires further validation through comparison with advanced models. Numerous diffusion-based image restoration models from 2024 exist, yet none are used for comparison. This weakens the paper\u2019s credibility.

For instance, IR-SDE [1] is cited as requiring 100 steps, but the authors use 1000, which significantly prolongs inference time. With the correct configuration (100 steps), the inference time should drop from 32 seconds to approximately 3 seconds.\n\n\u2022 The choice of metrics is limited and somewhat inadequate for a super-resolution task. Relying solely on PSNR and SSIM may overlook important aspects of image quality.

Additionally, the authors showed the near-Gaussian property of low-frequency component and thus employed Brownian Bridge Diffusion Process (BBDP).

Only CMSR (GAN: non-diffusion model), is compared at the moment, not showing the effectiveness of proposed near-Gaussianity assumption.\nSimilarly, applying BBDM to full resolution image does not seem to be fair comparison. Since many works demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-scale diffusion models, BBDM should be implemented in a same manner as the proposed method to prove the superiority of WT instead of other compression technique. Please conduct an ablation study that replaces WT with simple down-sampling.\nIs there any specific reason why the proposed work adopted BBDM which was initially designed for image translation where input and target domains are different?
