    "title": "Morse: Fast Sampling for Accelerating Diffusion Models Universally",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple and universal framework for accelerating diffusion models. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. We validate the efficacy of our method under a variety of experimental setups. Our method shows an average speedup of 1.78\u00d7 to 3.31\u00d7 over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to baseline diffusion models. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis. The code will be made publicly available.",

                "value": "The paper presents a framework for the acceleration of any diffusion model. The kay idea is the use of a dual-model design, that consists of a heavy and a light model. The heavy model in this case is the original diffusion model, where the light one is a similar model but operating in a lower resolution. The approach has been seen in many other fields, but the claim here is that this is the fist time that is applied to diffusion models, and the main challenge was the design of the light model and the decision on the information that it had to consider. This is a heavy experimental paper, where the authors demonstrate in a number of settings the efficacy of their approach."

However the reported overall gains take into account non meaningful FID scores (which is also the case where the proposed method provides the largest gains). I would suggest to focus the reported of the gain to a narrower FID band.\n\nA simple (and faster rectifier) would be a combination of the original model but with a down sampled input followed by an up sampling block. Assign this comparison would add more information about the value that is actually added by the tuning of the new proposed model, given that the demonstrated gains are mainly due to the down sampling of the input. Table 4 and the relevant discussion addresses part of it but a)what about other samplers, and b) how statistical significant are the differences in FID scores?"

                "value": "This paper presents a new methodology for sampling in diffusion models called Morse. It has two components, the first one is the \"Jump Sampling\" which uses different existing samplers to reduce the number of diffusion steps to converge to the generated image. The second component is the use of a smaller and much more efficient \"dot\" model to effectively interpolate between samples, providing residual feedback, leading to faster convergence. The dot model utilizes weight sharing with the main model (dubbed dash) to decrease overall training time. The paper demonstrates the compatibility of their system with multiple existing samplers including DDIM, DDPM, SDE and DPM, showing a speedup, especially in the low FID regime with few steps."

As such, I expected to see (1) and end-to-end implementation of the system showing measured speedup, and (2) some comparison/compatibility with other efficiency techniques. Both of these things are missing from the paper. I realize that the latter (2) may be hard to do comprehenesively, but at least a quantitative comparison to distilled/quantized diffusion models would make sense here. For the first weakness (1) the use of LDM is very confusing to me. Is this measured speed per step? Why not show the end-to-end time for generating an image? I imagine having two models has more room for system-level optimization which might have not been done in this work? The final weakness is that presentation of results which is shown on a log-log scale. I don't think an FID of 320 matters, so a bigger focus on the low FID regime would make more sense. It seems that speedup generally decreases as more time is given to the diffusion process. Is this method useful for high-quality image generation? or is only useful in lower-quality and faster latency regime? I think both are fine but it would be good to clarify the numbers at both extremes."

This combination allows for flexible and efficient image generation without compromising performance.\n\nThe paper situates Morse within the broader context of diffusion models, referencing established samplers like DDPM, DDIM, DPM-Solver, and SDE.

Specifically, a quantitative comparison of the additional training time and memory requirements introduced by the Dot model versus the runtime speedups achieved would be particularly beneficial for readers.\n\n\n2. Are there any plans to release Morse as an open-source project? Open-sourcing it could enhance its impact by allowing the diffusion community to build upon its contributions, fostering collaboration, and broader adoption."
