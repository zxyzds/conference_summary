    "title": "Streaming Algorithms For $\\ell_p$ Flows and $\\ell_p$ Regression",
    "abstract": "We initiate the study of one-pass streaming algorithms for underdetermined $\\ell_p$ linear regression problems of the form\n  $$\n      \\min_{\\mathbf A\\mathbf x = \\mathbf b} \\lVert\\mathbf x\\rVert_p \\,, \\qquad \n      \\text{where } \\mathbf A \\in \\mathbb R^{n \\times d} \\text{ with } n \\ll d \\,,\n  $$\n  which generalizes basis pursuit ($p = 1$) and least squares solutions to\n  underdetermined linear systems ($p = 2$). We study the column-arrival\n  streaming model, in which the columns of $\\mathbf A$ are presented one by one in a\n  stream. When $\\mathbf A$ is the incidence matrix of a graph, this corresponds to an\n  edge insertion graph stream, and the regression problem captures $\\ell_p$\n  flows which includes transshipment ($p = 1$), electrical flows ($p = 2$), and\n  max flow ($p = \\infty$) on undirected graphs as special cases. Our goal is to\n  design algorithms which use space much less than the entire stream, which has\n  a length of $d$.\n\n  For the task of estimating the cost of the $\\ell_p$ regression problem for\n  $p\\in[2,\\infty]$, we show a streaming algorithm which constructs a sparse\n  instance supported on $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n)$ columns of $\\mathbf A$\n  which approximates the cost up to a $(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$ factor, which\n  corresponds to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n^2)$ bits of space in general and\n  an $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n)$ space semi-streaming algorithm for\n  constructing $\\ell_p$ flow sparsifiers on graphs. This extends to $p\\in(1,\n  2)$ with $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{2}n^{q/2})$ columns, where $q$ is the H\\\"older\n  conjugate exponent of $p$. For $p = 2$, we show that $\\Omega(n^2)$ bits of\n  space are required in general even for outputting a constant factor\n  solution. For $p = 1$, we show that the cost cannot be estimated even to an\n  $o(\\sqrt n)$ factor in $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space.\n\n  On the other hand, if we are interested in outputting a solution $\\mathbf\n  x$, then we show that $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximations require $\\Omega(d)$\n  space for $p > 1$, and in general, $\\kappa$-approximations require\n  $\\tilde\\Omega(d/\\kappa^{2q})$ space for $p > 1$. We complement these lower\n  bounds with the first sublinear space upper bounds for this problem, showing\n  that we can output a $\\kappa$-approximation using space only\n  $\\mathrm{poly}(n) \\cdot \\tilde O(d/\\kappa^q)$ for $p > 1$, as well as a\n  $\\sqrt n$-approximation using $\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\log d)$ space for $p = 1$.",

They consider the underdetermined setting $\\min_{Ax=b} \\|x\\|_p$ where $A$ has size $n\\times d$, $n<<d$, receives $d$ column updates. They consider $p\\in [1,\\infty)$. When we consider instances graphs, these updates correspond to edge insertions. \n\nThe first result is an algorithm for \u201cp-norm flow sparsifier\u201d in $O(n^2)$ space which is a general version of graph sparsifiers which minimize the $\\ell_p$-norm. This algorithm follows from using the online lewis weight sampling algorithm of Woodruff and Yasuda\u201922 on the dual problem. The other algorithmic result deals with giving a tradeoff between the size of the sparsifier and objective error when the goal is to maintain the entire solution vector x. The first algorithm only maintains the objective value.\n\nThe paper also presents several information theoretic lower bounds which match these upper bounds. They also give some extra lower bounds for the case of $p=2$."

When $p = 2$, it is the classical linear regression problem and has a closed-form solution $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{A}^\\top (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}^\\top)^{-1} \\mathbf{b}$. The general $\\ell_p$ regression has been well-studied, in particular, when $\\mathbf{A}$ is the vertex-edge incidence matrix, it is the $\\ell_p$-norm flow problem, which corresponds to transshipment, Laplacian solver, and maximum flow if $p = 1, 2$, and $\\infty$ respectively. This paper considers the scenario that the matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ has $n \\ll d$, which leads to the linear system $\\mathbf{Ax} = \\mathbf{b}$ being underdetermined. In this case, it is impractical to store all the $d$ columns of $\\mathbf{A}$, which motivates the usage of the column-arrival streaming model. In addition, there are two kinds of solutions to $\\ell_p$ regression: (1) $\\textit{cost estimation}$ that approximates the optimal $\\ell_p$ norm; (2) $\\textit{vector-valued}$ that approximates the optimal solution $\\mathbf{x}^*$. For the first kind, this paper achieves space complexity $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2} n^{\\ 1+max\\\\{1, p/2(p-1)\\\\}})$, which is $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2} n^2)$ when $p > 2$, and also gives lower bounds for $p = 0, 1, 2$. For the second kind, this paper also provides lower bounds and upper bounds for different values of $p$."

To be specific, when $p = 1$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ is the cost vector, then it is a transshipment problem; when $p = 2$ and $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{r}^{1/2}$, where $\\mathbf{r}$ is the resistance vector, then it is reduced to a Laplacian solver; when $p = \\infty$ and $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{c}^{-1}$, where $\\mathbf{c}$ is the capacity vector, then it is the maximum flow problem.      \n\nBy this formulation, it is the same as formulation (2). As a special case, when $\\mathbf{A}$ is a vertex-edge incidence matrix in the graph streaming problem, there is some existing work (Line 91-97) on transshipment, electrical flow, maximum flow, etc. Could you compare this work with their results?"
