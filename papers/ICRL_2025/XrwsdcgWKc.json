    "title": "Enhancing Variational Quantum Algorithms: Effective Quantum Ansatz Design Using GFlowNets",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises significant computational advantages over classical computing. However, current devices are constrained by a limited qubit count and noise. By combining classical optimization methods with parameterized quantum circuits, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution for noisy intermediate-scale quantum systems (NISQ). This makes VQAs particularly promising strategies for achieving near-term quantum advantages; such approaches are now widely explored for nearly all quantum computing applications. However, designing effective parameterized circuits, also known as ansatz, remains challenging. In this work, we introduce the use of GFlowNets as an efficient method to automate the development of efficient ansatz for various quantum computing problems. Our approach leverages GFlowNets to efficiently explore the combinatorial space of parameterized quantum circuits. Our extensice experiments demonstrate that GFlowNets can discover ansatz with an order of magnitude fewer parameters, gate counts, and depths compared to current approaches for the molecular electronic ground state energy problem. We also apply our approach to the unweighted Max-Cut problem, where we observe similar improvements in circuit efficiency. These results highlight the potential of GFlowNets to significantly reduce the resource requirements of VQAs while maintaining or improving solution quality.",

In Figure 3, the authors only compare to one architecture search algorithm (QDARTS) whose idea was first proposed in arXiv 2010.08561 and a modified version (Wu et al 2023) is published in ICML 2023. The baseline is not strong enough given that there are many quantum architecture search literatures now. \n7.

However, the experiment circuits are relatively small, and the maximum circuit scale is only 10 nodes in the max cut problem. The authors should consider adding larger problems as related research has demonstrated its circuit search with more than 100 qubits (Wang, H., QuantumNAS: Noise-Adaptive Search for Robust Quantum Circuits).\n3.\tThis paper does not take into consideration hardware constraints, including hardware topology and noise, which are crucial to NISQ devices.

However, in Figure 3, the \u201cOurs\u201d method achieves a parameter count smaller than the maximum limit. Does that mean the training process should not stop here, or are certain masks too strict?\n3.\tIn Figure 3, 7, 8, and 9, all circuits achieve a parameter count smaller than the parameter limit set by the training process. Will certain experiments return a circuit which has exactly the number of parameters as the limit? As the problem grows more complicated, can the model always return a circuit that is below the parameter number limit?"
