    "title": "CausalESC: Breaking Causal Cycles for Emotional Support Conversations with Temporal Causal HMM",
    "abstract": "Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) is a rapidly advancing task focused on alleviating a seeker's emotional distress. The intricate interplay between cognition, emotion, and behavior presents substantial challenges for existing approaches, which often struggle to capture the dynamic evolution of the seeker's internal state during conversations. To address this, we propose \\textbf{CausalESC}, a model designed to dynamically represent the seeker's internal states, by assuming that the generative process governing the mutual influence among these factors follows a first-order Markov property, with \\iid random variables. The model comprises a prior network, that disentangles the seeker's emotions, cognition, and behavior, and a posterior network, which decouples the support strategy factors. The prior network also models the psychological causality of the seeker within each conversation round. To account for the varying effects of support strategies on the seeker's intrinsic states, we incorporate a support intervention module to capture these impacts. Additionally, a holistic damping transfer  mechanism is designed to regulate the complex interactions among cognition, emotion, behavior, and strategy, ensuring that changes remain within a reasonable range. Our model effectively breaks causal cycles and achieves causal representation learning. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, emphasizing the advantages of modeling the evolution of the seeker's internal state under support strategies.",

                "value": "This paper proposes CausalESC, a temporal causal hidden Markov model for emotional support conversations that aims to capture the dynamic evolution of seekers' internal states. The key innovation is modeling the mutual influence between cognition, emotion, and behavior as a first-order Markov process with i.i.d. variables, which breaks potential causal cycles into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The model consists of three main components: a dialogue floor encoder, a temporal causal hidden Markov module, and a psychocausal hybrid decoder. The authors claim their approach is the first to learn causal representations within causal loops in emotional support conversations."

                "value": "This paper has several issues that prevent a recommendation for acceptance. Some of these are not uniquely the issue of this paper in itself, but more the eco-system within which the paper is written (ESC). I'll detail more below, but as one example, the opaque reliance on three 'human experts' to examine such tasks seems especially problematic, but is also used in other accepted papers that this paper relies on. Still, this seems like a negative practice such that precedence is not a good guide for it. \n\nIn more detail:\n\n* While the paper makes general contact with psychology and cognitive science, it is superficial at best. Generally pointing at things like 'cognitive behavioral therapy' or 'emotional regulation' ignores most of the work that has been done to actually test, validate, and model these things. I'm exaggerating to make a point, but the situation is similar to trying to model the physics of a situation while ignoring what we know actually about physics, broadly citing a physics textbook, and then throwing an LLM at it that causally connects in a loop variables labeled things like 'friction', 'momentum', and 'heavy-ness' (some of those are indeed professional terms, some are not, and simply connecting them in a DAG doesn't do much). \n\n* Looking at figure 2 for example, how exactly are things like 'emotion, cognition, behavior' actually meant to affect one another? There are huge literatures in computational cognitive science trying to connect these things that go into actual models of them, but here they're all just kind of in a soup together. You would think that 'behavior' would be something like an action variable that is determined by a person's cognitive and emotional state (\"I am hungry, there is an apple over there, I will reach for the apple\") but then the next state should be determined by the behavior as the actual causal variable, why would the state determine the behavior except through its affect on mental states, unless this is meant to be some sort of habit or instinct pathway? \n\n* Continuing that line: The 'damping' module has a specific technical role, keeping the variables within some bound. That's presumably not meant to have a psychological reality, or if it does it is presumably something rather biological. Instead, the authors connect it to 'emotion regulation theory' which has a very specific, tested meaning within psychological and refers to specific strategies people use to either 1) reassess their current situation or 2) tamp down outward behavior expressing their emotion. Instead, the 'damping' is happening over cognition, emotion, behavior broadly without any attempt to model or validate the actual procedure of 'emotion regulation' in the well-accepted meaning of this term. I don't think the authors *should* have to validate that their damping module is in fact implementing something like a re-assessment strategy, there's no reason to expect that it is doing that, but then why call it that and connect it to something it isn't doing? I mention this point on its own but also as example of the overall weakness of the paper in connecting to cognitive/psychological work in general.\n\n* The authors claim as one of the main contributions the unfolding of a causal loop into multi-step MDPs, but this is pretty standard in modeling how agents interact with the world using MDPs and latent mental variables (see e.g the work of Chris Baker and Josh Tenenbaum on inverse planning)\n\n* I appreciate the comparison to multiple other models but it seems like the authors' model basically misses out on nearly all the comparisons. That is, for almost every metric there seems to be a better fit module, the authors mostly write around this rather than facing it head on.\n\n* Probably the most problematic issue in the paper is the actual testing of whether this model does what it is purported to do. In this analysis the authors use 'three experts' but very little detail is provided about this evaluation. Who were these experts? In what way were they experts? What training did they receive and how did they do the evaluation? Were they students from the lab? Colleagues? Naive participants recruited online? Why was the comparison to two models that didn't do that well on the auto-eval instead of the models that did better than the authors model on the auto-eval (e.g. chatGPT)? Presumably if these systems are ever going to be released into the wild the relevant comparison would be to show the dialogs to a large and diverse sample of naive human participants and have them choose the preferred continuation, and not just between models but between models and a natural conversation. Otherwise, the models may do better than one another while existing in a completely closed-loop format that is light-years away from natural dialog. \n\n* I appreciate the use of the examples and test cases but they only highlighted just how subjective the nature of 'expertise' judgement can be here. For example, I personally found the suggestion of the system in Figure 1 to be non-supportive and downright missing the pragmatics of the situation (if a friend told me they were worried about losing their job I might think they're trying to find comfort, and if I were to suggest to them 'hmmm, yeah, better update your resume' they might be taken aback, thinking that I thought they could in fact lose their job). As another example, I didn't find the \"I think you will be surprised at how intelligent a dog can be\" to be some kind of 'affirmative insight' that understands the seeker's 'genuine needs',  nor do I find the previous example to be 'superficial affirmation'; this all feels like reading tea-leaves."
