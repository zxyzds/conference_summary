    "title": "Multivariate Time-series Forecasting with SPACE: Series Prediction Augmented by Causality Estimation",
    "abstract": "The analysis of multivariate time series (MTS) presents a complex yet crucial task with substantial applications in areas such as weather forecasting, policy formulation, and stock market prediction. It is important to highlight three key characteristics of MTS that contribute to the challenging and multifaceted nature of their analysis: (i) their interrelationships are represented through causal relationships rather than mere similarities; (ii) they convey information across multiple independent factors; and (iii) their dynamics often arise from inherent temporal dependencies. While conventional time series analysis frameworks often fail to capture one or more of these aspects, resulting in incomplete or even misleading conclusions, we propose an end-to-end trainable $\\textbf{S}$eries $\\textbf{P}$rediction model $\\textbf{A}$ugmented by $\\textbf{C}$ausality $\\textbf{E}$stimation (SPACE) to address these limitations. This model effectively incorporates temporal dependencies and causal relationships, featuring a temporal embedding and a transfer entropy-based Cross-TE module designed to enhance predictions through causality-augmented mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that SPACE achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging real-world time series prediction tasks, showing its effectiveness and versatility.",

The model shows improved performance across various prediction lengths and datasets, including weather, electricity, and financial data. The authors emphasize that the integration of causal information is essential for improving forecasting performance in complex, real-world time series data. Additionally, they claim that SPACE enhances the interpretability of forecasts, especially on weather-related data, by capturing and visualizing causal relationships between different variables."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Oversimplification of causality: The paper appears to oversimplify the concept of causality and its role in prediction tasks, potentially conflating correlation with causation in some instances. In paragraph 1, the example does not clearly demonstrate direct cause-and-effect relationships. For instance, a sporting event doesn\u2019t directly cause increased electricity usage - it\u2019s correlated with increased usage due to more people using electrical devices to watch the event.\n\n2. Lack of precision in terminology: The use of terms like \u201cdissimilar information\u201d in Figure 1 is vague and doesn\u2019t clearly explain what causal information might be captured that similarity-based approaches miss. In addition, the paper seems to imply that causal approaches are superior to similarity-based approaches in all cases, without providing sufficient evidence for this claim.\n\n3. Overgeneralization: The authors make broad claims in their first contribution about the applicability of their approach to \u201ca large class of time series data\u201d without specifying the types of data or providing adequate evidence.\n\n4. Absence of ablation studies: There\u2019s no mention of ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of specific components, such as the residual connections (line 236-238), on the model\u2019s performance and preservation of time step information.\n\n5. Oversimplification of complex systems: The paper seems to underestimate the complexity of systems like weather (Figure 3), suggesting that simple causal relationships can capture their full complexity.  In this example: Some of the described relationships may be indirect. For example, increased cloud cover associated with precipitation could lead to decreased solar radiation and temperature, rather than the precipitation itself directly causing these changes. In addition, weather systems often involve feedback loops where variables influence each other in complex ways. For instance, increased humidity can lead to more precipitation, which in turn affects humidity levels.\n\n6. Insufficient rigor in establishing causality: The paper doesn\u2019t describe a sufficiently rigorous approach to establishing true causality, which would require consideration of potential mechanisms, controlled experiments (where possible), and careful examination of temporal sequences and potential confounding factors."

                "value": "1. Causality Understanding:\n- How does the paper differentiate between correlation and causation, particularly in the first paragraph's examples?\n- Can we truly claim a direct causal relationship between sporting events and electricity usage, or is this more of a correlation due to viewer behavior?\n2. Terminology Clarity:\n- What specific meaning does \"dissimilar information\" convey in Figure 1?\n- What evidence supports the superiority of causal approaches over similarity-based methods?\n- How are these differences quantified and demonstrated?\n3. Generalizability Claims:\n- What specific types of time series data does this approach effectively handle?\n- What evidence supports the claim of applicability to \"a large class of time series data\"?\n- What are the limitations or boundaries of this approach?\n4. Model Evaluation:\n- How do individual components, particularly the residual connections, contribute to the model's performance?\n- What would ablation studies reveal about the preservation of time step information?\n- Which components are essential versus optional for model success?\n5. System Complexity:\n- How does the model account for indirect relationships in weather systems, such as the cloud cover-precipitation-temperature chain?\n- How are feedback loops and mutual influences between variables handled?\n- Does the model oversimplify complex environmental systems?\n6. Causality Validation:\n- What methods were used to establish true causality rather than correlation?\n- How were potential confounding factors identified and controlled?\n- What role did temporal sequences play in establishing causal relationships?\n- Were controlled experiments or alternative validation methods considered?"

                "value": "1. **Dataset Coverage**: Commonly used datasets, such as *Traffic* and *Electricity*, are missing from the evaluation, limiting the scope of comparison.\n2. **Efficiency Claims**: While SPACE is described as highly efficient, there is no empirical comparison of runtime with established models like iTransformer and DLinear.\n3. **Unverified Claims in Figures**: Figure 1 implies that the attention mechanism only focuses on similar series, a claim not substantiated by experiments or theory.\n4. **Notation and Writing Inconsistencies**: The paper has numerous small errors in notation (e.g., non-italicized symbols) and inconsistent symbol usage, particularly in the methodology section (e.g., line 276 \u201cN\u201d should be italic, lines 274 and 284 should use \u201cP_N,\u201d and line 285 should italicize \u201cT\u201d). Such inconsistencies affect readability and technical accuracy.\n5. **Causal Adjacency Matrix Evaluation**: It is unclear in Figure 3 how the learned adjacency matrix by Cross-TE outperforms traditional attention in identifying causal relationships. Figure 1 claims attention ignores dissimilar information, yet Figure 3 does not convincingly demonstrate that Cross-TE resolves this.\n6. **Clarity in Equation 1**: Equation 1 lacks clarity in summation notation, as it\u2019s unclear which part of the formula is summed over. Additionally, the notation for \\(i\\) as a time step index raises questions about why an additional superscript is needed to denote the previous time.\n7. **Inconsistencies in Variable Definition**: In the problem definition, \\(x\\) is defined as a time series, \\(X\\) as historical sequences, and \\(Y\\) as future sequences. However, line 263 redefines \\(y\\) as historical, which can be misleading and suggests potential label leakage. The overall presentation of the methodology is unclear and could benefit from consistent use of symbols and fonts.\n8. **Perceived Model Complexity**: Without clear experimental support for its causal relationship advantages, SPACE may appear as a combination of existing techniques (PTE, attention, GCN, and Time Mixers) without sufficient innovation in causality extraction."

Relying on a single sample of the learned adjacency matrix (as shown in Fig. 3) is not enough to explain the dynamic nature of causality. Additional evaluations focusing on dynamic causal dependencies should be provided.\n    - It is also recommended to include examples from real-world datasets that showcase causal relationships.
