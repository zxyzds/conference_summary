    "title": "TAGA: Text-Attributed Graph Self-Supervised Learning by Synergizing Graph and Text Mutual Transformations",
    "abstract": "Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) enhance graph structures with natural language descriptions, enabling detailed representation of data and their relationships across a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. Despite the potential for deeper insights, existing TAG representation learning primarily omit the semantic relationship among node texts, and mostly relies on supervised methods, necessitating extensive labeled data and limiting applicability across diverse contexts. This paper introduces a new self-supervised learning framework, Text-And-Graph Multi-View Alignment (TAGA), which overcomes these constraints by integrating TAGs' structural and semantic dimensions. TAGA constructs two complementary views: Text-of-Graph view, which organizes node texts into structured documents based on graph topology, and the Graph-of-Text view, which converts textual nodes and connections into graph data. By aligning representations from both views, TAGA captures joint textual and structural information. In addition, a novel structure-preserving random walk algorithm is proposed for efficient training on large-sized TAGs. Our framework demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios across eight real-world datasets.",

The paper presents a novel dual-view framework that represents TAGs as both hierarchical documents and graph structures, marking a significant departure from traditional single-view approaches in graph representation learning.\n2. The extensive evaluation demonstrates consistent performance improvements over six state-of-the-art methods across eight diverse datasets, with comprehensive ablation studies and strong transfer learning results validating the method's robustness.\n3. The work addresses the fundamental challenge of jointly modeling text and structure in graph representation learning, offering a practical solution that reduces dependency on labeled data and shows strong performance on real-world applications."

                "value": "While the paper presents a novel and valuable contribution to TAG representation learning, its innovation trends towards increasing complexity rather than seeking elegant solutions. The insufficient analysis of its sophisticated components leaves readers with an understanding of \"what\" but limited insights into \"why\", making it difficult to fully appreciate the fundamental principles behind its effectiveness\uff1a\n1. The paper misses critical discussion and comparison with recent TAG self-supervised methods, particularly \"UniGraph: Learning a Unified Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Text-Attributed Graphs\". This omission raises concerns about the claimed novelty and makes it difficult to assess the true advancement over existing TAG pre-training approaches.\n2.  The dual-view alignment architecture is unnecessarily restricted to self-supervised learning, while this structural design could potentially benefit from other learning paradigms. The paper fails to explore the architecture's potential beyond self-supervised learning.\n3. The preprocessing steps for generating dual views (hierarchical documents and graph structures) incur substantial computational and storage costs, but the paper neither analyzes these overheads nor compares total computation time (preprocessing + training) with baseline methods.\n4. The paper arbitrarily adopts BFS tree with cross-edge references as the document structuring method without any theoretical justification or experimental comparison with alternative organization strategies (like DFS, topological sorting, or community-based structuring), leaving a critical gap in understanding why this specific choice is optimal or even suitable for preserving graph structure in document format.\n5. Despite claiming efficiency through random walk sampling, the paper lacks comprehensive experiments on large-scale graphs, missing analysis of how the random walk strategy affects model performance, and providing no comparison of end-to-end processing time with existing methods."

                "value": "- The evaluation setup is incomplete. Graph self-supervised learning is a well-established research area in the graph field. The standard evaluation setup is linear probing under semi-supervised or supervised settings. While the proposed model performs well in few-shot learning scenarios, it would be beneficial to compare all self-supervised graph models under standard semi-supervised settings, especially for datasets like Cora and PubMed, which were originally designed for semi-supervised learning. Please follow the standard semi-supervised splits in GCN paper, and compare against relevant baselines using this setup.\n- More key related works should be included for comparison or at least discussed. For instance, GIANT [1], UniGraph [2], and UniGLM [3] are leading self-supervised learning methods on TAGs and should be compared. Additionally, works like [4] and [5] should be discussed, as they also integrate textual information and graph topology in a unified manner and support zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Without a thorough discussion of these recent advances, it is challenging to assess the true capabilities of the graph2Text approach. Therefore, a dedicated subsection in the Related Work section is required to discuss these recent advances in self-supervised learning on TAGs, and explain how their approach compares or differs conceptually.\n- Similarly, several graph pre-training methods should be considered for comparison or at least discussed, as they represent distinct directions in graph pre-training. Examples include MaskGAE[6] and S2GAE[7], which serve as edge-level graph-masked autoencoders.\n- The experimental setup for baseline methods needs further clarification. Since many graph pre-training methods (e.g., GraphMAE, GraphCL, and GRACE) were not originally designed for TAGs, data preprocessing is required to encode textual attributes into node features. However, as shown in [5], the choice of PLM encoder can significantly impact the performance of these methods. For a fair comparison, you can add a paragraph in the experimental setup section detailing how to preprocess the textual attributes for the baseline methods. Additionally, conducting more experiments using different PLM backbones for the baselines and report the results.\n- Given TAGA\u2019s capability to train on large graphs, it would be interesting to examine its performance on TAG datasets of varying scales. For instance, would training TAGA on multiple TAGs rather than a single TAG graph further enhance its performance?\n\n[1] Node feature extraction by selfsupervised multi-scale neighborhood prediction.\n\n[2] UniGraph: Learning a Unified Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Text-Attributed Graphs.\n\n[3] UniGLM: Training One Unified Language Model for Text-Attributed Graphs.\n\n[4] Zerog: Investigating cross-dataset zero-shot transferability in graphs\n\n[5] GAugLLM: Improving Graph Contrastive Learning for Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models\n\n[6] Maskgae: Masked graph modeling meets graph autoencoders.\n\n[7] S2GAE: Self-Supervised Graph Autoencoders Are Generalizable Learners with Graph Masking."
