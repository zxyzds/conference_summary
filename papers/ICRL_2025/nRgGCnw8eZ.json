    "title": "KrwEmd: Revising the Imperfect Recall Abstraction from Forgetting Everything",
    "abstract": "Excessive abstraction is a serious issue in solving games with ordered signals\u2014a subset of imperfect information games, caused by extreme implementations of imperfect recall, which discard all historical information and, as a result, negatively impact AI performance. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this issue. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal infosets by leveraging future and, more importantly, historical game information, but also quantitatively reflects their similarity. We then build on this by developing the KrwEmd algorithm, which  cluster signal infosets using Earth Mover\u2019s Distance to assess discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly enhances AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.",

However, in certain cases in imperfect information, improper abstractions may lead to a reduction in performance. This paper introduces an approach to address these extreme cases. The paper introduces a new feature (k-recall winrate) for signal infostates that takes into account both future data and histories and provides a measure of similarity between infosets. The work combines this feature with the earth mover's distance as a distance measure between infosets and shows that this helps improve agent performance."

It was a wall of notation and definition of which I was unable to keep track. It is therefore difficult for me to comment on the soundness of the algorithm proposed. However, I continued to try to complete the other parts of the paper with the idea of the algorithm I gathered from what I could understand.\n\nPertinent details about the experiments do not seem to be provided (games per training iteration or what they meaning by a training iteration, the number of seeds over which the train, significance testing.) Absent this information, I cannot say whether the results support the authors' claims they outperform the other algorithms.\n\nI do not know if it is possible to write the paper as such, but it would be easier to understand if the notations were introduced gradually instead of all at once. For example, perhaps discussing notation needed to understand games then move on to introducing signals. Building up the background in parts might go a long way in easing the average reader into understanding what is needed."

It addresses the significant issue of excessive abstraction in games with ordered signals. This creative combination of historical data with future signal-based clustering represents a significant improvement over traditional methods that rely solely on future information.\n\n2. The paper demonstrates high-quality execution, with solid experimental validation.  The comparisons to state-of-the-art methods, such as POI and other imperfect recall algorithms, are thorough, and the results consistently show the advantages of KrwEmd.  The well-structured experiments provide convincing evidence that the algorithm improves performance while maintaining a reasonable computational cost.\n\n3. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of imperfect information games, as it solves a long-standing issue of excessive abstraction, which is critical for improving AI performance in games like poker and other strategic scenarios."

If there are any mistakes, please feel free to correct me.\n\nQ1: Given that the algorithm is tested only on the Numeral211 Hold\u2019em testbed, do you have plans to test it on a broader range of games, or whether this algorithm can be applied to other games? If so, what kinds of games or environments would you target next, and why were they not included in the current experiments?\n\nQ2: Given that the k-recall feature is manually tuned, have you considered an adaptive or automated mechanism for hyperparameter tuning? \n\nQ3: The paper introduces historical information, but there isn\u2019t much discussion on the trade-off between adding more history and the increase in complexity. Could you clarify how you determined the optimal amount of historical recall to use? In other words, how does the choice of k affect the algorithm\u2019s performance across different games?\n\nQ4: In games with deeper decision trees, especially in the late stages, how does the historical information influence decision-making? Is there a risk that using too much historical information could overcomplicate the abstraction process in the later stages of the game?"
