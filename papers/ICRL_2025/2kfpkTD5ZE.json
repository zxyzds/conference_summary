    "title": "Multi-Modal Foundation Models Induce Interpretable Molecular Graph Languages",
    "abstract": "Recently, domain-specific languages (DSLs) for molecular generation have shown advantages in data-efficiency and interpretability. However, constructing such a DSL requires human expertise or significant computational costs. Multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) have shown remarkable in-context abilities for tasks across vision and text domains, but not graphs. We explore an unconventional solution: we render the molecule as an image, describe it using text, and cast the DSL construction into an equivalent problem of constructing a tree decomposition for the molecular graph. The MMFM performs a chain of discrete decisions to replace traditional heuristics used within the execution of the decomposition, enabling the smooth integration of its prior knowledge without overstepping the limits of the soundness of the algorithm. Furthermore, we collect MMFM\u2019s reasoning for each decision into a design story, have non-expert agents evaluate stories for correctness and persuasiveness, and close the feedback loop to improve the DSL. Our method, Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), demonstrates significant advantages in synthesizability, diversity, and data-efficiency on molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, its compelling chemical interpretability offers built-in transparency over the molecular discovery workflow, paving the way for additional feedback and oversight.",

Is being able to simply generate/sample molecules from a given subdomain useful in itself, or would it only be useful if paired with molecular optimization? \n\n(W2): It's not clear to me how the VAE baselines are set up. Are these models pretrained and then fine-tuned on the (small) dataset in question, or trained on the latter directly? Would it make sense to instead use a frozen pretrained VAE and steer it to sample around a given subdomain by inferring the right region of latent space to sample from? Alternatively, for motif-based models such as HierVAE, one could also constrain the set of motifs to those that appear in the given dataset describing the domain. \n\n=== Other comments === \n\nIn the line of VAE-based models there's also MoLeR (from \"Learning to Extend Molecular Scaffolds with Structural Motifs\"), which is a more modern extension of JT-VAE/HierVAE, often shown to perform better than the latter. \n\n \n\n=== Nitpicks === \n\nBelow I list nitpicks (e.g. typos, grammar errors), which did not have a significant impact on my review score, but it would be good to fix those to improve the paper further. \n\n- Top of page 3: \"notations like SMILES or SELFIES are mainly for representation purposes and can lead to issues (\u2026). This may hinder LLMs\u2019 understanding as they lack sufficient pre-training on these notations compared to SMILES\" is confusing \n\n- Lines 189-191: it's not clear how \"u, v share an atom\" should be interpreted given that context suggests u and v are atoms/nodes? \n\n- Line 403: \"We first observe in Tables 1 and that\" - something is missing \n\n- Line 407: the authors refer to \"dimensions\" without explanation of what this means (I assume each dimension is one of the datasets?) \n\n- Line 426: \"surprising considering.\" - something is missing"

The full term for the proposed method, FMG, is also only in Abstract and not in the main text.\n- The main weakness of this paper is that the experiments are not extensive and robust. Why only grammar-based and VAE methods were selected as a baseline out of the vast molecular generative methods? Moreover, only small and medium datasets were used in the experiments. It would be great to provide results using more popular and larger datasets such as ZINC250k or MOSES for a broader comparison with previous methods.\n- Interpretability is a major advantage of the proposed method, but this advantage is not properly explained and emphasized in the experiment section. I strongly recommend devoting a few paragraphs to interpretability of FMG with a case study.\n- The authors did not provide the codebase to reproduce the results."

This is useful because domain-experts typically trust more something they can rationalize.\nThe authors finally show the performance of their method on some molecular generation benchmarks."

                "value": "### Writing\n\n- It is not very clear what the goal of the paper is. Is it molecular generation, or DSL generation? In either case, very little insight is given into how the generated molecules look like, or how the generated DSL looks like. This is important provided that the paper is so strongly focused on applications.\n\n### Potentially false or misleading claims, lack of evidence/citations.\n- In general the whole introduction section misses a lot of citations. Most of the claims made there are not based on evidence, excepting 3 citations on popular LLM papers, and 1 (Makatura, 2023) that works on LLMs for aid in design. \n- Section 2.3, where the role of FMs for molecular generation is discussed. The authors make several claims that are either false or misleading:\n  - \"SMILES or SELFIES are mainly for representation purposes and can lead to issues in the context of generation\". The SELFIES system was specifically designed for molecular generation, one of the advantages being that every SELFIES string represent a valid molecule, tackling any concerns regarding validity [1].\n  - The authors state that the alternative to FMs for molecular generation are \"GNNs or million-parameter language models for text\" which \"require extensive training resources\". No evidence or citation is provided for this, and furthermore the current work presents no analysis of the computational resources used by the presented method.\n  - The state of the art for molecular generation are indeed language models trained on SMILES [2-4]. Regarding the computational efficiency of these methods, there's a lot of active research focusing on improving the sample efficiency of these methods [5], however none of these works has been considered when making the claims above, nor does the work compare against them in any way.\n\n### Results\n- It is not clear in the results section where each result is coming from, as no citation is linked to each of the methods listed.\n- The notation is very unclear in Table 1 and 2. In particular, the notation Isocyanates (11), does it mean that the dataset of Isocyanates contains 11 samples? This is not clearly stated. Are the results aggregated from the dataset containing Isocyanates, Acrylates and chain extenders? why is this dataset designed like that? \n- It's very unclear what each column represents in these tables. The caption should at least specify this.\n- The analysis is not clear. Example \"...methods do better on 3), but struggle across dimensions 2) and 3).\", what is meant by \"2)\" and \"3)\"? is it refering to Novelty and Diversity? this is not clear and never stated\n- \"However, FMG still leaves some to be desired across 3).\" this sentence is not clear.\n- \"FMG appears to do exceptionally well for PTC (halides) but poor for HOPV (thiophenes), which is surprising considering. As we...\" this sentence is incomplete? \"which is surprising considering...?\"\n\n\n### References\n[1] Krenn, M., H\u00e4se, F., Nigam, A., Friederich, P., & Aspuru-Guzik, A. (2019).

Additionally, many critical experimental details are missing, which limits the reproducibility and applicability of the method.\n\n1. Lack of Definitions: In the abstract, terms like MMFMs and DSLs are introduced without explanation. I suspect that these abbreviations are under-defined. In the methods section, it would help if the authors included explanations or examples of these terms.\n\n2. Lack of Structure: This method appears aimed at addressing a molecular domain-specific language learning task. However, the introduction section offers no information about molecular language, which surprisingly only appears in the Related Work section. This organization feels unusual and somewhat illogical.\n\n3. Lack of Model and Experimental Details: Both the methods and experiments sections lack fundamental details. For example, which MMFM does this approach employ? What prompts are specifically used? What is the dataset description and training cost? How are the baselines evaluated? I am particularly curious about the training and inference procedures, as the method seems to rely on MLLMs to decide the tree decomposition construction of clique graphs, yet it\u2019s unclear how this process is applied to generate new molecules.
