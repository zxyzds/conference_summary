    "title": "SinPoint: A Novel Topological Consistent Augmentation for Point Cloud Understanding",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a highly effective method for addressing the issue of data scarcity in machine learning and computer vision tasks. It involves diversifying the original data through a series of transformations to improve the robustness and generalization ability of the model. However, due to the disorder and irregularity of point clouds, existing methods struggle to enrich geometric diversity and maintain topological consistency, leading to imprecise point cloud understanding. In this paper, we propose SinPoint, a novel method designed to preserve the topological structure of the original point cloud through a homeomorphism. Additionally, it utilizes the Sine function to generate smooth displacements. This simulates object deformations, thereby producing a rich diversity of samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SinPoint consistently outperforms existing Mixup and Deformation methods on various benchmark point cloud datasets, improving performance for shape classification and part segmentation tasks. Specifically, when used with PointNet++ and DGCNN, SinPoint achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2 on shape classification with the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset. Furthermore, our method is highly versatile and scalable, and it can adapt to different scenarios and requirements for point cloud tasks.",

                "value": "The paper introduces SinPoint, a novel point cloud data augmentation method that uniquely combines homeomorphism and sine functions. The method addresses two critical challenges: maintaining topological consistency while increasing geometric diversity in point cloud data. SinPoint offers two transformation strategies: Single Sine Function (SinPoint-SSF) and Multiple Sine Function (SinPoint-MSF). The approach demonstrates superior performance on various benchmark datasets, achieving 90.2% accuracy on the ScanObjectNN dataset for shape classification tasks. The method's key innovation lies in its ability to preserve topological structure while simulating natural object deformations, making it versatile and applicable across different point cloud understanding tasks."

In particular, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the selection basis and performance differences between the SSF and MSF strategies.\n5\u3001Can the topological structure information of point clouds be learned through persistent homology? What are the advantages of the method proposed in this paper over persistent homology in maintaining the topological structure of point clouds?\n6\u3001The expression of Figure 4 needs to be improved."

It is based on a homomorphism and maintains topological consistency while increasing the geometric diversity of samples (perturbs the local structure using a Sine function). The approach has 1) a Single Sine Function (SinPoint-SSF) to deform the point cloud with origin as the initial phase and 2) a Multiple Sine Function (SinPoint-MSF) with different anchor points as the initial phase. Richer deformations are achieved from the superimposition of the sine transforms of different parameters. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework by showing consistent improvements over SOTA augmentation methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets in 3D shape classification and part segmentation tasks. The proposed SinPoint improves the generalization and robustness of several classification models and segmentation (PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN) models."

These backbones are almost five-year-old methods and have ample room to show the impact. The proposed work does not show its effects in recent methods (PointNeXt onwards), making it unclear if the proposed augmentation approach is relevant to the current state-of-the-art segmentation methods. \n- Figures 8 and 9 in the supplementary pages (page 19) show that the second augmented table generated (using SinPoint SSF) shows that the table top surface has a concave bend so that items placed on it would roll over. Such samples are not realistic or meaningful.\n- Inconsistency in using recent models to demonstrate the improvement in classification accuracy for different datasets. For example, PointNeXt, PointMetaBase, and SpoTr are selected to show the improvement in results for the ScanObjectNN dataset's OBJ_ONLY variant in Table 3; the same models are ignored to show the upgrades for the ModelNet40 dataset in Table 2. And vice versa, when considering models in Table 2 that were used to show improvements for the ModelNet40 dataset, they are ignored when showing improvements on ScanObjectNN dataset variants.\n- Some of the SOTA models have both classification and segmentation backbones, but there has been a selective approach to showing improvement on one task while ignoring the other. For example, PointMLP was used as the backbone for classification experiments in Table 3 but ignored for segmentation experiments."
