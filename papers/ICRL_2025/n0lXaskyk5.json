    "title": "Generalization Bounds for Canonicalization: A Comparative Study with Group Averaging",
    "abstract": "Canonicalization, a popular method for generating invariant or equivariant function classes from arbitrary function sets, involves initial data projection onto a reduced input space subset, followed by applying any learning method to the projected dataset. Despite recent research on the expressive power and continuity of functions represented by canonicalization, its generalization capabilities remain less explored. This paper addresses this gap by theoretically examining the generalization benefits and sample complexity of canonicalization, comparing them with group averaging, another popular technique for creating invariant or equivariant function classes. Our findings reveal two distinct regimes where canonicalization may outperform or underperform compared to group averaging, with precise quantification of this phase transition in terms of sample size and group action characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first theoretical exploration of such behavior, offering insights into the relative effectiveness of canonicalization and group averaging under varying conditions.",

The theoretical results suggest that the generalization performance of canonicalization and group average depends on the trade-off between variance and bias (approximation error), where group averaging being superior in variance (by a factor of group size) and canonicalization being superior in bias based on a newly defined alignment metric. The authors also provide a set of proof-of-concept simulation to show that group averaging and canonicalization outperforms each other under different true functions."

The theoretical results shows the interesting trade-off between bias and variance in the generalization error of canonicalization and group averaging, where canonicalization, in general, has better bias and worse variance. This alludes to the idea that canonicalization might benefit in the case of large data size.\n\n3. The trade-off also results in a critical data size value, which unveils an indicator to compare group averaging and canonicalization."

                "value": "1. Corollary 7 seems to be useful and interesting at the first glance, but there are some issues with it. First of all, equation (17) and (18) could be stated more carefully even though the idea is intuitive, as the main theorem provides upper bound rather than precise value (which could make the argument false with small probability). Second, the critical value depends on some factors that are practically intractable, mainly the $\\beta$ alignment factor, but also the noise level. Third, in the case of $\\beta = s$ as suggested in Proposition 3, the critical value goes to infinity, which suggests canonicalization will always be inferior.\n\n2. The statement of Proposition 3 might also cause confusion. First, it is better to state the function class here to remind the reference function class when talking about alignment. Second, upon further reading into the Appendix C, it seems the statement should be $\\beta \\geq s$ rather than $\\beta = s$ (The authors discussed this relation above and below the paragraph, but it could be better to have it in the statement unless there are concerns the authors like to clarify), as this $s$ derivation is based on group averaging and Theorem 1. Also, when $s=\\beta$, it actually causes problem in Corollary 7, where the critical value will go to infinity, which suggests canonicalization will always be worse for G-invariant Sobolov function with parameter s.\n\n3. Simulation is lacking. The provided simulation does align with the general intuition that when the true function is close to the canonicalization representation, canonicalization could do better. However, this simulation does not provide any insights on the effect of data size, which is the main theoretical contribution of the work (the error comparison over the number of observations). I hope the author could at least provide a simple set of simulations that shows the error decay of group averaging vs canonicalization which shows the two converge as n increase and then canonicalization takes the lead. I also suggest investigating the empirical critical value (when error of group averaging starts to surpass canonicalization) over different factors to see whether Corollary 7 could have practical implications for future iterations (considering the limited time for the rebuttal).\n\n1. There are some minor typos that might confuse some readers. For example, one super-script G is missing in equation (15)."

However, how does existing bound compares with the bound derived by the authors is not discussed. Can the author share some details on this matter and remark the novelty here?\n\n2. I have a minor question regarding the example 4 and please correct me if I am wrong. The example is given to demonstrate when the closed space assumption is violated, there could be cases where $F_{GA}$ is not a subset of $F_{CAN}$. However, as stated in line 300, \"the function belongs to $F_{CAN}$ but not $F_{GA}$, which suggests $F_{GA}$ is not a subset of $F_{CAN}$.\" I am not quite following the logic here as I believe we need something on the contrary right?"
