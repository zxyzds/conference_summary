    "title": "Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \\emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. Motivated by the limitation of existing works, we consider a new and general category of learning dynamics called \\emph{Markovian agents}. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \\emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.",

                "value": "This paper presents a framework for steering the behaviors of agents towards desired outcomes within a reinforcement learning setting, where the exact learning dynamics of the agents are not known. Specifically, this work introduces the concept of Markovian agents, whose decisions are based only on their current states and immediate rewards, and explores the challenges posed by model uncertainty in practical applications. To address these challenges, the study develops a non-episodic RL approach and proposes the First-Explore-Then-Exploit (FETE) framework. This strategy involves initially exploring to identify the most accurate model from a predefined class and then exploiting this model to effectively steer agent behaviors. The theoretical contribution of the paper establishes that if the model class of learning dynamics is identifiable within finite steps, then a steering strategy with an \u03b5-steering gap can exist. The empirical results in the paper demonstrate that their algorithm can operate under the assumption that each player has only two actions."

By assuming that the learning dynamics of the agents are Markovian and can be learned in finite steps, the paper effectively simplifies the complex problem of steering under uncertainty.\n\n- The paper provides transparency regarding the experimental assumptions detailed in the appendices. Moreover, the experimental setup involves a wide range of learning rate combinations, specifically up to 3^10.\n\n- The paper is well-written and very easy to follow, with justification and explanation whenever needed in most places."

                "value": "While I appreciate the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the steering problem, balancing exploration and exploitation amidst the uncertainty of agents' learning dynamics, but there are some concerns regarding the paper:\n\n- A primary challenge highlighted is the agents' reluctance to disclose their learning dynamics, creating fundamental model uncertainty. The theoretical discussion posits that if the model class $F$ of the agents is identifiable, then an epsilon-steering strategy is viable. It would enhance the paper if the theoretical sections could more explicitly address how understanding the model class $F$ effectively reduces this uncertainty, thus better connecting the theoretical insights with the algorithmic implementations.\n\n- The algorithm proposed in the paper relies heavily on accurately specifying agents' learning dynamics, which presents a significant challenge when considering real-world complexities where agents' behaviors are influenced by others, such as herd behavior or nonconformity. These dynamic inter-agent interactions introduce variability that the algorithm may not capture effectively, given its current design focused on binary or categorical decision-making scenarios. This specificity restricts its utility, particularly in more complex decision environments where outcomes are not merely binary and agent behaviors are interdependent and continuously evolving. Consequently, while the algorithm provides a structured approach to steering agent decisions within a controlled setting, its application to broader, more realistic scenarios involving complex agent dynamics and multiple decision variables may require significant adaptations to accommodate these behavioral complexity."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- While this paper usefully demonstrates the benefit of steering, it does not sufficiently address whether the proposed steering methods are adequately effective when compared to other potential steering strategies. For example, expanding the comparative analysis to include non-Markovian agent models could help justify the emphasis on Markovian agents in the introduction. Non-Markovian models, which account for past states and decisions in their decision-making processes, often represent more realistic and complex environments. Including such models in the analysis would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed strategies.\n\n- Considering exploration is crucial for addressing the uncertainty in agents' learning dynamics, it would be valuable to investigate how an exploration-focused approach like Random Network Distillation (RND) could impact the results (more than random exploration FETE-RE in Section 6.2). This could provide practical insights into managing uncertainty more effectively in complex multi-agent environments."

Similarly, the notation f\u2217\u00a0is introduced abruptly at line 210 without any prior explanation, creating confusion. The new learning objective\u00a0presented\u00a0in line 220 is also hard to understand and lacks sufficient clarification regarding its purpose and relevance.\n2.
