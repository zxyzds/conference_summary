    "abstract": "Adaptive loss balancing algorithms play a crucial role in improving the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by effectively managing the weights assigned to different loss components. Most notably,  Wang et al. (2022) introduced Causal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Causal PINNs), which achieve superior performance by simply reformulating the loss function based on the causal structure that emerges from time dependency. However, despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical analysis for the effectiveness of Causal PINNs has not received adequate attention. This paper addresses this gap by providing a theoretical rationale for Causal PINNs through the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which is commonly used for causal inference. In addition, motivated by this analysis, we propose a Message Passing PINNs (MP-PINNs), a novel adaptive weighting algorithm. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed MP-PINNs significantly outperform existing adaptive weighting methods, exhibiting superior performance in solving complex PDEs. Our findings highlight the potential of MP-PINNs as a powerful tool to enhance both the accuracy \nand efficiency of PINNs.",

Specifically, they find that running BP over a Markov random field yields the weighting used in Causal PINNs. Next, the authors propose a message passing-based alternative form of PINNs that outperforms adaptive weighting methods for PDEs. Empirically, they demonstrate that these perform better than alternative PINN approaches on a variety of time-dependent PDEs."
