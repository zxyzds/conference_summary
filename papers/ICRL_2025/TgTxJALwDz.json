    "title": "Language Model for Large-Text Transmission in Noisy Quantum Communications",
    "abstract": "Quantum communication has the potential to revolutionise information processing, providing unparalleled security and increased capacity compared to its classical counterpart by using the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the presence of errors poses a significant challenge to realising these advantages. While strategies like quantum error correction and quantum error mitigation have been developed to address these errors, they often come with substantial overhead, hindering the practical transmission of large texts. Here, we introduce an application of machine learning frameworks for natural language processing to enhence the performance of noisy quantum communications, particularly superdense coding. Using BERT, a model known for its capabilities in natural language processing, we demonstrate that language-model-assisted quantum communication protocols can substantially improve the efficiency of large-scale information transmission. This brings us closer to the practical realisation of a quantum internet.",

                "value": "My main issue with this paper is that quantum dense coding does not provide actual savings in communication. To communicate two classical bits via one qubit, one first has to establish an entangled pair between the two parties. Establishing this pair requires communicating a qubit. Thus, the total communication is actually two qubits: one to establish the entangled pair and one to communicate the two classical bits.\n\nQuantum dense coding is interesting from a conceptual perspective, as it replaces two bits of data-dependent computation with two qubits, one of which is data-independent (the one that is used to establish the entangled) and only one is data-independent. However, it does not give an advantage in the overall communication and, therefore, is very unlikely to be used for communicating text or images.\n\nA second issue is the error model which assumes that the initial entangled state is noiseless but the input-dependent qubit of the communication is noisy. As both the entangled state creation and the later qubit communication happen via a quantum communication channel, it would be logical to assume either that both steps are error-corrected or both steps are noisy. Assuming that one step is noiseless in the quantum case can make the comparison between quantum and classical protocols unfair. (On a high level, this corresponds to decreasing the effective error rate by a half.)\n\nA simple alternative would be to subject both qubits of the entangled pair to the same error channel \\Epsilon."

A more comprehensive discussion on the encoding and readout of classical data, as well as the resources needed, in the quantum setting is necessary to assess the practicality of the proposed approach.\n- The numerical experiments are limited to specific datasets.\n- While the numerical experiments claim the effectiveness of PQC-BERT in reducing error rates compared to classical communication, the paper lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of the claimed advantage.\n- The significance and soundness of the contributions are overall not sufficient for ICLR."

There have been a lot of work using transformers and/or deep neural networks in communication systems in more sophisticated manners, and the authors essentially used a naive communication strategy without data compression or error-correcting codes, and directly applied neural networks at the decoder to resolve the errors. There are several key issues:\n\n1. Reasonable baselines. As mentioned by the authors, there have been many works using quantum error control codes. Why are they not compared?\n2. Lack of data compression. It is well known that data compression can reduce the number of bits to represent the text. Why it is not adopted here?\n\nI found the authors spent a large amount of space discussing quantum information and transformer structures, however, almost none is really needed in the development of the corresponding design and evaluation. We can easily replace the quantum channel with a classical channel, and replace the transformers with LSTMs, and it would make little difference in the design."
