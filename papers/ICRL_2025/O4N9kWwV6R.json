    "title": "Few for Many: Tchebycheff Set Scalarization for Many-Objective Optimization",
    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $>100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

                "value": "The authors propose a scheme for many-objective problems with large number of objectives (e.g > 100) where the idea is to find a few representative solutions that address them.\nTo make this scheme possible they use their newly proposed Tchebycheff Set scalarization function that is an extension of the original. Now instead of trying to find a point that minimizes the scalarized problem, is trying to find multiple points that minimize it, allowing it to be bad for some of the m objectives, but it should at least minimize some subset of it.\nThe original Tchebycheff function is non differentiable to the max and min operators, which makes it not the best option to work with gradient based optimization. Therefore they extend the smooth Tchebycheff function in the work Lin et.al 2024 to work on set of solutions."

Tchebycheff as the scalarizing function has also been shown to cover the non-convex solutions in the Pareto Front. The regular approach only aims to have a solution per direction, by modifying the function to instead search for a set of points that while being good for the other objectives it should be the best for a subset of all objectives.\n\nThe text introduces well non multi-objective practitioners to the setting, the difficulty present in many-objective problems, and previous work and results on scalarization with the simple weighted sum and the Tchebycheff function.\nAppendices further explore the effect of the smoothness parameter and complement the main text with more experiments."

                "value": "My major concern is about the problem setting. The proposed method aims to find a few solutions that collaboratively optimize many objectives. This problem setting is quite different from the common setting in multi- or many-objective optimization, which aims to find some solutions with diverse trade-offs. I agree with the authors that one of the main obstacles in many-objective optimization is that, with the increase in the number of objectives, the number of solutions has to increase exponentially to cover the whole PF. The idea proposed in this paper is interesting; however, I do not think it really solves this problem. When the number of objectives is very high, it only searches for extreme points, that is, solutions with very low values for some objectives but significant sacrifices in others. By putting together these multiple extreme points, it appears as if multiple objective functions can be *\"simultaneously\"* optimized. Actually, although many MOAs output a set of solutions, after multi-objective decision-making, typically only one solution is finally selected, and, in practice, solutions with a more balanced tradeoff are often preferred. Therefore, while the TCH-Set offers a novel idea for many-objective optimization, I think its practical impact and significance are limited."

What optimization methods are used under the scalarization methods for the convex multi-objective optimization in Section 4.1?\n4. A brief analysis of why STCH-Set performs slightly worse than SoM in two cases in Table 4 would be beneficial.\n5. It should be clarified why the part results of MosT are \u201c-\u201d in Table 6.\n6. All mathematical symbols (e.g., $K$ and $m$) in the tables should use the correct mathematical formatting.\n7. In line 227, a space is missing after the period.\n8. In line 1473, there is an incorrect line break, and \u201cterm0\u201d appears to be a typo.\n9. In line 1487, a space is missing before \u201c(S)TCH\u201d.\n10. An open question is whether the proposed approach is especially suited for many-objective optimization with non-conflicting objectives. How would it perform when all objectives are conflicting?"
