    "abstract": "The most promising approach to achieving nuclear fusion is through tokamaks, which confine plasma using magnetic fields.\nUnderstanding the current plasma equilibrium state in tokamaks is critical for effective plasma control.\nUnlike previous studies, which reconstruct equilibrium from magnetic field information, our work forecasts future equilibrium based on past equilibrium states.\nSpecifically, we formulate the plasma equilibrium prediction task as a video prediction task, a well-explored problem in the machine learning community.\nThis formulation allows us to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of plasma states and provides a foundation for multimodal modeling of data streams from tokamak operations.\nOur methodology, incorporating a physics-inspired learning technique for physically reliable predictions, achieved plausible results in forecasting future plasma equilibrium up to 200 ms ahead compared to baselines.\nThis approach holds promise for predicting plasma instabilities and preventing disruptions, marking a significant step towards developing stable fusion reactors.",

Only convLSTM is really compared with for forecasting.  But I would argue there should have been a much richer set of comparatives.  For instance, there is the very simply DMD method for forecasting plasma dynamics:\n\nhttps://pubs.aip.org/aip/pop/article/27/3/032108/929066\n\nThe dynamics they are looking have been shown to be pretty well characterized by a linear model in many application areas.  Using all this technology without comparison to a baseline linear model does not warrant the paper to move forward.  I work in spatio-temporal dynamic systems and just don't find their results compelling enough in terms of advancing the field, nor the results so compelling in terms of the application itself.\n\nAnd there are other methods that should have been applied beside convLSTM:  \n\nResNet (He et al 2016)\nPredRNN (Wang et al 2017)\n\nAlso, completely missed for the video prediction task idea is https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00281-6\n\nUltimately, I just don't think either the results or their method represent an innovative enough leap (either in the ML/AI architecture proposed or in the advancement of the application) for ICLR.\n\nI cannot recommend the paper moving forward at this point."
