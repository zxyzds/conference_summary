    "title": "The Crystal Ball Hypothesis in diffusion models: Anticipating object positions from initial noise",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation tasks, yet the influence of initial noise remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identify specific regions within the initial noise image, termed trigger patches, that play a key role in inducing object generation in the resulting images. Notably, these patches are **universal** and can be generalized across various positions, seeds, and prompts. To be specific, extracting these patches from one noise and injecting them into another noise leads to object generation in targeted areas. To identify the trigger patches even before the image has been generated, just like consulting the crystal ball to foresee fate, we first create a dataset consisting of Gaussian noises labeled with bounding boxes corresponding to the objects appearing in the generated images and **train a detector that identifies these patches from the initial noise.** To explain the formation of these patches, we reveal that they are **outliers** in Gaussian noise, and follow distinct distributions through two-sample tests. These outliers can take effect when injected into different noises and generalize well across different settings. Finally, we find the misalignment between prompts and the trigger patch patterns can result in unsuccessful image generations. To overcome it, we propose a reject-sampling strategy to obtain optimal noise, aiming to improve prompt adherence and positional diversity in image generation.",

In line 231, \"As shown in the Figure\", missing reference to the Figure. In line 293, missing (2) before \"Can noises with multiple ...\". In line 417, \":\" is missing after \"Control\", and the first word after \":\"\uff0c should be lowercase.  In line 1070, \"Please refer to the Fig F.2 for visualized results.\", I can not find the Fig.F2.\n\n2. In Figure 13, the prompt is not consistent with the provided images.\n\n3. All intuitive images in the main paper only contain five concepts. Can the authors provide more visualization results?\n\nMethods and Experiments:\n\n1. For the evaluation metrics, the authors only utilize the CLIP. I think it is crucial to utilize some human preference models like PickScore, HPSv2 to evaluate the quality of the generated images.\n\n2. The dataset constructed by the authors only contains five single concepts, consisting of 500K samples. How do the authors ensure that whether the trigger patches exist beyond these five prompts, and the detector trained in this manner can recognize other concepts? Besides, I think the construction of the dataset is resource-consuming.\n\n3. The authors claim that low entropy ISR will be higher; however, Table 6 shows that certain mid-entropy ISRs are also quite high. How should the authors explain this phenomenon?\n\n4. All of the main results are conducted only in Stable Diffusion v2. Can the authors provide the existence of the trigger patches in other diffusion models?\n\n5. Experiment results in Table 5 reveal \u201cRandom\u201d can surpass \"Initno\" and \"Attend-and-Excite\". This phenomenon is very strange because as far as I know, both of them optimize the noise during the reverse process. They should be higher than \"Random\"?\n\n6. The experiment results in Generalization part raise my concerns. From the results presented in Table 8, it seems that trigger patch injection is only effective with deterministic samplers, showing no impact on stochastic samplers. The authors also default to using a deterministic sampler. Besides, based on the results in Table 10, why is the gap reduction so pronounced across other models? If the initial noise inherently carries positional bias, then its performance across different diffusion models should be similar. However, the experimental results seem to contradict the notion that the trigger patch is universal."
