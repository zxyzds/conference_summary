    "title": "LCSim: A Large-Scale Controllable Traffic Simulator",
    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of urban transportation and the continuous progress in autonomous driving, a demand for robust benchmarking autonomous driving algorithms has emerged, calling for accurate modeling of large-scale urban traffic scenarios with diverse vehicle driving styles. Traditional traffic simulators, such as SUMO, often depend on hand-crafted scenarios and rule-based models, where vehicle actions are limited to speed adjustment and lane changes, making it difficult for them to create realistic traffic environments. In recent years, real-world traffic scenario datasets have been developed alongside advancements in autonomous driving, facilitating the rise of data-driven simulators and learning-based simulation methods. However, current data-driven simulators are often restricted to replicating the traffic scenarios and driving styles within the datasets they rely on, limiting their ability to model multi-style driving behaviors observed in the real world. We propose \\textit{LCSim}, a large-scale controllable traffic simulator. First, we define a unified data format for traffic scenarios and provide tools to construct them from multiple data sources, enabling large-scale traffic simulation. Furthermore, we integrate a diffusion-based vehicle motion planner into LCSim to facilitate realistic and diverse vehicle modeling. Under specific guidance, this allows for the creation of traffic scenarios that reflect various driving styles. Leveraging these features, LCSim can provide large-scale, realistic, and controllable virtual traffic environments. Codes and demos are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LCSim-0C7A.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main concern lies in some overclaims and potential misrepresentations. \n\n1. Firstly, the authors repeatedly refer to LCSim as a \"simulation system\" in both the title and contributions. However, a true traffic simulator should support \"*closed-loop*\" operations where vehicles run according to generated trajectories and continuously replan as the scenario changes. Despite the authors' claims, neither the manuscript nor the anonymous website demonstrates actual simulation effects, only showing one-time multi-vehicle joint  motion planning. If LCSim is indeed a simulator, the authors should particularly showcase experiments and results of continuous simulation over an extended period in a closed-loop setting.\n\n2. Secondly, the authors emphasize that LCSim is \"large-scale\" and present experiments in Section 4.4. However, the Method section lacks explanation on how LCSim supports city-scale simulation, such as handling trajectory generation for hundreds or thousands of vehicles simultaneously, or supporting city-level road network operations and construction. The proposed diffusion-based motion planner seems unable to generate trajectories for so many vehicles in a city simultaneously, raising several unaddressed technical questions. \nSection 4.4 only presents some city road network renderings and figures of road speed and arrival times, further adding to the confusion about how the authors implemented details such as \"travel schedule of each agent in LCSim with a series of trips between intersections with corresponding departure time and arrival time\" (line 466).\n\n3. Lastly, even if considered as a multi-vehicle planner/predictor work, this paper *does not achieve state-of-the-art performance*. The two methods compared in Table 2 are from 2021 and outdated. When considering recent works from the Waymo SimAgent challenge (https://waymo.com/open/challenges/), such as BehaviorGPT (Collision 0.74, Off-Road 0.90) and MPS (Collision 0.96, Off-Road 0.93), we see that they significantly outperform LCSim (Collision 4.118, Off-Road 1.518)."

However, instead of unifying all simulators it risks developing yet another simulator (https://xkcd.com/927/). The diffusion-based motion policy also lacks significant novelty and is similar to CTG.\n* Single-threaded, slow simulator: Compared to Waymax (thank you for providing this comparison!), LCSim is slow and not accelerator-compatible.\n* Simulator comparison: The simulator comparison in Table 1 does not seem totally fair. For example, Waymax does support data-driven and controllable agents, even though it does not provide one out of the box. Hence, the last sentence in Related Work that LCSim presents the first open-source traffic simulator with a controllable learning-based vehicle model is also too strong.\n* Lack of related work: The unified data format that is provided is not compared to other formats, e.g. ASAM OpenDrive, that try to provide data format standards. \n* Lack of strong baselines for diffusion planner: The baselines are both from 2021."

LCSim takes as input a scenario and first inputs the map information and the historical information of all the agents into a scene encoder. The diffusion decoder then is responsible for providing future T_f steps of the agents in the scenario. The diffusion model uses a guided loss function with the following loss components: max acceleration, target velocity, time headway, relative distance, goal point, no collision, no off-road. The authors show comparisons between a private driving dataset and WOMD dataset and also the private dataset and the simulation dataset. The histograms show that the simulation can more closely follow the private dataset. The authors also trained a few RL agents on the simulation and provided metrics of the trained agents. The authors also provided city-scale scenario simulations."

                "value": "**Impact**\n\nTraffic simulation is important for the self-driving industry. Though real-world data helps improve the realism of background agents, none of the existing simulated agents can be controlled to show specific behaviors, driving styles, or even out-of-distribution ones that don't exist in the training data, i.e. collision. The use of diffusion in recent years shows the promise to solve this problem. Though using diffusion to generate traffic agents is not new, this work is the first one to try building a simulator with diffusion-based background agents and yields some new conclusions. \n\n**Soundness**\n\nThe experiments are comprehensive and show some interesting conclusions:\n1. The generated agents' trajectories match the distribution of the Waymo Dataset (test) very well\n2. By adding guidance, the generated agents' collision/off-road rate can be further improved\n3. DiffusionAgents trained with Waymo data can match the distribution of another dataset collected in Beijing by only adjusting the guidance function (without retraining), which is amazing.\n4. Adjusting the guidance of background agents can produce different styles of traffic. Training single-RL agent in different styles of traffic produces different RL agent behavior. For example, RL agent will be conservative when the surrounding diffusion agents are with a guidance to drive close to them.\n5. City-level traffic simulation shows the model can capture the traffic feature for different cities in terms of arrival time error, which further confirms its ability to model the data distribution.\n\nGiven the results, I believe the claim of a \"controllable and realistic simulator\" is well-supported. \n\n**Quality**\n\nAs an open-sourced machine learning system work, the code/documentation quality of this work is good and easy to follow."

It is tricky to generate reasonable adversarial behaviors rather than stupid rear collisions which is unavoidable for the ego car.\n2. The conclusion of Table 3 seems to have Incorrect references, i.e. the third one is \"with adv\" not \"with gentle\". \n3. What is the decision interval or simulation frequency? Would the closed-loop simulation performance change accordingly if the decision interval is changed? It seems to be an important hyperparameter for closed-loop simulation in the Waymo Sim Agent paper.\n4. Is it possible to test open-sourced driving software in this simulator, like autoware? If it can be used to find misbehavior in open-sourced AD systems by adjusting background agents' behaviors, its impact can be enhanced."

The diffusion policy can be used to control not only the background agents but the ego car as well like what the RL agent did. Did the authors observe some interesting differences between the RL policy and diffusion policy when using it to control the ego car? Maybe the RL agents incur less infractions, since it is trained in closed-loop but the diffusion agent is basically doing behavior cloning?"
