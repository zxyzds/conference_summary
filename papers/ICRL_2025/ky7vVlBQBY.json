    "abstract": "In recent years, the Shapley value and SHAP explanations have emerged as one\nof the most dominant paradigms for providing post-hoc explanations of blackbox models. Despite their well-founded theoretical properties, many recent works\nhave focused on the limitations in both their computational efficiency and their\nrepresentation power. The underlying connection with additive models, however,\nis left critically under-emphasized in the current literature. In this work, we find\nthat a variational perspective linking GAM models and SHAP explanations is able\nto provide deep insights into nearly all recent developments. In light of this connection, we borrow in the other direction to develop a new method to train interpretable GAM models which are automatically purified to compute the Shapley\nvalue in a single forward pass. Finally, we provide theoretical results showing the\nlimited representation power of GAM models is the same Achilles\u2019 heel existing\nin SHAP and discuss the implications for SHAP\u2019s modern usage in CV and NLP.",

                "value": "The paper introduces InstaSHAP, a method that leverages the link between Shapley values and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to create a more efficient model for interpreting ML models. The authors argue that while SHAP explanations are widely used for model interpretability, they have inherent computational challenges and limitations in representing feature interactions. The authors propose a variational approach that unifies Shapley values with additive models via functional ANOVA. InstaSHAP provides an approach to explain models in a single forward pass, and incorporates a new loss function with output masking to automatically purify GAM models. Experiments demonstrate that InstaSHAP outperforms baselines in approximating Shapley values on synthetic, tabular, and high-dimensional data."

This work is original in its use of functional ANOVA to connect Shapley values and GAMs, and in addressing limitations in handling correlated features\u2014an area where Shapley methods traditionally struggle.\n\nThe paper is technically sound, presenting a useful theoretical framework with a loss function for automatic GAM purification. The experiments are well-designed, testing InstaSHAP across synthetic, tabular, and high-dimensional datasets, with results (at least on synthetic data) that convincingly support the method\u2019s advantages over existing approaches like FastSHAP in representing complex feature interactions."

Additionally, while the authors compare InstaSHAP to FastSHAP, further comparisons with other recent Shapley-based methods, such as KernelSHAP or TreeSHAP, could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method\u2019s relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\n2. While the InstaSHAP method addresses the efficiency limitations of SHAP, it would be helpful to clarify any potential trade-offs in accuracy or interpretability when using the purified GAM approach. Addressing when and why InstaSHAP might yield different Shapley values from those generated by traditional methods could enhance readers' understanding of the practical implications and limitations of this approach.\n\n3. The paper could benefit from a discussion on how InstaSHAP\u2019s approach relates to causal explanation methods. For instance, the authors could consider highlighting situations where InstaSHAP may not capture causal relationships due to feature correlations that stem from confounding variables rather than true causal links."

This is an impressive alignment of two core ideas in model interpretability\u2014using Shapley values for feature importance and GAMs for creating interpretable models. By introducing a variational framework that connects GAMs with Shapley explanations, the authors present a conceptually rich and practical model for instant interpretability. This work also does a great job addressing and combining limitations of methods like FastSHAP and FaithSHAP, enabling it to tackle feature interactions even in high-dimensional datasets.\n\nQuality: The paper\u2019s quality is high, with robust theoretical analysis backed by thorough empirical validation. The authors prove several key points, including the link between Shapley values and functional ANOVA decompositions, and specify conditions where Shapley explanations hold up. They support these theoretical findings with extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing how InstaSHAP outperforms traditional methods both in speed and accuracy. Overall, the paper is well-researched, thoughtfully designed, and clearly accounts for the limitations and assumptions behind their approach, giving a well-rounded view of InstaSHAP\u2019s potential.\n\nClarity: The paper is generally well-written, guiding the reader from theoretical underpinnings to the practical use of InstaSHAP. Key ideas, like the interplay between Shapley values and GAMs, are explained in detail, making it easier to understand how the method works even for readers less familiar with the nuances of either technique. Visual aids and detailed breakdowns of the mathematics further aid clarity. However, some heavily mathematical sections could benefit from a more intuitive explanation to make it even more accessible, especially for readers focused on practical applications.\n\nSignificance: This work could make a meaningful impact on the field of interpretable machine learning. InstaSHAP\u2019s efficiency makes Shapley-based explanations much more practical for real-time use in areas like healthcare, finance, and other high-stakes domains. Its ability to handle feature interactions through the GAM framework could inspire further development in interpretable models that are both fast and powerful. The theoretical contributions here also lay a solid foundation for future work on GAMs and functional ANOVA in model interpretation, which researchers and practitioners could build on."

                "value": "Limited Scope of Experiments\n\nThe experiments on synthetic and tabular datasets give a good picture of InstaSHAP\u2019s strengths, but the evaluations on high-dimensional data, like images or text, feel a bit limited. Given that InstaSHAP is designed for complex tasks in fields like computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), it would be helpful to see its performance on a broader range of real-world datasets in these areas. Right now, the CUB bird dataset is the only high-dimensional example, so including more CV and NLP datasets could provide a stronger case for InstaSHAP\u2019s versatility in real-world applications.\n\nSuggestion: Adding evaluations on popular high-dimensional datasets in CV (like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) and NLP (such as SST-2 or IMDB) would better showcase InstaSHAP\u2019s performance on tasks that feature complex interactions and correlations.\n\nComplexity of Theoretical Explanations\n\nThe paper does an impressive job with the theory, but some sections\u2014especially those that dive into the variational equations and functional ANOVA\u2014might feel overwhelming for readers who aren\u2019t well-versed in the math. It would be helpful to have more intuitive explanations in these areas, so readers can grasp the main ideas without needing to go too deep into the technical details.\n\nSuggestion: Including a high-level summary or simpler examples to illustrate the variational formulation and ANOVA concepts could make these sections more accessible. Even a short summary or diagram could help clarify the main points for readers who are looking for an overall understanding rather than technical details.\n\nAssumptions About Feature Correlations\n\nInstaSHAP\u2019s approach assumes certain patterns in how features are correlated, especially in how it handles feature interactions. While this is touched upon, the paper could go further in explaining how InstaSHAP might perform if the correlations between features differ from these assumptions. This would be valuable for practitioners who want to apply InstaSHAP to datasets with different correlation structures.\n\nSuggestion: Providing a discussion or some analysis of InstaSHAP\u2019s performance on datasets with varied correlation patterns could be helpful. Even some general guidelines on when InstaSHAP might face limitations with unusual or weaker correlations would offer more context for its practical use.\n\nLimited Comparison with Other Explainability Methods\n\nThe paper primarily compares InstaSHAP with other SHAP-based methods like FastSHAP and FaithSHAP, but it would be helpful to see how it stacks up against non-SHAP explainability methods like LIME, Integrated Gradients, or counterfactual explanations. This would give a more complete view of InstaSHAP\u2019s strengths and where it might still have limitations.\n\nSuggestion: Adding comparisons with a few well-known, non-SHAP explainability techniques could give a more rounded picture of where InstaSHAP fits into the broader field. Showing InstaSHAP\u2019s performance alongside these other methods on selected benchmarks could highlight its unique advantages or challenges.\n\nScalability to Higher-Order Interactions\n\nThe paper points out that InstaSHAP has trouble scaling with higher-order interactions in high-dimensional data, which impacts its performance on tasks with complex dependencies, as seen in the bird classification experiment. Since handling these kinds of interactions is important for CV tasks with spatial relationships or NLP tasks with sequential data, it would be great if InstaSHAP could be adapted to handle these better.\n\nSuggestion: Exploring modifications to InstaSHAP\u2019s architecture, like using hierarchical or multi-scale structures, could potentially improve its handling of complex dependencies. Even some suggestions for future work in this area would be helpful."

Additional High-Dimensional Datasets in Evaluation\n\n    Question: Could you provide more insights into why the high-dimensional evaluations were limited to the CUB bird dataset? Was it a matter of computational resources, dataset availability, or other considerations?\n    Suggestion: Including results on a broader set of high-dimensional datasets, such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet for computer vision, or popular NLP datasets (e.g., SST-2 or IMDB), would help demonstrate InstaSHAP\u2019s scalability and effectiveness across a wider range of real-world scenarios. If adding these evaluations is not feasible, a discussion on InstaSHAP\u2019s potential limitations or expected behavior on these kinds of datasets would be beneficial.\n\n2. Intuitive Explanation of the Theoretical Framework\n\n    Question: Some sections, particularly those with dense variational equations and functional ANOVA decompositions  may be challenging for readers without a strong theoretical background. Could you clarify or add a more intuitive explanation of the variational framework and functional ANOVA, perhaps with a real-world example or simplified illustration?\n    Suggestion: A high-level summary or visual aid, either in the main text or supplementary material, could make the theoretical foundations more accessible. This could help readers, especially practitioners, grasp the core concepts without needing to follow every technical detail.\n\n3. Handling of Feature Correlations\n\n    Question: InstaSHAP relies on certain assumptions about feature correlations, particularly with respect to how it handles conditional expectations in feature interactions. Could you elaborate on how InstaSHAP might perform in cases where correlations differ significantly from these assumptions? Are there any specific conditions under which InstaSHAP\u2019s accuracy or interpretability might be compromised?\n    Suggestion: A more detailed discussion on how InstaSHAP manages datasets with varying levels of feature correlation would be valuable. It would also help to provide guidelines on how practitioners can assess whether their datasets align with InstaSHAP\u2019s assumptions, or whether InstaSHAP might be less effective under certain correlation structures.\n\n4. Comparison with Non-SHAP Explainability Methods\n\n    Question: The paper mainly compares InstaSHAP with other SHAP-based methods. Could you provide more context on how InstaSHAP would perform in comparison to other interpretability methods, such as LIME, Integrated Gradients, or counterfactual explanations? For example, what are its expected advantages or limitations relative to these non-SHAP approaches?\n    Suggestion: Adding experiments or a comparative analysis with non-SHAP methods could offer a fuller understanding of InstaSHAP\u2019s relative performance and strengths. This would also give readers insight into when InstaSHAP might be preferable to these other methods and when it might be more limited.\n\n5. Scalability to Higher-Order Interactions and Complex Dependencies\n\n    Question: The paper mentions challenges in scaling InstaSHAP for datasets with higher-order interactions or complex dependencies, which is especially relevant in tasks with spatial or sequential data. Do you see potential ways InstaSHAP could be adapted to handle these scenarios more effectively?\n    Suggestion: Exploring architectural modifications or possible future improvements for handling higher-order interactions, such as multi-scale or hierarchical structures, would be helpful. Even speculative ideas on how InstaSHAP could evolve in this direction could be useful for readers interested in expanding its applicability.\n\n6. Practical Guidelines for Real-World Application\n\n    Question: Are there specific types of datasets or problem settings where InstaSHAP might be particularly well-suited or less effective? Do you have recommendations for practitioners on the best practices for applying InstaSHAP in real-world tasks?\n    Suggestion: Including a section with practical guidelines, detailing ideal use cases or specific considerations for InstaSHAP\u2019s application in real-world scenarios, would provide valuable context for practitioners. This might include advice on dataset types, feature characteristics, or model architectures that align well with InstaSHAP\u2019s strengths."
