    "title": "Spectral Highways: Injecting Homophily into Heterophilic Graphs",
    "abstract": "It is widely assumed that standard GNNs perform better on graphs with high homophily, leading to the development of specialised algorithms for heterophilic datasets in recent years. In this work, we both challenge and leverage this assumption. Rather than creating new algorithms, we emphasise the importance of understanding and enriching the data. We introduce a novel data engineering technique, \\textit{Spectral Highways}, that enhances the performance of both heterophilic and non-heterophilic GNNs on heterophilic datasets. Our method augments a given heterophilic graph by adding supernodes, thereby creating a network of highways connecting spectral clusters in the graph. It facilitates additional paths to bring similar nodes closer than dissimilar ones by reducing the average shortest path lengths. We draw both intuitive and empirical connections between the relative decreases in intraclass and interclass average shortest path lengths and shifts in the graph's homophily levels, providing a novel perspective that extends beyond traditional homophily measures. We conduct extensive experiments on seven heterophilic datasets using various GNN architectures and also compare with data-centric techniques, demonstrating significant improvements in node classification performance. Furthermore, our empirical findings highlight the strong sensitivity of several recent GNNs to the random seed used for data splitting, underscoring the importance of this often-overlooked factor in GNN evaluation.",

                "value": "This paper presents a graph data augmentation method called Spectral Highway (SH). It involves dividing existing nodes into clusters using spectral clustering and then adding a layer of nodes on top of them. Each new node corresponds to a spectral cluster in the original graph. The new nodes form a fully connected subgraph, and they are connected to the original nodes belonging to their respective clusters in a principled way.\n\n**Experiments.**\nThe authors tested the improvement in node classification performance on several classic *small-scale* datasets, showing *significant* results on ChameleonF and SquirrelF. They also compared SH with several rewiring and data-centric methods, demonstrating the advantages of SH as a graph augmentation method.\n\n**Analysis.**\nThe authors mainly considered the impact of SH on homophily *intuitively and through experiments*, as well as the effect on intra-class and inter-class average shortest path lengths."

However, the algorithm depends on spectral clustering, which seems to prevent it from scaling to larger datasets.\n\n2.

To better showcase the novelty, I suggest that the authors emphasize these unique aspects more explicitly and explore how these modifications lead to improvements over [1] and similar methods.\n2. While enriching the graph can enhance performance, it may also introduce considerable computational overhead, especially on large-scale datasets. I recommend that the authors include a detailed analysis of time and space complexity. Specifically, it would be beneficial to compare the construction time of Spectral Highways relative to the original graph size, as well as its impact on downstream GNN runtime.\n3. Since datasets are already introduced in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 could be streamlined to focus primarily on algorithmic contributions without redundancies. In table 2, The analysis could be expanded to include comparisons that consider performance gains across dataset characteristics, such as homophily levels, graph sizes, and class distributions. This additional detail would make the results more informative and enable better comparisons across datasets.\n\n[1] Azabou, Mehdi, et al. \"Half-Hop: A graph upsampling approach for slowing down message passing.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

                "value": "- Most of the datasets used in the experiments are small and have certain flows. Namely, Cornell, Texas and Wisconsin are extremely small and are unbalanced (so, accuracy should not be used as a performance metric). Then, Squirrel Filtered and Chameleon Filtered are used by Platonov et al. (2023) to illustrate the flows of the original Squirrel and Chameleon and are not advised for further usage. The new datasets proposed by Platonov et al. (2023) are not used in this paper. Similarly, only one dataset from Lim et al. (2021) is used. The authors write that \"We could not take other datasets like pokec, genius, wiki, etc., as their experiments ran out of memory, and twitch-gamers due to resource constraint.\" Does this apply to all models? For instance, Platonov et al. (2023) use several simple models that show good results on their datasets. The absence of experiments on realistic datasets reduces the reliability of conclusions made in the paper.\n- From the description of the proposed approach it is not clear why one would expect it to work on heterophilic datasets. In particular, it is not obvious why it should improve homophily. As I understand, new edges are added independently of whether they are homophilic. Thus, it seems that edges with neutral homophily are added which agrees with the results reported in Table 3: adding neutral edges to heterophilic graphs makes them more homophilous (adjusted homophily, in most cases, becomes closer to zero), and adding neutral edges to homophilic graphs makes them more heterophilous (again, adjusted homophily becomes closer to zero).\n- In lines 208-232 the authors discuss several options for their algorithm and write that it is not always the case that the intuitive option works and thus all the options need to be tried on a particular dataset. Thus, the proposed approach is not so well supported by the intuition described in the text.\n- Equation (1) is claimed to be a formal mathematical description of the proposed algorithm, but it is not a valid mathematical expression and thus complicates the reading.\n- If I am not mistaken, code for reproducing the results is not provided.\n- Some of the ideas of the proposed approach are related to the concept of virtual nodes, so I suggest discussing related work on this topic (e.g., Hwang et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2024). For instance, similarly to the proposed approach, Hwang et al. (2022) cluster the initial graph and assign a virtual node to each cluster (however, there are no edges between the virtual nodes).\n\nHwang, EunJeong, et al. \"An analysis of virtual nodes in graph neural networks for link prediction.\" The First Learning on Graphs Conference. 2022.\n\nQian, Chendi, et al. \"Probabilistic Graph Rewiring via Virtual Nodes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.17311, 2024.\n\nMinor comments:\n- The range of indices in equation (8) can be fixed: $p$ and $q$ range from 1 to $C$, $p \\neq q$ should be inside the formula, the comment about $i$ and $j$ also should not be outside the formula (since these are indices inside the sum).\n- Table 1: For better readability, I suggest highlighting the best result not only in cases when the proposed solution outperforms the baseline.\n- Table 7: I suggest highlighting the best algorithms in this table too.\n\u00a0\nTypos:\n- L43: \"updation\" -> \"updates\"\n- L52: \"labels. e.g. In\"\n- L428: Should be \\citet here\n- L484: \"denotes\" -> \"denote\""

This makes the last paragraph of contribution very abrupt and lacks motivation. I would recommend adding a paragraph pointing out the current challenges.\n2. Again, the related works provide little context or motivation with respect to the proposed method. As this is not a survey paper, these paragraphs are not helpful. This section should serve as a motivation for proposing your work.\n3. In line 158, in heterophilic networks, vertices with high similarity are usually 2 steps away. \u201cFar away\u201d is an ambiguous description.\n4. Figure 1 does not look like a heterophilic graph, as most edges are connected by the nodes with the same label.\n5. The connectivity between the spectral nodes seems redundant. It would be helpful to have an ablation study of removing all the edges between the spectral nodes. Moreover, there is no ablation study at all.\n6. In Table 2, most baselines have different base GNN models and make the results not comparable. Dir-SAGE and SH (Dir-SAGE) seem to be comparable, but the results are statistically tied.\n7. Section 6 should be moved forward to be right after the proposed method section, to justify the design of the proposed method. However, most analyses are indirect to the reason for performance improvement, and do not help understand why the method works. A theoretical analysis would largely improve the completeness of the paper.\n8. In Table 7, using SH hurts the performance in the homophilic graphs most times. In real-world, given a graph with limited labels, knowing whether it is homophilic or heterophilic is not an easy problem. This is important but also not discussed in the paper."
