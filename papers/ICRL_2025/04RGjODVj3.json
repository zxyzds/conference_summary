    "title": "From Rest to Action: Adaptive Weight Generation for Motor Imagery Classification from Resting-State EEG Using Hypernetworks",
    "abstract": "Existing EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems require long calibration sessions from the intended users to train the models, limiting their use in real-world applications. Additionally, despite containing user-specific information and features correlating with BCI performance of a user, resting-state EEG data is underutilized, especially in motor imagery decoding tasks. To address the challenge of within and across-user generalisation, we propose a novel architecture, HyperEEGNet, which integrates HyperNetworks (HNs) with the EEGNet architecture to adaptively generate weights for motor imagery classification based on resting-state data. Our approach performs similarly in a Leave-Subject-Out scenario using a dataset with 9 participants, compared to the baseline EEGNet. When the dataset size is scaled, with 33 participants' datasets, the model demonstrates its generalisation capabilities using the information from resting state EEG data, particularly when faced with unseen subjects. Our model can learn robust representations in both cross-session and cross-user scenarios, opening a novel premise to leverage the resting state data for downstream tasks like motor imagery classification. The findings also demonstrate that such models with smaller footprints reduce memory and storage requirements for edge computing. The approach opens up avenues for faster user calibration and better feasibility of edge computing, a favourable combination to push forward the efforts to bring BCIs to real-world applications.",

The HyperNet + EEGNet approach does not seem to work for the BCI IV IIa dataset (one of the two datasets tested). The authors mention that it is evidence that the method does not seem to work unless with a larger dataset. It would be better if there were another dataset that can be tested to show that the HyperNet + EEGNet approach does indeed improve classification given more than 9 subjects. Alternatively, the Dreyer et al. dataset could be evaluated while varying the number of subjects for training, e.g. 8, 16, 24, 32, etc to see if the trend of improving performance given more subjects occurs."

                "value": "1. The term \"epoch\" seems to be overloaded since they are common terms used in EEG and in machine learning but mean different things. I think it becomes unclear which meaning you use in the paper sometimes, for example here is the term \"epoch\" used in close proximity, although the former seems to mean a window of data and the latter seems to mean the number of times the HyperNet is trained on all batches: \n>\u2022 Motor imagery activity data in the form of an epoch is used to perform the binary class\nclassification with a forward pass on EEGNet with the generated weights from HyperNet.\n\u2022 Cross entropy loss is accumulated for a batch of 50 epochs, and backpropagation is performed only on HyperNet parameters. Adam optimiser with learning rate 1e-4 is used.\" \n\nIt would be better if the term \"epoch\" is better clarified when used. \n\n2. >\"For the dataset from Dreyer et al. (2023), the \u201dacquisition runs\u201d from 33 participants are used for training and stratified 5-fold cross-validation is used to select the best model.\" \n\nWhat variables are changed to select the best model? Is it the model architecture? Are hyperparameters tuned at all?\n\n3. Although this passage is from the \"2.4.1 Cross-Session Condition\", it seems to imply that the train-test split is not split across sessions: \n>\"For the BCI IV IIa dataset, the data from all nine participants is divided into five folds with stratified cross-validation; each fold in the iteration is considered as a test set while the other set is split with an 80-20 ratio to choose the best-performing model on the validation set.\" \n\nThe original work for the BCI competition seems to imply that there are two sessions for each subject. Is there a reason that evaluation across sessions does not seem to be done in the current work?\n\n4. In Table 1, EEGNet without the HyperNet seems to have 4 to 6 times the standard deviation as EEGNet with the HyperNet. Is there an explanation for this, especially when compared to how the ratio of the standard deviation seems to be much closer to 1 for Tables 2 and 3? If the same test in Table 1 is run with multiple seeds and using different subjects (not just the last 9 subjects) as the test set, would we still see such high variation across multiple folds for EEGNet without the HyperNet? \n\n5. For a practical control interface during deployment, it seems unclear when the resting state would occur, which is the input used in the HyperNet. Would a separate resting state classifier have to be used? Or would some other heuristic to determine resting state be sufficient?\n\n6. What is the current state of the art in terms of performance for these two datasets for the metrics you evaluated?"
