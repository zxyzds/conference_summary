    "title": "Bridging the Gap between Database Search and \\emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with SearchNovo",
    "abstract": "Accurate protein identification from mass spectrometry (MS) data is fundamental to unraveling the complex roles of proteins in biological systems, with peptide sequencing being a pivotal step in this process. The two main paradigms for peptide sequencing are database search, which matches experimental spectra with peptide sequences from databases, and \\emph{de novo} sequencing, which infers peptide sequences directly from MS without relying on pre-constructed database. Although database search methods are highly accurate, they are limited by their inability to identify novel, modified, or mutated peptides absent from the database. In contrast, \\emph{de novo} sequencing is adept at discovering novel peptides but often struggles with missing peaks issue, further leading to lower precision. We introduce SearchNovo, a novel framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of database search and \\emph{de novo} sequencing to enhance peptide sequencing. SearchNovo employs an efficient search mechanism to retrieve the most similar peptide spectrum match (PSM) from a database for each query spectrum, followed by a fusion module that utilizes the reference peptide sequence to guide the generation of the target sequence. Furthermore, we observed that dissimilar (noisy) reference peptides negatively affect model performance. To mitigate this, we constructed pseudo reference PSMs to minimize their impact. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that SearchNovo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Also, analysis indicates that many retrieved spectra contain missing peaks absent in the query spectra, and the retrieved reference peptides often share common fragments with the target peptides. These are key elements in the recipe for SearchNovo\u2019s success. The code for reproducing the results are available in the supplementary materials.",

SearchNovo combines two main paradigms in computational proteomics: database search and de novo sequencing. Inspired by the success of retrieval-augmented generation, the authors propose a new transformer-based architecture that predicts a peptide sequence given its MS/MS spectrum and a reference peptide sequence corresponding to the most similar spectrum in a database. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated empirically on three datasets across multiple metrics. Additionally, the authors discuss why SearchNovo outperforms purely de novo approaches, providing clear qualitative results. The text is well-written and easy to follow.

However, the architecture of SearchNovo does not appear to use the retrieved spectra as input but only the peptide sequence corresponding to the most similar spectrum. It is unclear how the model mitigates the issue of missing peaks without directly incorporating the retrieved spectra.\n\n- Although the authors explain their choice not to include database retrieval baselines, this would be very valuable. Specifically, the authors could show the performance of assigning a sequence to a spectrum based solely on matchms (e.g., using a k-NN classifier with matchms as a metric). As Table 3 suggests, such a model could still achieve high per-amino-acid metrics. Although it may not achieve non-zero per-peptide metrics, it would still provide context on the extent to which the de novo component contributes to the model's performance. Without such results, it is not clear how, for example, the change of the database for retrieval would affect the performance."

Did the authors experiment with simpler approaches that replace this additional hyperparameter, perhaps by directly using matchms similarity? While the similarity is used in Equation 6, using it, for example, to weight the second term in Equation 8 might provide a more straightforward approach.\n\n- The computational efficiency results in Table 6 provide a valuable complement to the performance metrics presented in the main text. Since the model employs a database search, one could think that it would be significantly slower than the purely de novo methods. I suggest mentioning these results in the main text for added emphasis."

For example, focusing on the \u201cNine-species\u201d dataset, both reported precision and AUPRC differ significantly.\n- Comparing de novo methods with hybrid (de novo + database search) methods is challenging, as all homologous sequences must be removed from the training/reference sets.

A more balanced test set could involve immunopeptidome or metaproteomes.\n- I find the underlying mechanics of the proposed model insufficiently explained; a toy example would have helped (e.g., Fig. 1 of Yilmaz et al., 2022, is a good template).\n- Equation (2) represents the negative log-likelihood, not cross-entropy. \n- Although dataset versions differ as outlined in Section A.3, the drop in peptide-level precision\u2014from 0.81 to 0.481 for Casanovo and from 0.74 to 0.480 for PointNovo (the former metrics reported by Yilmaz et al., 2022)\u2014is concerning.\n- The peak encoder (Section A.1) seems heavily inspired by (if not identical to) Yilmaz et al., 2022, and maybe I am missing something, but I don\u2019t see appropriate attribution.\n- The authors could improve reliability by using bootstrapping to compute confidence intervals or standard deviations.\n\n**Minor points**\n- \u201cde novo\u201d should always appear together without breaking across lines; perhaps \\emph{de~novo} would help.\n- References in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d do not fully represent recent developments in MS/MS data analysis, especially for database search methods.\n- In line 160, \u201cPTM\u201d is used before it is defined in line 213.\n- In line 188, is the beam search citation correct? \u201c(Science, 1977)\u201d\n- In Fig. 3, both \u201cPEPTID\u201d and \u201cPEITED\u201d are misspelled at the top of the figure.\n- Some sections (e.g., 5.3 and 5.4) begin with table captions rather than text.\n- In Eq.

Is there a deeper reason?\n\n- it is not clear to me what database information is provided to searchnovo in the various benchmark. In particular, what is the size of the database and to which extend are related sequences filtered out (are only absolutely identical ones filtered out or also those containing PTMs/chemical modifications/single amino acid substitions)?\n\n- can the authors compare to an error-tolerant/open database search approach (eg msfragger as current de facto gold standard in the field)? It could make sense to replicate a common scenario, e.g. in the 7/9 species setup that I can provide a complete database of the closed related organism. To give an example, human and chicken are evolutionary 300 million years apart, but it has been shown that error-tolerant approaches can overcome that distance, so unless going for very obscure organisms, there are related species available and that should be the starting point.\n\n- for practical purposes in proteomics, reliability is a key issue and the setup of the benchmark is of limited use for proteomics applications. Most mass spectra are of low quality and redundance of measurements is very high (almost all proteins are identified based on multiple spectra).  It is common standard (and even required for publications in practically all venues of the field) that peptide identifications are at least above a 1% false discovery rate threshold. Currently the authors only provide precision/recall metrics, which does not allow judging the number of peptide that the search algorithm itself considers reliable \u2013 it is by no means necessary that each spectrum is identified. Can the authors provide in addition a number of peptides above 1% FDR."
