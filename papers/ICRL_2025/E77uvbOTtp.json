    "title": "CFG++: Manifold-constrained Classifier Free Guidance for Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a fundamental tool in modern diffusion models for text-guided generation. Although effective, CFG has notable drawbacks. For instance, DDIM with CFG lacks invertibility, complicating image editing; furthermore, high guidance scales, essential for high-quality outputs, frequently result in issues like mode collapse. Contrary to the widespread belief that these are inherent limitations of diffusion models, this paper reveals that the problems actually stem from the off-manifold phenomenon associated with CFG, rather than the diffusion models themselves. More specifically, inspired by the recent advancements of diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS),  we reformulate text-guidance as an inverse problem with a text-conditioned score matching loss and develop CFG++, a novel approach that tackles the off-manifold challenges inherent in traditional CFG. CFG++ features a surprisingly simple fix to CFG, yet it offers significant improvements, including better sample quality for text-to-image generation, invertibility, smaller guidance scales,  reduced etc. Furthermore, CFG++ enables seamless interpolation between unconditional and conditional sampling at lower guidance scales, consistently outperforming traditional CFG at all scales. Moreover, CFG++ can be easily integrated into the high-order diffusion solvers and naturally extends to distilled diffusion models. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly enhances performance in text-to-image generation, DDIM inversion, editing, and solving inverse problems, suggesting a wide-ranging impact and potential applications in various fields that utilize text guidance.

In Fig. 6, however, the images appear edited with $w=0$ indicating some contradiction.\n* The ImageReward metric is not defined. The FID and CLIP metrics are very similar between CFG and CFG++ especially when using SD v1.5. In Tab. 1 the FID and CLIP are also very close for both methods. This tends to indicate that the gains are relatively marginal even in a low NFE setting.   \n* The statement that the proposed CFG++ is invertible and brings more diversity in the generation is not evaluated.\n\n**Typos**\n\n* The variable $x_c$ is not introduced in line 228\n* Table 1., column 2, Clip score arrow does not show the correct direction\n* line 238 ``a crucial difference in the **renoising** process'' shoulnd't it be denoising?"

The authors provide extensive quantitative and qualitative results to show the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n3. **Intriguing Derivation and Analysis**: The derivation of CFG++ is intriguing by treating text-conditioned generation as an inverse problem and utilizing SDS as the loss function. Moreover, the authors present various perspectives to analyze CFG++, including manifold geometry, score matching loss throughout the denoising process, and the evolution of the posterior mean. These analyses are insightful and helpful in understanding the underlying mechanisms of CFG++.\n\n4. **Simple Yet Widely Applicable Method**: The proposed method essentially modifies the re-noising process of the original CFG, but it achieves improvements across various downstream tasks and could be potentially effective for other tasks relevant to the ICLR community. Additionally, the DDIM solver, as well as other popular diffusion solvers like EDM and DPM-Solver, are derived, establishing CFG++ as a general method."

Could you please **provide some similar derivations for the recent flow matching-based generative models, such as SD3 and FLUX**? I believe similar conclusions stand for flow-based methods, and it will make this work more comprehensive.\n\n2. Is it possible to **disentangle two noises used in the denoising and renoising process**? For example, we can set different hyperparameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ for $(\\epsilon_c-\\epsilon)$, and use this term in different weights for denoising and renoising respectively. Setting $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2$ is the same as CFG and setting $\\lambda_2=0$ is the same as CFG++.\n\n3. Is it possible to **provide derivations of CFG++ for other diffusion solvers**, except DDIM? Extensions of CFG++ to other solvers in Appendix A are more like intuitive understanding, rather than derivations from inverse problems and SDS loss, as done for DDIM.\n\n4. Essentially, **CFG++ can be written as reweighted CFG whose $\\omega$ varies along the sampling process** (let $s\\coloneqq t-1$ and $\\epsilon\\coloneqq \\epsilon_\\emptyset$ for easier LaTeX rendering in OpenReview):\n\n- For DDIM CFG: $$\\mathbf{x}_s=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\mathbf{x}_t-\\frac{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}-\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}(\\omega\\epsilon_c-(\\omega-1)\\epsilon)$$\n\n- For DDIM CFG++: $$\\mathbf{x}_s=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\mathbf{x}_t-\\frac{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}(\\lambda\\epsilon_c-(\\lambda-1)\\epsilon)+\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s}\\epsilon$$\n$$=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\mathbf{x}_t-\\frac{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}-\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}(\\frac{\\lambda\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}-\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\epsilon_c-\\frac{(\\lambda-1)\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}+\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}-\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\epsilon)$$\n\nSo, $$\\omega=\\frac{\\lambda\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}}{\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)\\bar{\\alpha}_s}-\\sqrt{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_s)\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}.$$\n\nAs discussed in Sec. 5, previous studies also propose adjusting the guidance scale across timesteps. However, it may be incorrect to claim that \"these findings are orthogonal to ours and keep the sampling trajectory the same ... CFG++ is designing a different trajectory\"."

                "value": "One notable weakness is the limited scope of experiments presented. While the authors provide comparative results demonstrating the efficacy of CFG++, the evaluation primarily focuses on specific datasets or tasks. To enhance the robustness of their claims, the authors could include a broader range of benchmarks across diverse domains. For instance, incorporating tasks from different image generation contexts (e.g., artistic style transfer, super-resolution) would provide a more comprehensive assessment of CFG++\u2019s performance and generalizability. The authors should extend their experimental framework to include varied datasets and tasks, thereby demonstrating the versatility and applicability of CFG++ in different settings.\n\n\nAlthough the paper claims improvements over prior methods, it lacks a detailed comparison with a broader array of state-of-the-art techniques in diffusion models. For example, a comparison with models like **Stable Diffusion** or recent advancements in **Guided Diffusion** could contextualize the advantages of CFG++ more clearly.  The authors should include direct comparisons with a wider selection of contemporary approaches, utilizing standardized metrics (such as FID scores) to provide a clearer understanding of CFG++\u2019s standing in the current landscape.\n\nWhile the paper introduces the concept of manifold constraints and off-manifold behavior, the theoretical underpinnings could be further strengthened. The authors briefly mention these concepts but do not provide a rigorous mathematical framework that details how CFG++ operates under these constraints or why these adjustments yield better results. A more thorough theoretical analysis, including mathematical proofs or derivations that illustrate the benefits of operating within manifold constraints, would bolster the paper's credibility and understanding.\n\n\nThe paper does not address how CFG++ scales with increasing model size or complexity. As generative models continue to grow, understanding how CFG++ performs under these conditions is crucial. There is a lack of discussion regarding potential computational overhead or challenges in real-world applications. Including analyses or experiments that assess the scalability of CFG++ with larger models or datasets, along with a discussion on computational efficiency, would provide valuable insights for practitioners considering its application.\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on quantitative metrics, such as image quality, but does not incorporate user-centric evaluations. Assessments based on human judgment, such as user studies to evaluate the perceived quality or usefulness of generated images, could provide a more holistic view of CFG++\u2019s effectiveness.  The authors should consider conducting qualitative studies where human evaluators assess the output of CFG++ compared to other methods. This could provide insights into the model's real-world applicability and user satisfaction.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the paper \"CFG++: Manifold-Constrained Classifier-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models\" presents significant contributions, addressing these weaknesses would enhance its overall impact and clarity. By broadening experimental evaluations, strengthening theoretical foundations, and considering scalability and user-centric perspectives, the authors can more effectively support their claims and goals."
