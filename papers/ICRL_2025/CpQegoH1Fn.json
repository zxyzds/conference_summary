    "abstract": "This study proposes a method for infusing human knowledge into neural networks.\nThe primary objective of this study is to build a mechanism that allows neural networks to learn not only from data but also from humans. This motivation is triggered by the fact that human knowledge, experience, personal preferences, and other subjective characteristics are not necessarily easy to mathematically formulate or present as structured data, hindering them from being learned by neural networks. This study is made possible by a neural network model with a two-dimensional topological hidden representation, Restricted Radial Basis Function (rRBF) network. The hidden layer's low dimensionality allows humans to visualize the internal representation of the neural network and thus intuitively understand its characteristics. In this study, the topological layer is further utilized to allow humans to organize it considering their subjective similarities criterion for the inputs. Hence, the infusion of human knowledge, experience, and preference occurs during this process that initializes the rRBF. The subsequent learning process of rRBF ensures that the infused knowledge is inherited during and after the learning process, thus generating a unique neural network that benefits from human knowledge. The infusion can be executed in two different stages of neural network training: the initialization before learning and the post-training correction. This study contributes to the new field of human-in-the-loop AI, which aims to allow humans to participate in AI's learning process or decision-making. Knowledge infusion broadens the scope of human participation in human-in-the-loop AI, usually limited to arranging the training curriculum or participating in the decision-making process. The proposed method is tested against real-world problems of Alzheimer's detection from MRI images.",

                "value": "Thank you very much for your constructive questions.\nWe will try to fix the weaknesses of this work before the submission deadline.\n\nAs for your questions, our point-to-point responses are as follows.\n\nQ1: Why do you need the rRBF and can't just run the experiments in a regular NN.\nR1: We need to do the knowledge infusion in rRBF because the two-dimensional topological hidden layer of the rRBF offers us an intuitive understanding of the hidden representations, i.e., similar high-dimensional inputs are positioned close to each other, while dissimilar inputs are distanced on the map. This understanding allows humans to infuse their subjective knowledge by making topological arrangements on the map. These arrangments cannot be done on the regular NN, for example, DNN, where the hidden representations are not interpretable by humans.  We will add this explanation in the revised version of our paper.\n\nQ2: How $\\Lambda$ does if instead of having the human input in the initialization you have it after the training? \nR2: We already showed the difference between  $\\Lambda$  before and after the training, as the heatmaps in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. The heatmaps in Fig. 3 are the visualization of the initial $\\Lambda$, while the heatmaps in Fig. 5 are the visualizations of the \"revised\" $\\Lambda$  after the retraining. Your question makes us aware that this important point needs to be added to our explanation. We will add more explanation about this point. Thank you very much.\n\nQ3: Figure should be self contained. \nR3: We will correct this point in the revised paper."

However, the study would benefit from broader experimental validation across other tasks or datasets to assess the generalizability of the HITL rRBF approach. Applying this framework to different domains, especially those where data interpretation is less subjective, could help confirm the flexibility and robustness of the method.\n   \n2. **Baseline Comparisons**:\n\n   Although the paper includes comparisons to non-HITL models, such as standard CNNs, it could be strengthened by including additional HITL benchmarks. For instance, other recent HITL approaches, or self-organizing map-based methods, could serve as complementary baselines. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of how the proposed model stands in comparison to existing HITL techniques.\n\n3. **Depth of Analysis on Human Knowledge Infusion**:\n\n   While the paper demonstrates that human initialization improves model performance, the impact of specific types of human input (e.g., different expertise levels or subjective biases) is not explored in depth. Understanding how variations in human knowledge influence the model could clarify the boundaries and limitations of the infusion method, especially for practical deployment in diverse real-world applications.\n\n4. **Reproducibility and Scalability**:\n\n   The paper states that the rRBF method relies on human organization of inputs, which raises questions about scalability for larger datasets. Addressing how the method could be adapted to datasets where human organization is not feasible, or discussing a hybrid approach combining human knowledge with automated processes, could enhance the method\u2019s practicality."

This paper presents an attempt that can be positively evaluated in this regard. Although the study is limited to a classification problem, it could potentially be extended to broader applications, including reinforcement learning.\n\n2. The mathematical formulation and flow in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 are relatively clear, which may benefit readers with diverse backgrounds.\n\n3. Conducting experiments using complex, real-world medical imaging data is a reasonable approach, as it demonstrates the robustness of the proposed method.\n\n4.

                "value": "1. The authors state that the aim of this study is not to develop state-of-the-art models (Line 64). To acknowledge the contribution of this study, however, it is necessary to introduce a novel concept (an innovative methodology or rigorous human behavioral experiment results). These contributions, however, appear somewhat lacking. For example, the learning process of a network similar to SOM is known as a clustering process that corresponds to the high-dimensional space. If CRSOM identifies clusters that align with the arbitrary classified samples by the initializer, the authors' methodology could simply be considered a variant of SOM adapted to human prior knowledge (i.e., an application case).\n\n2. As I understand only six subjects participated in the experiment. Given that the subjects were laypersons rather than experts, it is feasible to recruit more participants. However, with only six participants, it is difficult to ascertain the statistical significance of the experimental results.\n\n3. For an experiment involving human subjects, it is necessary to describe the recruitment process, the participants\u2019 characteristics, and whether IRB approval was required for the study, which is currently missing.\n\n4. Even if it is accepted that expert involvement is not necessary at this stage of study, if non-experts evaluated MRI images for similarity, this judgment might not be substantially different from the similarity that an unsupervised learning model, such as an autoencoder, could learn. What if the autoencoder had instead learned and provided similarity information for these images that were then infused into CRSOM, rather than using human initializers? Given the domain of the experimental images, the general knowledge of non-experts could be within the range that the model could deduce independently. Thus, even if knowledge infusion is feasible, further examination may be needed to confirm whether the information infused was indeed uniquely human (i.e., unobtainable by the model itself).\n\n5. There are several inaccuracies or omissions in the presentation. For instance, the figure legends tend to be insufficient. What does CROM refer to in Fig. 4? Is it CRSOM? Even if so, the explanation remains somewhat unclear. Personally, I suggest condensing Fig. 2 and Fig. 7 as they are somewhat disproportionate in size relative to the key information. Instead complementing the text to provide more detail on the human experimental procedures may be recommanded."

If so, is there a reason to differentiate them?\n\n2. Although the objective of this study is not necessarily to propose a high-performance model, from a practical perspective, the proposed methodology underperforms compared to CNN. Would it not be more beneficial to integrate CRSOM into CNN and compare this with a baseline CNN instead?\n\n3. In the main text, should Fig. 6 on line 315 be corrected to Fig. 5?\n\n4. Overall, the figure legends are insufficient. Should the legend in Fig. 4 refer to CRSOM rather than CROM?\n\n5. The legend in Fig. 7 lacks clarity. For example, a clearer term such as \"rRBFs before the human corrections were made\" could replace \"learning.\"\n\n6. While a \"standard CNN\" is mentioned, could you specify what is meant by a \"standard CNN\"?\n\n7. With only six participants, does this study have sufficient statistical power?\n\n8. Has ethical consideration been given to the use of human subjects in this experiment, including IRB approval?\n\n9. In Fig. 3, what does \"upper\" precisely refer to? Does it represent a cognitive similarity metric as perceived by the initializer? If my understanding is correct, would it not be somewhat unnatural for perceived human similarities to appear as uniformly regular grid-like arrangements?"

                "value": "\u2022 The main idea of this paper \u2013 initializing a neural network using a new data representation based on human preferences \u2013 is unrelated to the specific network architecture. The authors focused this study on a single architecture (rRBF), arguing for better interpretability. Yet, all the results presented could have been generated using any kind of deep neural network (CNN, Transformer, MLP, etc.). For instance, Fig. 4 could have been generated using the internal representation of a network at various depths. As reported in Fig. 7, the performance of rRBF is quite low compared to a simple CNN, which could have been expected by its shallow architecture (2 layers). I do not understand why the authors made such a choice and I think it highly limits the current experimental setup used to validate the method. Showing the benefit of their method on different families of DNN would highly improve the experimental design.\n      \n\u2022 My second concern, as expected by the authors, is about the pool of human initializers used to judge image similarities. They are not medical doctors, and their personal opinion about the similarity between two brain MRIs is highly questionable. This is easily seen in Fig. 7 where the model\u2019s performance is no better than a simple CNN when using human judgment for 5 over 6 individuals. I recommend using a pool of medical doctors to perform this task. In this case, it should be interesting to understand the inter-individual differences between image similarities as judged by this pool of doctors. \n      \n\u2022 The authors only performed experiments on a small brain MRI dataset (235 subjects), although they claim a very broad method. Additionally, no statistical tests or cross-validation schemes were performed to evaluate and compare the models (e.g., in Fig. 7). I would first recommend using a much larger dataset (such as ADNI for Alzheimer\u2019s disease) and studying harder tasks (e.g., diagnosing MCI vs AD vs Controls) to clearly show the benefit of using human knowledge in a real-life scenario.\n      \n\u2022 Section 2.1 (describing the rRBF architecture) is unclear and I had to read the original papers from (Hartono, 2015, 2020) to clearly understand all the technical details. Besides, as I mentioned previously, I think the exact architecture is irrelevant in the proposed method and it does not add novelty to the current work (e.g. Fig. 1 is not novel per se as it only describes an rRBF network). I would recommend shortening this section, moving technical details to the appendix and re-focusing on the actual novelty of this work (which is the human infusion technique in Section 2.2)."
