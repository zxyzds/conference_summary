    "title": "Build your own cell: Diffusion Models for Multichannel 3D Microscopy Image Generation",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) cellular morphology is a key indicator of both cellular function and disease states. Despite its importance, understanding the complex relationships between cell shape, treatment conditions, and their biological implications remains a challenge. To address this, we present \"Build Your Own Cell\" (BYOC), a multichannel 3D generative framework that leverages diffusion models for synthesising realistic 3D cell structures. Our model successfully captures the nuanced morphological changes induced by different drug treatments, enabling virtual simulation and screening of cell shapes in response to various conditions. This approach provides a novel tool for accelerating pre-clinical drug development, potentially reducing the time and costs associated with experimental studies.  Moreover, BYOC ensures phenotypic consistency between cell and nucleus volumes, offering high-fidelity reconstructions that can inform downstream analyses such as drug efficacy evaluation and mechanistic studies.",

I would like the authors to provide more backgrounds regarding why they see this problem as important to solve. Also, the experiment section seems a bit brief and weak. The authors compared with several older GAN-based models but lacked comparison with more recent SOTA diffusion-based models. The improvement against MedicalDiffusion in Table 1 looks pretty minor especially for Blebbistatin and Binimetinib groups. The new framework is mostly combining a VQGAN with a multi-channel DDPM in the latent space, and I would like to see at least some sort of ablation study to showcase the importance of having DDPM in the latent space and the usefulness of linking the two modalities together inside the DDPM."

These datasets illustrate that microscopy data often consists of channels that encode multiple organelles and cellular compartments.\n* Lack of 3D predictions: Although the paper claims to be the first to build a 3D generative model of microscopy images, all the presented data is 2D. The authors should show orthogonal slices of generated volumes.\n* Relevance of metrics: Fre \u0301chet Inception Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy seem reasonable.

                "value": "1. How could biological or mechanistic understanding arise from generative models in your context? Can you expand and provide a stronger motivation for this idea?\n2. You mention that \"GANs often struggle with generating coherent latent representations.\" Since GANs do not inherently produce latent representations in the same way as e.g. Variational Autoencoders, could you clarify what \"coherent latent representations\" means in the context of GANs, and how this specifically relates to your proposed method's advantages?\n3. The claim that multiple color channels can be treated as distinct modalities is not clearly explained in my opinion but is crucial to the suggested method. Do you have examples from related work where color channels have been treated as distinct modalities? Could you explain the biological basis for considering cell and nucleus channels as separate modalities?\n4. In Equation 1, are the variables h,w,d the same dimensions as H,W,D? If not, what is their relationship? Similarly, in Equation 2, the depth dimension d seems to be omitted\u2014was this intentional or a typo? Please add a brief explanation of these variables and their relationships directly after the equations.\n5. How does the simultaneous recovery of both channels relate specifically to latent diffusion? Can you provide a specific example or illustration of how the simultaneous recovery process works in your model, and how it differs from standard latent diffusion approaches?\n6. What is the reason for using unquantized embeddings in your framework? If they drift from the codebook vectors, how does this affect the model, and what is the underlying motivation?\n7. In Equation 12, the variable t should be defined. Additionally, in Equation 13, what exactly is \u03bc_\u03b8_cn(\u22c5) computing\u2014only the mean or is there an associated variance? If not, what is the variance of your Gaussian?\n8. There is an existing WNet in medical imaging literature [1]. To avoid confusion, would you consider renaming your model?\n9. Can you provide more precise details about your dual-channel 3D architecture, perhaps with references or a schematic in the supplementary material?\n10. On page 6, you state that attention mechanisms are \"strategically placed\" to focus on regions of interest. Could you elaborate on the strategy behind their placement and how regions of interest are determined?\n11. The numerical differences in Table 1 are hard to interpret without context. Could you explain or hint to what these differences mean in terms of image quality and their significance in your application? Can you provide a brief interpretation guide for the FID and MMD scores, perhaps indicating what range of differences would be considered significant in this context? You could also include a qualitative comparison of images corresponding to different score ranges to help readers understand the practical implications of these differences.\n12. Could you provide more context about the ResNet50 model used\u2014for instance, what type of medical images it was trained on?\n\n**Additional Feedback for Improvement:**\n\n- In Figure 1, please explain what the rows and columns represent to enhance understanding.\n- In the introduction, you mention that \"single-cell data is often high-dimensional and inconsistent in size.\" Could you clarify whether this inconsistency refers to the images, cells, biological structures, or image resolutions?\n- In the Related Work section, the statement about discriminative frameworks needing a \"deep understanding of the underlying input distribution\" is unclear. Providing an example or reference could help clarify this point.\n- It might be beneficial to first introduce and describe the dataset before delving into implementation details like volume padding.\n- Please specify the size and resolution of the microscopy images. Are the single-cell images crops from larger stacks, or are they the direct output from the microscope?\n- Consider citing relevant works such as the 3D U-Net architecture [2] to situate your work within the existing literature.\n- The conclusion would be stronger if it discussed potential methodological developments and acknowledged limitations of the current approach."
