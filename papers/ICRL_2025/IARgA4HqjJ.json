    "title": "Lie Group-Induced Dynamics in Score-Based Generative Modeling",
    "abstract": "We extend score-based generative modeling by incorporating Lie group actions on the data manifold into the denoising diffusion process. Our approach yields a Langevin dynamics whose infinitesimal transformations decompose as a direct sum of Lie algebra representations, enabling generative processes that align with the underlying symmetry properties of the data. Unlike equivariant models, which restrict the space of learnable functions by quotienting out group orbits, our method incorporates both global and local symmetries and can model any target distribution. Standard score-matching, which minimizes the Fisher divergence, emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group in Euclidean space. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of reverse-time stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions, lifting the requirement of a Gaussian prior. Additionally, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by deriving how it extends to flow matching techniques.",

Is the difference that such a map would need to be _global_ whist the flow map here is _local_ (i.e. depends on an $x_0$)?\n\nCould still construct such a generative model without relying on a global diffeomorphism (e.g. Corso et al. (2022), De Bortoli et al. (2022)).

In section 2.2, three conditions are presented as sufficient conditions to use generalized score matching. However, the general feasibility of these conditions is not well discussed. Furthermore, while the general setting assumes the data state space $X$ to be general manifolds, all the examples and calculations in the paper seem to be done in cases where $X$ is essentially Euclidean. This makes me wonder about the applicability of this approach to more general settings.\n\n* The paper does not discuss the tractability of different score matching objectives in the general setting. In lines 293-304, seemingly only settings of Euclidean data are presented, where the generalized conditional score has an analytic closed-form expression. It's unclear how things are if the data space is not Euclidean. \n\n* The numerical experiments, while are important real-world applications, are not performed enough and comparison with benchmarks in the literature are missing. Molecular conformer generation and molecular docking respectively have a rich literature and many of them are based on generative modeling methods.

                "value": "The paper introduces score-based generative models whose solutions abide to some symmetries, known as Lie groups. To achieve this, the authors show that diffusions in a space $ X $, which follow these symmetries, can be expressed using a directional derivative aligned with the symmetry. In particular, they shows that the stochastic differential equations of such diffusions includes a directional derivative of the log-density rather than the standard log-density gradient. Consequently, they propose a method for training the directional scores.\n\nA symmetry group is a set of (closed) transformations on a space $ X $ that maintains certain symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and reflection. Specifically, a Lie group is a symmetry group with continuous symmetries. Each element (transformation/mapping) in a Lie group is known as a (Lie) group action. Since Lie group actions are continuous, they are differentiable with respect to the symmetries, such as rotations or translations. The derivative of a Lie group action is called a Lie algebra action, which is commonly viewed as a linearized form of the group action (analogous to any other derivative).\n\nThe paper highlights that the directional derivative at $ x \\in X $, along group actions, can be represented by what is called the fundamental vector field. The fundamental vector field at $ x \\in X $ is the linear mapping at $ x $, representing the Lie algebra actions (the derivatives of the symmetries) with respect to a basis of $ X $, and it is expressed through exponential mappings of Lie algebra actions. As a result, the directional derivative on $ X $ along the symmetries is defined by the inner product of the fundamental vector field and the ordinary derivative.\n\nWith this derivative representation of using fundamental vector fields, the authors show that forward and reverse diffusions under Lie groups can be represented in terms of the directional derivative of log-density. Based on this, the paper proposes generalized score matching (including a denoising variant) that learns the directional derivative of log-density in a manner similar to standard (denoising) score matching. \n\nThe authors argue that the proposed method offers an advantage by allowing the use of more general network architectures, without the need for designing network structures specifically invariant or equivariant to Lie groups. \n\nFinally, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through various experiments."

However, the paper does an excellent job of explaining how the new differential equation contains directional derivatives along Lie groups and why the directional derivatives to the group action have a Jacobian-like term, i.e., the fundamental vector field.

This class of diffusion model is valid under certain assumptions on the relationship between the group action and the data space. For instance, one must assume that the group action is complete. In that case, the forward diffusion is linked with an (explicit) forward diffusion on the Lie group. In order to learn the quantity appearing in the backward diffusion, they propose a generalized score loss function, which in practice corresponds to a preconditioning of the score function.

                "value": "There are several limitations to this work:\n\n* Lack of baseline experiments: while there is merit in this work I find the lack of baseline experiments to be concerning. There are many existing works on diffusion on Riemannian manifolds and I think a comparison with such works is necessary to assess the applicability of the method. To be more specific, in the case of rotated MNIST, why not compare the performance with a classical diffusion model on MNIST augmented with rotation? Similarly for QM9, why not compare with a diffusion model on QM9 where the QM9 dataset is augmented with the symmetries of the $G = (\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\times \\mathbb{R}_+)^N$ and $G = T(3)^N$. Regarding Section 5.4 on CrossDocked2020, I know that the authors are space limited but I would suggest cutting some other parts of the paper to better explain CrossDocked2020. Such examples are important because, to my understanding, this is the only example in the paper dealing with a dataspace $X$ which is actually different from the classical Euclidean space. In these settings, it would be good to compare to other Riemannian based diffusion models such as [1, 2, 3]\n\n* Motivation and link with existing literature: Looking at Theorem 3.1 I find that this result is extremely related to existing results on latent diffusion, see Section 4.1. of [4]. Broadly speaking, it seems to me that the main result of the paper is to translate a diffusion on a dataspace X to a Lie group G, the same way a bijective function would (or any minimal assumption needed to get a change of variable). The case of a bijective transformation is exactly the one treated in [4]. It would be great to acknowledge that fact if it is indeed the case. I understand that the settings and motivations are different but such works on latent diffusion cannot be ignored. Regarding works on Lie groups, there is a line of work devoted to the implementation of diffusion models on Lie groups, see for instance [5, 6] and references therein. In particular [5] focuses on diffusion models on SE(3) which seems to be related to the application presented in Section 5.4.\nMathematical correctness: I think the paper would highly benefit from a clarification between the general setting of a data space X and the special case of a Euclidean space. Indeed, while I understand that a few conditions are enforced to apply Theorem 3.1 (completeness, homogeneity, commutativity), the central mapping $\\Pi$ should transfer a vector field defined on the Lie algebra of G into a vector field which is a section of the tangent bundle of X. In Theorem 3.1, we have that $\\Pi$ is defined on Euclidean spaces. While there is a local identification between the tangent space of $X$ at any point and a Euclidean space, I am not clear where this is explicit in the paper. A similar remark holds for all the quantities introduced in Theorem 3.1. In general, I found the key quantity $\\Pi$ to be poorly defined. The definition of this quantity given in line 173 \u201cthe collection of fundamental fields $\\Pi$\u201d is not enough to understand how it is defined truly. \n\n*Limitation: I don\u2019t think the limitations of the work are discussed in enough depth. For instance, a central and essential point for the procedure described in the paper to work is the access to the mapping $\\Pi$, its inverse and the ability to compute its determinant (according to the sampling paragraph, \u201cGenerating samples through the reverse SDE\u201d). When is that the case? The authors have presented a few cases when that is possible but one of the crucial assumption is basically that G and X have the same dimensionality (in order to compute the inverse mapping). See Section 5.1, Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 to verify that the examples of the authors match this assumptions. There are many cases where the Lie group acting on the dataspace $X$ is not of the same dimension. In that case it seems very hard, if not impossible, to construct the diffusion process on $G$.\n\n[1] De Bortoli et al. \u2013 Riemannian Score-Based Generative Modelling\n\n[2] Huang et al. \u2013 Riemannian Diffusion Models\n\n[3] Chen and Lipman \u2013 Flow Matching on General Geometries\n\n[4] Kim et al. \u2013 Maximum Likelihood Training of Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion Models"

                "value": "* I might be missing something but I think Vect is TX in (1)\n\n* What is the difference between x and bolded x (for example in (1)).

It is not defined in this section. I am guessing that it is associated to L but for some reason the dependency of L with respect to A is not highlighted.\n\n* Proposition 2.1. Can we have > dim X? This is suggested by the phrasing of Proposition 2.1. If such an example exists please provide it. \n\n* Is homogeneity really important? \u201censure that the Langevin dynamics (5) will behave appropriately,\u201d > what does appropriately mean here. For instance I could think of densities supported on only O_+\n\n* I would move line 173 after Equation (1) to introduce the linear operator right away.\n\n* A more general (open) question is the relevance of constrained generative models. In the light of the new Alphafold paper for instance [1], it seems that constrained generative models do not fare well compared to simpler models fed with a lot of data (and augmentations). I think running such comparisons and explaining the author's stance on this point would be very valuable for the paper and the community. \n\n[1] Abramson et al. \u2013 Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3"
