    "title": "FCoReBench: Can Large Language Models Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial Reasoning Problems?",
    "abstract": "Can the large language models (LLMs) solve challenging first-order combinatorial\nreasoning problems such as graph coloring, knapsack, and cryptarithmetic? By\nfirst-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite\nnumber of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being\nNP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing\nwork has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is\nlimited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To\naddress this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging\nproblems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and\nautomatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even\nwhen aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable\nto leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe\na drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a\nnew approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers\nand program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to\nachieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the\nproblem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during\ninference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also\ndemonstrate SymPro-LM\u2019s effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.",

                "value": "This paper focuses on the problem-solving ability of LLM on first-order combinatorial problems in natural language form, arguing that no existing benchmark could reveal this challange properly. To stress the significance of this issue, this paper proposes a new benchmark, FCoReBench, which covers 40 challanging problems in varying sizes and correspounding solutions. In responding to the poor performance of current LLMs on FCoReBench, this paper further proposes a new framework, SymPro-LM, to push forward the potential capacity of language models by combining symbolic solvers, program interpreters and the LM backbone. The experimental results show a significant improvement in various aspects, indicating the valuable attempt of assembling different augmented modules."

                "value": "- The construction part of the dataset issue in Section 4 requires manual labor, which is quite labor-intensive. Could it be automated using LLM?\n- The current agent can only solve first-order logic. Higher-order logic requires individual generation, which is resource-intensive and difficult to scale.\n- There is a lack of innovation in the proposed framework SymPro-LM, which merely combines existing symbolic solvers and program generation. It would be better to consider a more specific design.\n\nWriting aspects:\n- There are issues with the section layout and organization; the section titles are inconsistent and not uniformly formatted (e.g. section 5 and 5.1, section 7 and 7.1). The table layout on page 7 is also peculiar.\n- The overall language used in writing is subpar, being rather colloquial and informal. E.g.:\n  - In Section 3, as a problem definition, there should not be such an emphasis on the subject \"We.\" The problem should be described objectively and rigorously from a third-party perspective.\n  - In Section 4, the term \"the author\" should be used less frequently to avoid potential privacy issues. Instead, use \"agent\" or \"process\" to emphasize actions rather than the actors, which would be more formal. If necessary, flowcharts can also be used to represent the selection, polishing, and construction processes, which would greatly assist readers in understanding the overall procedures.\n- This paper primarily focuses on the benchmark, as emphasized in the title; thus, the experimental section should mainly focus on verifying the performance of the benchmark in various aspects. The current writing approach is centered around SymPro-LM. If this focus is to be maintained, the emphasis of the entire article should be placed on SymPro-LM."

The task of the LLM therefore becomes translating the pseudo code to python, which does not require the same level of reasoning as solving the problems.\n\nThe paper does not evaluate enough existing models for the new proposed benchmark dataset. For example, the state-of-the-art GPT-4o and GPT-o1 are not evaluated. The paper also include limited analysis of why the existing approaches fail on the proposed dataset. \n\nThe writing and presentation require more clarity and focus. For example, section 7 presents results across different LLM models, different frameworks/styles of prompting, different datasets/problem classes, and different experimental setups. It is unclear to me what the key takeaways from these results are."

It is also formulating the model and offloading the reasoning to a solver similar to the proposed framework.\n\nTable 1: Considering the NP-Hard nature of the problems, how come random guess achieves over 20% accuracy?

                "value": "This paper has several critical issues that require the authors' attention:\n\n1. Misalignment Between Title and Content: While the title suggests a focus on the proposed problem set, the main body primarily discusses the technique, SymPro-LM. After reviewing the entire paper, it appears more as a technique paper rather than a benchmark paper. I suggest revising the title and reorganizing the structure to more accurately reflect its focus on methodology.\n\n2. Lack of Clarity on Incremental Contributions of the Problem Set: Although the problem set seems useful, the paper does not clearly articulate its unique contribution. Existing symbolic-solver-aided LLM approaches have already addressed similar reasoning problems, and some may have been tested on benchmarks containing first-order combinatorial reasoning problems. It is essential to compare the proposed problem set with these existing benchmarks, highlighting overlaps and differences. However, this paper provides limited detail on this aspect.\n\n3. Scope Restriction and Generalizability of the Technique: While the paper narrows its focus to first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, conceptually, the proposed technique has broader applicability across various reasoning tasks. Given the absence of any domain-specific adaptations, I recommend either expanding the paper\u2019s scope and conducting a more comprehensive evaluation across diverse reasoning problems, or explaining the reason of the scope restriction.\n\n4. Use of an Outdated LLM in Evaluation: The LLM used in the evaluations appears a bit outdated. I suggest incorporating recent models, such as GPT-4o and o1, to provide a more relevant assessment.\n\n5. Unclear Criteria for Problem Selection in the Problem Set: The criteria for including specific problems in the problem set are not well-defined. For example, while the paper includes problems from the industry track of SAT competitions, it does not explain the exclusion of others (e.g., the main track). Furthermore, recent SAT competitions no longer feature an industry track, making the rationale for this selection unclear."
