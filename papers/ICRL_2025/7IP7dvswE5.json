    "title": "Rare-Mark-Aware Next Event Prediction In Marked Event Streams",
    "abstract": "In marked event streams, Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) is central to predicting when and what mark the next event will occur based on the history. In various real-world applications, the mark distribution is significantly imbalanced, i.e., some marks are frequent, and others are rare. We unveil that such imbalance can cause the rare mark missing issue when predicting the next event \u2013 frequent marks are dominant, and rare marks often have no chance. However, rare marks can be essential in some applications (e.g., the occurrence of a 7-magnitude earthquake), and missing such rare marks in the next event prediction is risky. To address this issue, we tackle a novel Rare-mark-aware Next Event Prediction problem (RM-NEP), answering two questions for each mark m: \u201cwhat is the probability that the mark of the next event is m?, and if m, when will the next event happen?\u201d. Solving RM-NEP gives rare marks equal opportunity as frequent marks in the next event prediction. This guarantees that rare marks are always included in the predicted results. Moreover, RM-NEP allows arbitrary number of rare marks samples for time prediction without interference from frequent marks, ensuring the time prediction is accurate. To solve RM-NEP effectively, we first unify the improper integration of two different functions into one and then develop a novel Integral-free Neural Marked Temporal Point Process (IFNMTPP) to approximate the target integral directly. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution for RM-NEP against various baselines.",

(i) If a mark is rare (i.e., it occurs very few times in the history). Then, it can be dominated by frequent marks in the prediction. This phenomenon is completely normal.  (ii) If a mark is rare and important compared to other marks, why don\u2019t we only consider that mark as a single variable so that there is no imbalance anymore?\n3.\tThe paper is not self-contained. For example, how the existing studies solve NEP is not clear. The authors only list a large number of papers in the Related Work section. Similarly, how the existing studies model MTPP is not clear. The authors only list a large number of papers in the Introduction section. A summarization and comparison are needed to provide a better understanding.\n4.\tSome words are hard to understand. For example, RMTPP is not defined.\n5.\tSome notations are not defined.
