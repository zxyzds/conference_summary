    "abstract": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) are powerful and efficient models for density estimation. When modeling densities on manifolds, NFs can be generalized to injective flows but the Jacobian determinant becomes computationally prohibitive. Current approaches either consider bounds on the log-likelihood or rely on some approximations of the Jacobian determinant. In contrast, we propose injective flows for star-like manifolds and show that for such manifolds we can compute the Jacobian determinant exactly and efficiently, with the same cost as NFs. This aspect is particularly relevant for variational inference settings, where no samples are available and only some unnormalized target is known. Among many, we showcase the relevance of modeling densities on star-like manifolds in two settings. Firstly, we introduce a novel Objective Bayesian approach for penalized likelihood models by interpreting level-sets of the penalty as star-like manifolds. Secondly, we consider probabilistic mixing models and introduce a general method for variational inference by defining the posterior of mixture weights on the probability simplex.",

I believe Fig. 2 does not significantly aid in understanding the proposed approach, and a more intuitive figure could better illustrate the concept of the injective flow graphically. Additionally, moving the proof sketch to the appendix could free up space for a more intuitive figure(s), details on the mappings considered (e.g., as in Appendix A.5), and discussions on variational inference, maximum likelihood, and additional experiments.\n\nQ2. The proposed approach appears to rely on the circular bijective layers of Rezende et al. (2020); a brief description in the appendix would be helpful. How does this approach scale in higher dimensions, and is this critical to the proposed approach?\n\nQ3. Regarding experiment 5.1, is it possible that the density effectively modeled through the spherical flows (circular bijective layers) used for the transformation $\\mathcal{T}_{\\theta}$?\n\nQ4. It would be interesting to include some (synthetic 2D or 3D) experiments where the manifold is more complicated, such as variational inference problems with a posterior concentrated on a star-shaped manifold, where $r(\\theta)$ is potentially a learnable function.\n\nQ5. Minor: What is meant by the density will be expressed in Cartesian coordinates (line 160)? Does this simply mean that the push-forward samples $x$ are just points in the ambient space?"

Since the method applies to a very specific class of manifolds instead of a more general class, the benefits for this specific class need to be greater to warrant acceptance into ICLR, in my opinion\n2. The numerical examples seem limited (as a result of 1). To justify this approach, more examples of star-shaped manifolds and real-world applications should be presented and/or the benefit of the method over normal normalizing flows should be significant."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main critic on the paper is the missing comparison to existing injective flows. The authors emphasize at several points of the paper that it is important to have density evaluations of the model which are i) exact and ii) have improved complexity. As outlined in the literature part of the authors, there exist plenty of methods meeting one of the properties i) or ii). To validate the importance of meeting both at the same time, I would suggest two experiments:\n\ni) Run an experiments to fit a not too simple distribution on a star-like manifold (maybe something like Fig 3b) and train an injective flow once with naive O(d^3) evaluation of the change-of-variables formula and once with the formula proposed in Thm 1. Then, create a plot of execution time vs dimension.\n\nii) Run an experiment in a similar setup for variational inference. Train an injective flow with exact determinant (as proposed) and some approximate determinant (e.g., one of the models which are cited in the related-work part) and compare the quality of generated samples (e.g. in Wasserstein/MMD or a similar two-sample comparison of distributions). Following the authors claims, the injective flow with exact determinant should lead to more accurate results than the approximate.\n\nEven though the existing numerical experiments provide some proof-of-concept, I think that the paper could benefit a lot by evaluating more the proposed architecture itself in terms of speed and accuracy instead of using it for specific applications. The comparison with the completely different MCMC samplers looks a bit out of place since it is a completely different model which is known not to scale well along the dimensions (which is also observed in Fig 9).\n\nAdditionally, I would like to point the authors to the papers [1,2]. [1] considers a specific architectures which makes the evaluation of the necessary determinant cheap and easy, [2] which trains the normalizing flows with a VAE loss.\n\nFrom a technical side, I am bit confused since the change from spherical to Cartesian coordinates is not a bijection and definitely not a diffeomorphism. The vectors $(0,\\theta_2,...,\\theta_{d-1},1)$ map all to the same point in the $\\mathbb{R}^d$ regardless of the choice of $\\theta_2,...,\\theta_{d-1}$. Certainly, one can exclude sets of measure zero from domain and image of this transformation such that it becomes bijective, but then still the determinant of this transform becomes arbitrary close to zero when $\\theta_1$ approaches zero such that the inverse is no longer a $C^1$-function (and hence the embedding not a $C^1$ diffeomorphism). I am not completely sure if this can cause limitations in actual applications. But the issue should be treated more thoroughly in the paper. In fact, it is easy to see that there exists no diffeomporphism from $\\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ to a sphere (or any other star-like manifold) since those have different topologies (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ is contractible in contrast to star-like manifolds). A possible way to overcome such issue is the use of a mixture of several embeddings (for star-like manifolds two should be enough), see [3]. As the authors do not need too many geometrical properties of their embedding an \"we exclude zero sets\"-solution might be enough, but again, this issue should be discussed in the paper.\n\nIn summary, I think some numerical comparisons to existing works are necessary such that I think that the paper is below the acceptance threshhold, but I am willing to raise my score if the critics from above is addressed.\n\n\n[1] Kothari et al. \"Trumpets: Injective Flows for Inference and Inverse Problems\", UAI 2021\n\n[2] Chen et al.
