    "title": "PhyloVAE: Unsupervised Learning of Phylogenetic Trees via Variational Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "Learning informative representations of phylogenetic tree structures is essential for analyzing evolutionary relationships. Classical distance-based methods have been widely used to project phylogenetic trees into Euclidean space, but they are often sensitive to the choice of distance metric and may lack sufficient resolution. In this paper, we introduce *phylogenetic variational autoencoders* (PhyloVAEs), an unsupervised learning framework designed for representation learning and generative modeling of tree topologies. Leveraging an efficient encoding mechanism inspired by autoregressive tree topology generation, we develop a deep latent-variable generative model that facilitates fast, parallelized topology generation. PhyloVAE combines this generative model with a collaborative inference model based on learnable topological features, allowing for high-resolution representations of phylogenetic tree samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate PhyloVAE's robust representation learning capabilities and fast generation of phylogenetic tree topologies.",

                "value": "PhyloVAE adopts the architecture of variational autoencoders and is specially designed to handle phylogenetic tree topologies. It maps any point in the latent space to a specific tree topology, and this architecture makes it excel at distinguishing between different tree shapes, outperforming traditional distance-based methods. Moreover, PhyloVAE's generative property, which enables the mapping of any point in the latent space to a specific tree topology, is an important advantage over other models that lack this functionality. This property enhances the visualization and interpretability of the learned representation."

To my knowledge, a variational autoencoder is applied to the representation learning of phylogenetic trees for the first time, demonstrating the potential of deep learning methods in this field.\n\n* **(S2)** This paper is overall easy to follow to some extent (but also has some drawbacks, as mentioned weaknesses). The model architecture and training process are described in detail, especially the mapping function in potential space and visualization of tree topology.\n\n* **(S3)** The effectiveness of PhyloVAE is fully verified through experiments, especially its performance in dealing with complex tree structures, which shows the advantages over traditional distance-based and density-based estimation methods.

How was this proven through experiments and theatrical analysis? Meanwhile, the authors mention that *their effectiveness heavily depends on the choice of distance metric and can sometimes exhibit counterintuitive behaviors*. What specifically does this counterintuitive behavior refer to?\n\n* **(W2)** The specific application scenarios described in the manuscript are vague. Although the importance of tree visualization is emphasized in the intro and abs sections, the main goal of the model is not clearly distinguished between representation learning and generative modeling. I suggest the authors further clarify the core goal of the proposed methods (or tackled problem) in the introduction section and clearly distinguish the relationship between representation learning and generative modeling. Meanwhile, the author might provide a specific discussion on the potential use of the model in different application scenarios to enhance the logic and practical significance of the manuscript.\n\n* **(W3)** This paper mentions the limitations of distance-based and density-based estimation methods. Still, it lacks an in-depth analysis of the PhyloVAE model settings to clarify its advantages in representation learning and visualization. What model settings or methods can perform well in representation learning and visualization?\n\n* **(W4)** More minor issues could be clarified:\n  - **(a)** What is the impact of different phylogenetic inference software choices?\n  - **(b)** Why is the formula for the data distribution in line 157? Are there any a priori constraints?\n  - **(c)** The simulated dataset used in the experiments in Section 5.1 only contains tree topologies with five and eight-leaf nodes, and experiments on large-scale tree structures are lacking.\n  - **(d)** The paper does not clearly explain the specific generation process of the tree topologies in the experiments in Section 5.1.\n  - **(e)** The paper's formula 3 has a variable K, and so does line 346. Do they represent the same variable?"

Why is this operation a disadvantage? And what are the shortcomings of the MDS method in representing tree space?\n\n* **(Q2)** The encoding mechanism in Section 3.2 is clearly written, but there is a potential problem:\n\n  - **(a)** In the Decomposition stage, when selecting edge e_n, the conditional probability $Q(e_n | e_{<n})$ is based on the selected edge set e_{<n}. As the depth of the tree and the number of edges increases, the calculation of the conditional probability may become complicated.\n  - **(b)** In the Reconstruction stage, if an error occurs in the previous Decomposition process, the reconstructed tree may not be consistent with the original tree. How should this be corrected?\n\n* **(Q3)** The paper claims that PhyloVAE is \u2018the first representation learning framework that targets the topology of phylogenetic trees\u2019, but existing methods such as VBPI-GNN also have representation learning capabilities. This statement lacks discussion and comparison with relevant existing work, making its claim of innovation seem less rigorous and may make readers question the contribution of the article. Similarly, why not compare with baselines?\n\n* **(Q4)** Where is the hyper-parameter experiment, e.g., how to decide the parameters $d$, $K$, $L$, Iterations, and batch size?"

Highly Relevant and Practical Topic: The paper addresses the generation and representation of phylogenetic trees, a critical problem in evolutionary and computational biology. By introducing an unsupervised generative model, the paper offers a novel approach for analyzing complex evolutionary relationships. This work is practically significant as it enables researchers to gain deeper insights into biological evolutionary paths and diversity, advancing the field substantially.\n2. Significant Efficiency Gains: PhyloVAE achieves efficient phylogenetic tree generation through its non-autoregressive design, enabling faster and parallelized tree structure generation. Compared to traditional stepwise generation methods, this improvement is especially meaningful for handling large-scale biological data, accelerating the computational process and enhancing the model\u2019s feasibility and applicability in real-world scenarios."

                "value": "1. Need for Generalizability Testing Across Datasets: The paper primarily focuses on evaluating PhyloVAE across different benchmark datasets (DS1-DS8) without testing its generalizability across distinct datasets. For example, testing a model trained on DS1-DS4 and then assessing its performance on DS5 would offer insight into the model\u2019s robustness across varied evolutionary patterns. Such cross-dataset evaluations are crucial for demonstrating the model\u2019s applicability beyond specific training sets.\n2. Lack of Comparison with True Phylogenetic Trees: While PhyloVAE performs well in capturing tree structures, there is no direct comparison between the generated phylogenetic trees and real, experimentally derived species trees. This comparison would help validate the biological relevance of the model\u2019s output by assessing how closely PhyloVAE\u2019s generated trees align with known evolutionary relationships. In-depth analysis of these discrepancies would offer valuable insights into the model\u2019s accuracy.\n3. Marginal Improvements in Performance Metrics: The paper demonstrates efficiency gains in tree generation time but does not show substantial improvements in accuracy metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. As shown in Table 1, while PhyloVAE\u2019s performance is comparable, it does not significantly outperform traditional models like ARTree in KL divergence to ground truth trees. This raises questions about the trade-offs made between efficiency and accuracy in the model\u2019s design."

                "value": "1. How does PhyloVAE perform when trained on one set of datasets (e.g., DS1-DS4) and tested on a distinct dataset like DS5? Could the authors provide insights or additional experiments to demonstrate the model\u2019s robustness across varied evolutionary patterns? Cross-dataset evaluations would enhance the assessment of PhyloVAE\u2019s broader applicability. To make this clearer, could the authors also analyze specific aspects of the datasets\u2014such as the number of species, evolutionary rates, or tree shapes\u2014that might influence generalization performance? Additionally, specific metrics or visualizations for comparing performance across datasets would help clarify how different components, like the encoding mechanism or the inference model, contribute to the model\u2019s generalizability.\n2. Has PhyloVAE been directly compared to real, experimentally derived species trees? Such a comparison could provide essential validation for the model\u2019s biological relevance by examining how closely the generated trees align with established evolutionary relationships. Could the authors explore potential discrepancies between PhyloVAE-generated trees and actual species trees and analyze their implications for the model\u2019s accuracy? Including specific datasets or types of experimentally derived trees, as well as visualization techniques or metrics, would help quantify and illustrate these similarities and differences.\n3. While PhyloVAE offers efficiency gains, it appears not to outperform traditional models like ARTree in terms of accuracy metrics, as noted in Table 1\u2019s KL divergence comparisons. Could the authors clarify the trade-offs made between efficiency and accuracy in the model design, and whether further refinements might enhance both speed and accuracy? A detailed analysis of how specific model components or hyperparameters affect this trade-off would be helpful. For example, it would be insightful to explore how increasing the latent space dimension or adjusting the number of particles in importance sampling impacts both computational efficiency and accuracy (e.g., KL divergence). These investigations could offer valuable directions for potential model refinements."

In [1; Fig. 5] the posterior coverage of the pre-computed topologies was evaluated and compared with those obtained from MrBayes. Can you provide a similar quantification? It might even suffice to merely reference their work to guard aganst the common suspicion that pre-computed tree topoplogies are not good representations. \n\n* On the same topic, in Sec. 5.2 the topologies are gathered from a 1 milion MCMC run, but this is not this quite short, in order to ensure that the samples are coming from the posterior?  To be clear, I do not think that it is an issue to learn posteriors over a pre-computed set of topologies, if the set of topologies is a good representation of the true posterior's support.\n\n* The collection of trees are tuples of the topologies and their corresponding weights. The weights are then in a footnote described to be the frequency of the topology (right?). Then in all experiments, the weights are explicitly mentioned to be uniform. Why is this? Is a topology never sampled more than once in the pre-processing stage? What would happen if the trees were weighted by scores obtained, for instance, from MrBayes? Or simply the Felsenstein likelihood of the topology, normalized over all samples.\n\n* Recently there have been works for applying mixtures of variational distributions in VAEs [2], phylogenetic posterior inference [3] as well as in VAEs *and* phylogenetics [4] (note that [4] does not propose a VAE for phylogenetics, but applies mixtures in both settings). I think at least [3] and [4] should be mentioned in the list of works referenced at line 463 to emphasize the great, current interest in Bayesian phylogenetics at ML conferences. \n\n## Minor\n* There is a clash of notations for $w$ notating both internal node connections in Sec. 3.2 and the weights of the tree topologies.\n\n* I would be good to disambiguate the proposed method to other tree-based VAEs such as [5, 6] and [7] (although [7] appears to not be published).
