    "title": "TopER: Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Graph embeddings serve as the cornerstone for graph representation learning, facilitating the exploration of graphs by machine learning methods. However, prevalent deep learning techniques rely on black-box, high-dimensional graph embeddings. There is a pressing need for an interpretable, low-dimensional embedding approach to empower efficient graph visualization and provide practical tools to study graph datasets effectively.\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel low-dimensional graph embedding method called *Topological Evolution Rate (TopER)*, which simplifies a key concept of topological data analysis known as *filtration*. TopER calculates the evolution rate of graph substructures induced by a filtration function on nodes or edges, resulting in interpretable 2D visualizations of graph datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that this new embedding method achieves highly competitive performance compared to the latest deep learning models in graph classification tasks on benchmark datasets. We further provide theoretical stability guarantees for TopER.",

                "value": "This paper presents TopER, an innovative method for graph embedding based on topological data analysis (TDA). TopER introduces an efficient approach to graph representation learning by simplifying Persistent Homology, particularly in creating embeddings that capture the evolution of graph substructures. Instead of traditional graph neural network (GNN)-based methods, TopER focuses on generating interpretable, low-dimensional embeddings through filtration and linear regression on subgraph evolution rates. It shows competitive performance in clustering and classification tasks across various datasets, such as molecular and social networks, underscoring its utility for interpretable, scalable graph embeddings."

By tracking the evolution rate of graph substructures, TopER provides a low-dimensional, interpretable graph representation, enabling it to capture graph structure effectively without high computational costs.\nss\nComputational Efficiency: The limitations in computational efficiency are crucial since they directly impact the scalability of TopER for large real-world applications, a primary goal of embedding methods. Improving this area could make TopER more viable for large-scale datasets in practice.\n\nGood Interpretability and Visualization: The two-dimensional embeddings produced by TopER offer strong interpretability, allowing users to easily identify clusters, outliers, and structural features within datasets. Unlike higher-dimensional embeddings, which are often challenging to interpret, TopER is well-suited for data exploration and graph visualization."

Since both threshold choice and n could impact results, further analysis would be valuable.\n\nClarity on Embedding Dimension: The paper lacks details on TopER\u2019s final embedding dimension and does not directly compare it to the embedding dimensions of other algorithms. Embedding dimension is crucial for evaluating performance and computational efficiency, so specifying and comparing the dimensions of different methods would enhance the clarity and interpretability of the results.\n\nDataset-Specific Dimension Variability: Line 394 mentions \"top-performing combinations of filtration and vectorization for each dataset,\" which suggests that embedding dimensions might vary across datasets. However, the paper does not clarify what these combinations are or discuss the impact of using different combinations across datasets, especially given the many possible configurations with the eight filtration functions.\n\nAblation Study Needs More Analysis: The ablation study does not analyze the effects of each filtration function on individual datasets, missing insights into how specific functions influence results across different types of data."

Through experiments, they show superior performance in graph classification, clustering, and interpretability.

The motivating figures also do not motivate a linear correlation, except for MUTAG.\n  - If there is a relation with persistence homology, then it should be discussed. \n- The method is limited to non-attributed graphs and cannot easily extend to attributed graphs, for which it might depend on other graph kernels to be devised.\n- High sensitivity to filtration functions: As can be noted by the ablation study, the performance is highly sensitive to the filtration functions used for a particular dataset. This limits the strengths since it is not clear if the set of filtration functions considered in this work are even exhaustive. \n- Training an MLP on top of (a, b) of different filtration functions also limits the interpretability since the discriminative features may be formed as a combination of different filtration trends. Furthermore, using a single filtration function is always less performative than using multiple functions, which means the evolution rate of no one function is capable of classifying the graphs accurately. \n- A simpler comparison should be provided that compares persistent homology and TopER in their time complexity and graph classification accuracy assuming the same filtration function. \n- Hyperparameter analysis of the number of thresholds is missing. \n- Empirical comparison with some important baselines is not provided:\n  - Immonen, Johanna, Amauri Souza, and Vikas Garg. \"Going beyond persistent homology using persistent homology.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).\n  - Hofer, Christoph, et al. \"Graph filtration learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
