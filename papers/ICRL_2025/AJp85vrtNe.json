    "title": "Statistical Test for Anomaly Detections using Variational Auto-Encoders by Selective Inference",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) have become a widely used tool for anomaly detection (AD), with research advancing from algorithm development to real-world applications. However, a critical challenge remains --- the lack of a reliable method to rigorously assess the reliability of detected anomalies, which restricts its use in high-stakes decision-making tasks such as medical diagnostics. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the VAE-AD Test, a novel approach for quantifying the statistical reliability of VAE-based AD. The key advantage of the VAE-AD Test lies in its ability to properly control the probability of misidentifying anomalies under a pre-specified level of guarantee $\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Specifically, by carefully analyzing the AD process of VAE, which operates through piecewise-linear functions, and leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework to assign valid p-values to the detected anomalies, we prove that theoretical control of the false detection rate is achievable. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets robustly support our theoretical results, showcasing the VAE-AD Test\u2019s superior performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work capable of conducting valid statistical inference to assess the reliability of VAE-based AD.",

Some symbols seem meaningless, for example, in Sec. 3, the authors split the input image into a signal space and a noise space. However, according to the analysis afterwards, I feel that it has nothing to do with the following descriptions.\n\nTo sum up, the weaknesses of 1 and 2 make the soundness and readability poor.\n\n3. It is not clear that the VAE need to be trained from scratch or fine tuned from some pre-trained visual models.\n4.

                "value": "\u2022  Defining Anomalous Regions: The method defines an anomalous region as the set of pixels with reconstruction errors exceeding a user-defined threshold. This reliance on a threshold could reduce the method's usability in practice, as users may not know the appropriate threshold value. Typically, anomaly detection methods focus first on detecting or identifying anomalous regions (i.e., selecting \u03bb, while a secondary goal is evaluating whether there is sufficient evidence to confirm those regions as true positives.\n\n\u2022  Region Constraints: The authors\u2019 approach allows for detection of any subset of pixels (i.e., it considers all elements in the power set). Many region-based anomaly detection methods impose constraints to ensure detected anomalies are meaningful. For instance, in the case of brain tumor images, there is no restriction to prevent the selection of a scattered set of pixels that do not form a contiguous region, which may occur with a large enough \u03bb . Conversely, a small \u03bb could lead to selecting all pixels except for a few, producing results that are challenging to interpret. This underlines the importance of selecting \u03bb judiciously to achieve meaningful region detection as a preliminary step.\n\n\u2022  Statistical Test Design: The authors\u2019 null hypothesis H0 posits that the average reconstruction error inside the anomalous region is the same as outside. However, their test statistic actually tests whether the average reconstruction error within the region differs from a theoretical expectation under their parametric model (\\eta^T*X, equation 7). This subtle difference implies that even if the in-region and out-region errors are not significantly different, the test could reject H0 if the parametric model's expected reconstruction error deviates from the observed value. Similarly, it could fail to reject H0 even when in-region and out-region errors differ, if these deviations do not align with the model\u2019s theoretical expectations.\n\n\u2022  Section 4 Readability: Section 4, which appears to be the critical contribution, is dense and challenging to follow. The writing assumes familiarity with advanced concepts, placing a high cognitive load on readers who wish to fully understand the authors' approach. A clearer breakdown of the key steps, possibly with illustrative examples, could make this section more accessible and persuasive.\n\n\u2022  Related Work: This work has a similar objective to the literature on scan statistics, which aims to detect and test for \u201canomalous\u201d regions. For example [1,2] tests for difference in vs out the region (which is the authors' original hypothesis setup), [3] extends this to observed vs expected (which is more consistent with the authors\u2019 test statistic) and focuses efficiently finding the most anomalous subset of data points (which would equate to selecting the correct value of lambda). [4] Seems to extend some of the ideas of [3] to medical images as well. And if we alternatively consider the image to be an adjacency graph of pixels you\u2019d have  [5,6,7]. To be clear, none of these use VAE, but  I also think for the authors VAE just represents a vehicle to measure deviations, upon which they then impose parametric assumptions. To be clear, I think VAE is a good vehicle to capture deviation, but given the use of VAE is not new to this work, the key contribution is the detection/testing of the anomalies produced by a VAE, so I am comparing the authors chosen approach to the scan approaches that making the same parametric assumptions could be applied to the deviations of the VAE\n\n\u2022  Experimental Limitations: The experiments provide limited insights into the practical benefits and drawbacks of this approach. Since the authors make no theoretical claims about properties other than the validity of the selective p-value, and given that the motivation is high-stakes AD, the experiments are crucial. However, they currently offer minimal information. For instance, it\u2019s unclear how the threshold \u03bb=1.2 was selected, which could offer practical guidance. Additionally, exploring the effects of different \u03bb values on detection outcomes would provide valuable context: what happens when it is too small or too large. The graphs are somewhat difficult to interpret, lack confidence intervals, and, beyond Type I error and power, do not demonstrate the accuracy of detected regions compared to true anomaly regions.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] Kulldorff, M.

Since the objective function of VAE, ELBO, includes a KL divergence term in addition to the reconstruction error, the reconstruction quality may not be very good, as seen in Figure 1.\n2. Conversely, what is the reason for using reconstruction error? With the VAE, it is possible to calculate probability values using importance sampling. I believe probability values would be more appropriate as anomaly scores than reconstruction error. ELBO could also be used as an alternative to probability values.\n3. As in Eq. (3), Gaussian noise is being added to the original data. As mentioned at the beginning of Section 6, its covariance matrix is set in two different ways. It seems that the noise based on the identity matrix shows better results, but noise following the identity matrix would be large if the image is normalized, and small if it is not. How would the performance change if the variance were scaled by a constant, such as $\\beta I$?\n4. In Eqs. (5) and (7), the difference in the mean values of each pixel between the normal and anomaly regions is used as the test statistic. I don't fully understand the reason for adopting this test statistic, so could you explain it? It seems obvious that the pixel values would differ between the normal and anomaly regions."
