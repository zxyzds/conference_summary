    "title": "Evolving Multi-Scale Normalization for Time Series Forecasting under Distribution Shifts",
    "abstract": "Complex distribution shifts are the main obstacle to achieving accurate long-term time series forecasting. Several efforts have been conducted to capture the distribution characteristics and propose adaptive normalization techniques to alleviate the influence of distribution shifts. However, these methods neglect intricate distribution dynamics that are observed from various scales and the evolving functions of both distribution dynamics and normalized mapping relationships. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Evolving Multi-Scale Normalization (EvoMSN) framework to tackle the distribution shift problem. Flexible normalization and denormalization are proposed based on the multi-scale statistics prediction module and adaptive ensembling. An evolving optimization strategy is designed to update the forecasting model and statistics prediction module collaboratively to track the shifting distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of EvoMSN in improving the performance of five mainstream forecasting methods on benchmark datasets and also show its superiority compared to existing advanced normalization and online learning approaches.",

                "value": "1. The paper aims to tackle the complex distribution shifts problem, but the description of what constitutes these distribution shifts is somewhat vague. It would be beneficial to provide a more specific description of how the distributions change. For instance, among the distributions \\(P(X)\\), \\(P(Y)\\), \\(P(X|Y)\\), and \\(P(Y|X)\\), which ones are changing and which ones remain constant? A clearer delineation of these changes would enhance the understanding of the problem being addressed.\n\n2. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of why normalization and denormalization can effectively address distribution shifts in time series forecasting. Providing a theoretical or empirical justification for this approach would strengthen the paper's arguments and help readers understand the underlying mechanisms better.\n\n3. The paper states that the EvoMSN framework can be combined with existing time series forecasting methods to improve their performance. However, it does not quantify the increase in computational complexity during training and testing when incorporating the EvoMSN framework. Understanding the trade-off between performance improvement and computational cost is crucial for practical applications.\n\n4. Section 3.3 introduces an offline two-stage pretraining and online alternate updating method to solve the bi-level optimization problem. The paper does not adequately explain why this particular method was chosen and whether there are theoretical guarantees for the optimization results obtained using this approach. A more detailed discussion of the advantages and potential limitations of this method would be beneficial.\n\n5. The experimental results show that the EvoMSN framework does not consistently improve the performance of the models. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of why this inconsistency occurs. A thorough investigation of the conditions under which the framework performs well or poorly would help in understanding the robustness of the proposed method and guide future improvements."

Module update frequency: The parameters of multi-scale statistics prediction module are updated only once for each\nincoming new data which might lead to difficulties in extracting some fast-changing statistics, resulting in poor performance.\n\n2. Periodicity extraction: The global dominant periodicity is determined based on the training data. In the online setting, a\nrelatively small training data split ratio might cause inappropriate periodicity extraction and will affect the effectiveness of\nmulti-scale slice-based analysis.\n\nOffline forecasting limitations\n\n1. Module update scopes: In the offline pretraining stage, the multi-scale statistics prediction module is only updated on the\ntraining data. The distinct statistics evolving dynamic of training data and testing data may cause worse performance in the\nevaluation stage.\n\nModeling limitations\n\n1.

More comprehensive characteristics of distribution, such as minimum and maximum value, are\nsignificant but neglected in the proposed framework."

                "value": "Q1. The relevant experimental details are confusing. What does the statement 'According to the widely applied online setting, the forecasts will be made as each test data sample arrives, and the model will be updated by one epoch according to the online forecasting loss' mean? Do you update the model once for a test sample or once for a batch sample? Please further explain the specific settings of online learning in detail.\n\nQ2.  To validate the model's effectiveness across a broader spectrum, larger-scale datasets spanning longer time periods should be incorporated.  This will help ascertain the model's robustness and applicability in scenarios with more significant temporal variations.\n\nQ3. Could authors add more baselines in the experiment, such as PatchMixer, Crossgcn, iTransformer, TimeMixer, Koopa, and other models.\n\nQ4. The author's contribution is incremental. The author's online learning strategy mainly involves patch normalization and two-stage training strategies, which have already been discussed in SAN and [2]. The contributions of SAN and [2] were overlooked in the related work and methods section. Additionally, what are the differences between the evolutionary training strategy and [2]? In Table 14, I did not observe significant performance improvements of the proposed model compared to SAN. The idea of multi-scale modeling originates from TimeMixer. It is recommended that the author further discuss these works in detail to clearly demonstrate their contribution. Furthermore, I suggest rewriting the recommendation section to highlight the technical gaps in existing works more clearly to clarify the motivation.\n\nQ5. In Table 5, we can see that the primary performance of the proposed method comes from the Online-strategy based on BI-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION, as discussed in [1] and [2]. Additionally, why did the author not evaluate the performance variability of multi-scale modeling variables? What findings are observed when K is greater than 4? Why were only ablation experiments conducted on DLinear? As far as I know, DLinear is a small model with unstable training, where even a small difference in a epoch could lead to significant performance variations. Therefore, it is recommended to add more benchmarks for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nQ5. Time series datasets are typically offline, and the running time of various models does not exceed one day.  Could you elaborate on the practical applications and advantages of online time series learning? \n\nQ6. DLinear reported a performance of 0.081 in the Exchange but 0.131 in this paper, and the performance of other benchmarks also dropped significantly in this paper. What could be the reason for this? A significant decline in baseline performance also occurs in Table 13. Please explain potential reasons for the discrepancy in results.\n\nQ7. Can the author provide a comparison of other models in Table 11?\n\nQ8. The author's motivation for the paper is the non-stationarity of time series, and the contribution is to address this problem from an online learning perspective. However, by comparing Table 1 and Table 8, I find that online learning does not actually have any benefits, and the performance of most models has shown a huge decline. The potential reason is that a test sample will lead to overfitting after updating the model. We do not need this update, and the original model can perform very well (at least better than after online learning).\n\n\nQ9. Unfair comparison. As mentioned above, updating the model with data from one batch or one sample can lead to overfitting. The baseline model was updated twice, while the author's model was actually updated only once, resulting in a delayed decrease in model performance.\n\nRef:\n[1] Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective.\n[2] Stephen Gould, Basura Fernando, Anoop Cherian, Peter Anderson, Rodrigo Santa Cruz, and Edison Guo. 2016.
