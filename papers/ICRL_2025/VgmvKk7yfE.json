    "abstract": "We present first experimental results from the \\textit{Turing Game}, a modern implementation of the original imitation game as proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. The Turing Game is a gamified interaction between two human players and one AI chatbot powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). The game is designed to explore whether humans can distinguish between their peers and machines in chat-based conversations, with human players striving to identify fellow humans and machines striving to blend in as one of them. To this end, we implemented a comprehensive framework that connects human players over the Internet with chatbot implementations. We detail the experimental results after a public launch at the Ars Electronica Festival in September 2024. While the experiment is still ongoing, in this paper we present our initial findings from the hitherto gathered data.\nOur long term vision of the project is to deepen the understanding of human-AI interactions and eventually contribute to improving LLMs and language-based user interfaces.",

                "value": "This work describes the Turing Game, a modification of Turing's Imitation Game by setting up humans to take on a symmetrical role of conversing with one another in a three-way fashion to detect which one of the players is a machine, rather than the traditional setup of having one person take on the role of a  interrogator and another take on the role of a judge. This work also describes an elaborate setup for scoring and pairing players at similar skill levels."

Without knowing what the chatbots are and knowing their performance from previous adaptations of the Turing Test, the value of the Turing Game is unclear to me. For example, do we find that these bots are considered indistinguishable to humans in previous work while the Turing Game finds that they are clearly distinguishable, as demonstrated by the low win rate?\n- In general, the work lacks clarity and requires many improvement in terms of presentation. See questions/suggestions for further detail."

                "value": "- Incorrect citation format. Differs from  other papers that I've reviewed.\n- Figure 1 and lines 64-68 are not clear on what the redesign is and how this is a better setup than the original Imitation Game. It would help to elaborate on what the checks and crosses mean, along with the hammers and the arrows.\n- lines 69-71: How does this setup avoid the quicksand of the notion of thinking?\n- lines 72: Citation?\n- line 83: what are the criteria for qualification?\n- line 87: not everyone is familiar with the festival and would not be able to imagine how this game was installed at the festival for collecting the data analyzed in this work.\n- line 115: incomplete sentence due to typo, likely missing \"asks\" between \"system\" and \"one.\"\n- What was the shortcoming of the work described in line 122-126? Did they exhibit the issues of results being noisy due to variance in participants' effort and gullibility?\n- The mention of the Chinese Room argument in line 147 is abrupt. What role does this serve in the narrative of the shortcoming of previous work?\n- line 174-175: Is there any evidence that time constraints were encouraging System 1 judgements over System 2 reasoning? Also, is there evidence that System 2 reasoning is better than System 1 judgement for discerning between LLM and humans? Otherwise, this would be an unsubstantiated claim.\n- What is the reverse effect of the Turing Test mentioned in line 191-192?\n- line 199-207: doesn't this cause a downward spiral for initially underperforming players as they continue to get paired with underperforming players as they keep losing points due to the other players' mistakes? Shouldn't each player be scored based on their own prediction only? This may disincentivize collaborative interactions for gaining points but if the goal is to find the most proficient ones, this may be the better design.\n- Is the formulation in line 216-221 correct in that the sigmoid is setup so that a bigger weight is assigned for games that were played earlier and lower weight is assigned for later games? (as k approaches 100, it gets closer to 0.5 while starting from closer to 1 when k=0) This seems counterintuitive since line 215 mentions measuring current strength, so shouldn't more recent games be weighted more?\n- line 226: Why is a strong prior towards $S_i=1$ needed?\n- line 285-286: typo? likely \"the snips were taken once the game finished...\"\n- line 284, line 340-342: What are AllTalker, MadTalker, and MetaSim?\n- What is the dialogue manager of the chatbots? Based on Figure 4, it is unclear how the bot decides to produce a turn given a three-way conversation. For instance, on the right side of Figure 4, Purple waits for others' responses but none is given by the bot, while in certain turns it produces two utterances at a time.\n- line 336-337: I think examining the nature of games surrendered is going to be important, especially since it takes up a significant portion of games that were played.\n- Section 4.3: This setup is akin to detecting LLMs, and therefore I would like to see how this result compares to DetectGPT, etc.\n- Table 1: How is equation 8 applied to compute the weighted win ratio?"

Why derive your own ranking metric for this game when other ELO generalizations exist? See TrueSkill [0]. I think it satisfies many of your constraints.

Also \u201cnominator\u201d -> numerator.\n\nWhy not just use an already-validated player ranking metric like TrueSkill?\n\nFinally, did authors take consent from participants or pay participants? Was the user study approved by some kind of IRB?\n\n**Framing Questions:**\n\nI think the authors have a goldmine of a dataset in their possession. Unfortunately, the current paper\u2019s framing focuses a bit too much on the system's infrastructure rather than the game's dynamics! The dynamics here are the interesting part: how do humans build common ground with each other in unsuccessful games? What about successful games? What cues do people rely on to single out an AI model? If longer interactions are indeed more successful, can we forecast early if a conversation will go long? Are early interactions likely to predict if users will successfully identify the AI? \n\nMore generally, I wanted to see a deeper analysis of the dynamics of how human successfully came to discern that the system was or wasn\u2019t an AI. Also: why not reframe the paper and focus on this being a dataset contribution? That would be cool too. Are the authors planning on releasing all the interaction data?"
