    "title": "EventFlow: Forecasting Continuous-Time Event Data with Flow Matching",
    "abstract": "Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, which is typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion by a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance is unsatisfactory in forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors. We propose $\\texttt{EventFlow}$, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. Our model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn the joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. $\\texttt{EventFlow}$ is easy to implement and sample from, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks on a set of standard benchmarks.",

                "value": "The work proposes a generative approach of modelling (unmarked) temporal point process based on diffusion models. The work decompose the distributions of temporal pointe process into the joint distribution of the number of events in a TPP realization and the joint distribution of event time conditioned on the number of events via a diffusion model in the rectified flow fashion. The proposed approach can be conditioned on history information for generate future events. Evaluation results on both unconditional generation results on commonly used TPP datasets and conditional future events forecasting shows superior performance of the model over baselines."

This motivation positions the work as a novel approach toward the challenging task of future events forecasting in a fixed time horizon instead of single next event prediction. Experiment results also show clear advantages of the proposed work in multi-events forecasting in a fixed time window over existing works.\n* The decomposition of TPP distribution into the distribution of the number of events and the joint distributions of event times is also a novel approach toward TPP modelling."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The work has the following weakness:\n* The presentation of the work has room of improvements:\n    * It is not clear what\u2019s the purpose of introducing balanced coupling of TPPs in Section 4.1. The interpolation between two event sequences can be well defined without introducing balanced coupling and the number of events is modelled separately. In other words, the presentations of the methods does not necessarily rely on the introduction of balanced coupling and the theoretical results of the iff condition for the balanced coupling set to be non-empty. It would be helpful to add some intuitive motivation for this section in the work.\n    * In the current presentation of approach, the original contribution (Section 4.1, 4.2, separate modelling of event count and event time) and existing work (Sections 4.3, 4.4, mostly rectified flows[1]) are intertwined in one section. I would suggest the authors to consider either clearly separating their original contributions from the methods in existing works or more clearly stating their contributions in terms of methodology instead of using generic statements of contributions like a generative model for TPP.\n* The work constrains the type of TPP it models to unmarked temporal point process without event category labels. The practical values of the work is limited. \n* It is arguable that MSE/RMSE for next event prediction is one of the most important evaluation results for TPP models due to its wide existence in many existing TPP works [2, 3, 4], practical applicability, and easiness to compare between models. As the work is capable of conditional generation, not including this evaluation task results is disappointing.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Liu, Xingchao, Chengyue Gong, and Qiang Liu. \"Flow straight and fast: Learning to generate and transfer data with rectified flow.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.03003 (2022).\n\n[2] Yang, Chenghao, Hongyuan Mei, and Jason Eisner. \"Transformer embeddings of irregularly spaced events and their participants.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.00044 (2021).\n\n[3] Shchur, Oleksandr, Marin Bilo\u0161, and Stephan G\u00fcnnemann. \"Intensity-free learning of temporal point processes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.12127 (2019).\n\n[4] Xue, Siqiao, et al. \"Easytpp: Towards open benchmarking the temporal point processes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.08097 (2023)."

                "value": "1. Do the models for conditional and unconditional generation share parameters?\n2. The EventFlow model does not guarantee the generated sequences of event times preserves the original order of $\\gamma_0$ but simply relies on learning such prior from training data. Does the work anpply any post-processing to generated results to deal with this potential problem? If not, do the authors encounter situations where the generated event sequence times are not in an increasing order?\n3. The author claims the approach is likelihood-free. Is the re-ordering of sampled $\\gamma_0$ part of the reasons that make the model incapable of evaluating likelihood of event sequences? Is it possible to define the distribution which $\\gamma_0$ is sampled from in a fashion such that the $t_s$ are naturally in an ascending order?\n4. Can the approach be extended to model marked TPP with event category labels in trivial ways like using the the hidden states of the denoising neural networks $\\v_\\theta$ to predict event categories?"

The proposed method eventflow including interpolant construction and training, and sampling seems very solid (although I did check the full details.) The paper also examines the two important cases conditional forecasting and unconditional with respect to history and conducts experiments which demonstrate the effectiveness. \n\nClarity: it is well presented for the most part. \n\nSignificance: I think this is an interest line of research as it deviates from traditional autoregressive models for TPP and I believe it is worthy of investigation by our community."

The learned p\u03c6(n | H) is then used to sample a count n for a specific instance for further inference task. For the experiments, while the authors use MMD as a metric for sequence distance, I don\u2019t know how the forecasted number of events compared with the ground truth. Similarly I am not entirely sure how the forecasting times compared with the ground truth. Some visual aids will be very helpful."

As EventFlow is based on a CNF, evaluating the likelihoods of single sequences should be possible. Including an NLL-based comparison, as done in other works (Shchur et al., 2019), would strengthen the evaluation.\n- Certain hyperparameters are missing. How many neural function evaluations are used to solve the ODE? An ablation would help compare the performance with previous diffusion-based approaches.\n- A runtime comparison with AddAndThin needs to be included.
