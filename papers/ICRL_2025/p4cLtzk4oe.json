    "title": "Exploring Local Memorization in Diffusion Models via Bright Ending Attention",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we identify and leverage a novel `bright ending' (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images to address a new task: locating localized memorization regions within these models. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image generations using diffusion models. Specifically, memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the end token during the final inference step compared to non-memorized patches. This attention map effectively highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data. Furthermore, driven by our observation that local memorization significantly underperforms in existing tasks of measuring, detecting, and mitigating memorization in diffusion models compared to global memorization, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE and the results of the new localization task into these existing frameworks. This integration effectively improves their performances by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only demonstrate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon.",

                "value": "This paper is a followup work of Wen et al. (2024), which discovered interesting patterns that \"abnormally high predicted noise magnitude\" indicate \"global memorization\". This work finds similar patterns between \"abnormally high cross-attention values\" of the EOS token in the prompt with the image tokens indicate \"local memorization\". The experiments validate such patterns can indeed be used to find local memorization."

                "value": "1. In multiple places, the authors state that the \"bright ending\" is obvious at the final denoising step. However, in the experimental results presented in Table 1, the 3 designs were using \"First Step\", \"First 10 Steps\", and \"All Steps\", respectively. Only \"All steps\" include \"the final denoising step\", but apparently \"the final denoising step\" plays only a minor role in \"All steps\". Why this discrepancy?\n2. In section 5.1, \"we propose element-wise multiplication of the magnitude by our memorization mask extracted via BE\". However, the authors didn't give details about how to extract a memorization mask from BE in Section 4. Is this done using a fixed threshold? a dynamic threshold? Or a threshold predicted by a dedicated NN?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. AFAIK there's no dedicated EOS token used by stable diffusion. Instead, there are only 77-N padding tokens which are almost identical to each other (except for being added with different positional encodings). Suppose the prompt contains 15 tokens, then there will be 77-15=62 padding tokens which have identical token embeddings. I believe the cross-attention maps of these tokens are highly similar to each other. Do you compute the cross-attention map by averaging these 77-N attention maps? Or do you choose the last padding token to extract the cross-attention map?"

This insight enables the extraction of localized memorization regions without access to training data. The paper proposes a new task\u2014locating these localized memorization regions\u2014and integrates this approach with existing evaluation, detection, and mitigation strategies. The paper demonstrate that incorporating BE significantly improves performance in existing tasks, particularly in narrowing the gap caused by local memorization, achieving state-of-the-art results."

The paper clearly differentiates between global and local memorization, offering detailed explanations of how BE is used for local region detection. Figures and visualizations of attention maps provide clarity on how the BE mechanism operates in practice, enhancing understanding of the proposed method.\n\nThe motivation of the paper is sound.

Can it be applied to video generation?\n\nGiven the increased inference time due to analysis at the final denoising step, do the authors have suggestions for optimizing the process to make it more efficient for real-time applications?"
