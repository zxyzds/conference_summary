    "abstract": "Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce VoxCap, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: de-novo design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse de-novo hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.",

                "value": "Conceptual Framework and Definitions:\nA concern lies in the manuscript's handling of core concepts. The authors' definition of a pharmacophore requires significant refinement. A pharmacophore isn't simply a \"feature of a molecule\" but rather a collection of essential features arranged in a specific 3D pattern. The current definition using \"may be involved in binding\" is too tentative - pharmacophore features are understood to be essential for binding. Furthermore, the statement that \"Drug discovery campaigns typically rely on pharmacophore-shape based design\" needs qualification, as many campaigns employ different approaches or pharmacophore representations beyond shape-based models. The manuscript needs to clearly distinguish between pharmacophore models and shape-based approaches, particularly when discussing their respective limitations.\n\nSeveral technical aspects require clarification: \n- The methodology for generating pharmacophore features isn't fully explained. The handling of heavy atoms versus hydrogens and pH/protonation states, which affect hydrogen bond donor/acceptor characteristics, needs elaboration. The manuscript would benefit from including distributions of pharmacophore features across the datasets in the supplementary information.\n- Questions arise about feature assignment - particularly how aromatic and hydrophobic features spanning multiple atoms were handled. Was a Gaussian applied over a centroid within ring systems, or were features calculated individually for each atom? The consistent radius of 1 (presumably Angstrom) needs clarification, as does the handling of multiple pharmacophore features per atom.\n- The treatment of SMILES representation isn't addressed. Whether canonical SMILES were used isn't specified, which is crucial given that molecules can have multiple valid SMILES representations. This choice could significantly impact training consistency.\n\nA critical issue is the lack of code availability, which hampers reproducibility - a cornerstone of scientific research. The code should be considered an extension of the experimental setup, and its absence makes proper evaluation challenging.\n\nThe training methodology raises several concerns:\n- The training objective focuses solely on SMILES string reconstruction without explicit optimization for pharmacophoric feature matching\nThere's potential redundancy in encoding pharmacophoric features when molecular shape often implies chemical group locations\nThe added computational complexity of incorporating pharmacophoric information may not justify the benefits\nTo validate the model's learning, I recommend testing three variants:\n- The current implementation\n- A version without pharmacophore features (shape-based only)\n- A version with only pharmacophore features\n\nPerformance Claims and Evaluation:\nThe authors' claim of outperforming existing state-of-the-art \"by large margins across all metrics\" isn't fully supported by the data. The supplementary materials show high standard deviations, and no significance tests were performed. The \"fast-search\" approach, while novel, shows concerning underperformance in hit retrieval rates - a crucial metric in virtual screening.\n\nPractical Applicability\nThe fast search workflow's practical utility is questionable. While generating similar compounds based on an \"active\" molecule is feasible, the current approach risks missing potential hits through its ECFP-based filtering. In drug development, where missing valuable analogues could cost months or years of development time, such limitations are significant. While computational efficiency is important, it shouldn't compromise thoroughness to this extent."

                "value": "Major:\n\n1. Experimental results could be strengthened:\n  - De novo design\n    - PGMG is a relevant baseline, however data processing differs between VoxCap and PGMG making it difficult to interpret which part of the workflow contributes to difference in performance. The authors could investigate a hybrid approach method which matches the conformer generation and voxelization approach. Or in general provide an ablation study that shows why VoxCap is better than other methods.\n    - Comparison with other generative chemistry approaches such as REINVENT with a ROCS scoring function is necessary to interpret the fidelity of VoxCap.\n    - In addition to the current dataset baseline, the authors could compare with the full database search (as in the virtual screening approach below), since this would demonstrate the shortcomings of virtual screening as mentioned in the introduction.\n\n  - Fast search\n    - The authors use VoxCap as a method for virtual screening but do not evaluate it using standard virtual screening benchmarks such as https://github.com/rdkit/benchmarking_platform.\n    - To my understanding, the Brute force method serves as a source of truth in this experiment (an upper bound on performance), and therefore this experiment has no baselines. For example the authors mention morgan fingerprints, this could be added to Table 3 as a baseline.\n    - Given the critiques surrounding the speed of ROCS, it would be sensible to include faster 3D shape comparison methods as baselines such as USRCAT and pharmit (or any other).\n\n2. Claims surrounding performance\n  - One of the main claims of the authors is that forward passes through a neural network are cheap compared with ROCS. This claim should be substantiated with numerical measures of performance. e.g. How long would it take to fast-search the molport or enamine REAL library.\n\nMinor:\n- The introduction focusses on the shortcomings of virtual screening in terms of molecule novelty, however as the authors point out (line 63) this has significant practical advantages and as such generative tools are not usually considered for this task as a matter of choice. The authors could reposition their argument such that both de novo design and virtual screening are both shown as useful parts of the drug discovery process.\n- The authors definition of pharmacophore is inaccurate, there is a true pharmacophore (that may not be 3D and refers to the minimal features necessary for molecular recognition), and a computational pharmacophore model (features that have the potential for interacting, for which many models exist: CREDO, UFF, OpenEye, etc). This should be clarified.\n- The authors should include rates of duplication and invalid SMILES removed before analysis.\n- Some more insight into the properties of molecules generated by VoxCap would be appreciated, length distributions, molecule features, etc.\n- Standard deviations in Table S1 should be included in table 1 and 2 since they are discussed in the main text.\n- Consideration of prior work should be extended:\n  - The authors focus on virtual screening, but VoxCap resembles a generative method and as such the paper would be improved by a discussion of generative modelling in chemistry, including common methods such as REINVENT (see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644621002531).\n  - Amongst 3D generative models, discussion of molecular representation would be valuable since voxel based models have known advantages and disadvantages over e.g. graph-based 3D models (see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X23000404).\n  - The paper would also benefit from a discussion of how VoxCap differs from prior 3D ligand based pharmacophore models such as those presented in PGMG, Ragoza et al. and Pinheiro et al..\n  - The speed of ROCS is a well known limitation of that tool, hence the development of many fast cheminformatic solutions such as FastROCS (GPU-accelerated ROCS), USRCAT (and other shape-based fingerprinting techniques) and pharmit (pharmer, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci200097m).

The authors evaluate VoxCap in shape/pharmacophore-conditioned de novo molecular design tasks, principally evaluating against PGMG, which is a recent model that generates molecules conditioned on a graph-based representation of a reference set of pharmacophores. The authors show that VoxCap outperforms PGMG at generating molecules that are more similar to a reference ligand with respect to their shapes and pharmacophores, according to the external 3D scoring function ROCS. Conformers are enumerated for the generated SMILES prior to ROCS evaluation.\n\nVoxCap also introduces a strategy of quickly searching an enumerated virtual chemical library for hits that are similar with regards to their shapes and pharmacophores compared to a reference molecule. Specifically, the authors first generate analogs of the reference molecule with VoxCap, and then use fast 2D chemical fingerprint similarities to search the virtual library for compounds that are graphically similar to the generated molecules. This strategy returns fewer hits with adequate ROCS scores compared to a ROCS-based virtual screen of the virtual library, but requires fewer ROCS evaluations."

VoxCap appears to be a basic (re)implementation of previous published work on pharmacophore-conditioned SMILES-based generative models, without substantial modifications that are new or meaningful to the ICLR community. In particular, VoxCap looks quite similar (at least at a high-level) to LigDream (*Skalic et al., Shape-Based Generative Modeling for de Novo Drug Design, JCIM, 2019*), which used RNNs to caption voxel representations of shapes/pharmacophores. Note that LigDream was introduced 5 years ago. The authors should explicitly indicate how their proposed model meaningfully differs from existing work, and how VoxCap\u2019s technical machine learning contributions contribute to its empirical or theoretical performance.\n\n2. Evaluating PGMG with ROCS\u2019 combined shape+color Tanimoto score is somewhat unfair, as PGMG does not explicitly condition on molecular shape (PGMG only considers pharmacophores, which only implicitly define the molecular shape via their spatial arrangement). It would be more appropriate for the authors to compare against other *existing* voxel-conditioned molecular generation approaches that *do* condition on both shape and pharmacophores (see further comments below).\u2028\n\n3. Before the authors can claim SOTA in pharmacophore/shape-conditioned molecular generation, they need to compare against papers beyond PGMG, especially considering the rich literature on SMILES-based generative models that are explicitly designed to maximize pharmacophore and shape similarity. Many of these previous works are cited by the authors in their Related Work sections, but are not included as comparisons despite their high methodological relevancy. The original work in this area is LigDream (*Skalic et al., Shape-Based Generative Modeling for de Novo Drug Design, JCIM, 2019*), whose model design is quite analogous to VoxCap. I also highly recommend that the authors compare against *Papadopoulos et al., De novo design with deep generative models based on 3d similarity scoring, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 44, 2021*, which uses REINVENT to generate molecules that directly optimize the combined ROCS color+shape score. REINVENT is widely used for general molecular optimization, and is often employed for pharmacophore and/or shape-conditioned molecular design tasks.\u2028\n\n4. The author\u2019s *fast search* approach --  which virtually screens an enumerated library for hits that are similar to a reference ligand in terms of their pharmacophores --  is not very well-motivated and empirically does not perform well.  The authors first generate *de novo* analogues of the reference ligand that are supposed to have high 3D pharmacophore similarity (but ideally low 2D chemical similarity) compared to the reference ligand, but then use (fast) 2D chemical similarity-based lookups to search the virtual library for molecules that are similar to the generated molecules. However, the entire point 3D pharmacophore-based virtual screening is to find hits that have disinct 2D chemical structures but similar 3D pharmacophores compared to a reference molecule, as 3D pharmacophore similarity and 2D chemical similarity may not be well correlated. The hits from VoxCap's virtual screen (which are identified via 2D chemical similarity to generated molecules) are not guaranteed to have high pharmacophore similarity to the original reference molecule, especially if the hits' chemical fingerprint similarities w.r.t. the *de novo* generated queries are low. Indeed, the authors report in Line 403 that these observed chemical similarities are relatively low. Hence, the proposed *fast search* approach is not likely to find many compounds that have high *3D pharmacophore similarity* compared to the original reference ligand. Indeed, this outcome is what the authors observe. Given 500 (generated) queries, only 10 hits (out of 450 total possible hits) were identified via 2D-nearest-neighbor-lookup that showed adequate 3D similarity to the reference ligand. It would be more principled to use a 3D pharmacophore/shape fingerprint and screen the virtual library based on *alignment-free* pharmacophore fingerprint similarity. This is indeed *many* previous works do to avoid the costs of alignment-based pharmacophore similarity searching -- these works are notably not cited by the authors; see below comment.\n\n5. The authors ignore many previous works that have developed fast methods for pharmacophore-based virtual screening. A non-exhaustive selection of relevant works that develop pharmacophore fingerprints for this task include:\n    - Pharmacoprint - https://github.com/lstruski/Pharmacoprint\n    - PMapper - https://github.com/DrrDom/pmapper \n    - Psearch -  https://github.com/meddwl/psearch\n    - Pharmer - https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci200097m\n    - RDKit\u2019s native functionality: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#d-pharmacophore-fingerprints\n\n6. The authors do not adequately evaluate the diversity of generated molecules, particularly the 2D chemical similarity of the generated molecules with respect to the original reference ligand. Although the authors do discard molecules that are exactly the same as the reference ligand in their evaluations, it is important to compare their Morgan chemical fingerprint similarities, as well, to ensure that the \u201chits\u201d that are generated aren\u2019t just slightly altered versions of the original molecule. Indeed, the maximum ROCS scores that the authors report from VoxCap are as high as 1.77, which in my experience only occurs when the two molecules under comparison are very similar in chemical graph space. The authors\u2019 \u201cunique scaffold hit\u201d metric is inadequate for evaluating meaningful molecular diversity/novelty, as \u201cunique\u201d scaffolds can still be quite similar in chemical graph space. Evaluating global chemical fingerprint similarity would be more appropriate. Additionally, the authors should report validity, novelty, uniqueness, and diversity metrics to support this analysis.\n\n7. No code or reproducibility statement is provided."
