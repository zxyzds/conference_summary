    "title": "Ctrl-Adapter: An Efficient and Versatile Framework for Adapting Diverse Controls to Any Diffusion Model",
    "abstract": "ControlNets are widely used for adding spatial control to text-to-image diffusion models. However, when it comes to controllable video generation, ControlNets cannot be directly integrated into new backbones due to feature space mismatches, and training ControlNets for new backbones can be a significant burden for many users. Furthermore, applying ControlNets independently to different frames can not effectively maintain object temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce Ctrl-Adapter, an efficient and versatile framework that adds diverse controls to any image/video diffusion models through the adaptation of pretrained ControlNets. Ctrl-Adapter offers strong and diverse capabilities, including image and video control, sparse-frame video control, fine-grained patch-level multi-condition control, zero-shot adaptation to unseen conditions, and supports a variety of downstream tasks beyond spatial control, including video editing, video style transfer, and text-guided motion control. With six diverse U-Net/DiT-based image/video diffusion models (SDXL, PixArt-\u03b1, I2VGen-XL, SVD, Latte, Hotshot-XL), Ctrl-Adapter matches the performance of pretrained ControlNets on COCO and achieves the state-of-the-art on DAVIS 2017 with significantly lower computation (< 10 GPU hours). We provide video examples in https://ctrladapterexamples.github.io and code in the supplementary material.",

It could reveal conditions where skipping latents is beneficial versus scenarios where it may compromise quality.\n+ Whether skipping latents reduces the ability of the CTRL-Adapter to generalize between certain control types.\n+ In my experience, the most significant advantage of this work is the value of a wide range of applications.

                "value": "1. The comparison of training costs might not be entirely fair. Since the CTRL-Adapter leverages a pre-trained image ControlNet and then adapts it for video tasks, it benefits from the substantial pre-training cost in the image control task. Given that the image ControlNet is already proficient at extracting information from various conditions, this adaptation should inherently be faster. Therefore, when evaluating training efficiency, it is crucial to account for the advantages gained from the pre-trained ControlNet. \n\n2. The explanation of how multiple conditions are integrated in the proposed method could be clearer and more detailed. The paper briefly outlines three possible integration strategies in a single paragraph, accompanied by a figure, which might be insufficient for comprehending the intricacies involved. This section deserves more space and elaboration in the main text rather than being relegated to the appendix."

                "value": "1. What is the additional inference cost associated with using multiple condition ControlNets along with their corresponding control adapters, for example, when handling seven different conditions in Table 3? While the paper mentions significant reductions in training costs by focusing on adapting image-based ControlNets for video tasks, how does the increase in inference complexity, due to maintaining multiple controls, impact overall efficiency and performance? \n\n2. Would integrating control adapters directly inside each ControlNet simplify the adaptation process and make it more efficient, like a fine-tuning task from image to video ControlNet? Could this approach be a viable and efficient baseline, particularly for single-condition scenarios?"
