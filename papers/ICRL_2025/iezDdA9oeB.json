    "title": "Fast and Accurate Blind Flexible Docking",
    "abstract": "Molecular docking that predicts the bound structures of small molecules (ligands) to their protein targets, plays a vital role in drug discovery. However, existing docking methods often face limitations: they either overlook crucial structural changes by assuming protein rigidity or suffer from low computational efficiency due to their reliance on generative models for structure sampling. To address these challenges, we propose FABFlex, a fast and accurate regression-based multi-task learning model designed for realistic blind flexible docking scenarios, where proteins exhibit flexibility and binding pocket sites are unknown (blind). Specifically, FABFlex's architecture comprises three specialized modules working in concert: (1) A pocket prediction module that identifies potential binding sites, addressing the challenges inherent in blind docking scenarios. (2) A ligand docking module that predicts the bound (holo) structures of ligands from their unbound (apo) states. (3) A pocket docking module that forecasts the holo structures of protein pockets from their apo conformations. Notably, FABFlex incorporates an iterative update mechanism that serves as a conduit between the ligand and pocket docking modules, enabling continuous structural refinements. This approach effectively integrates the three subtasks of blind flexible docking\u2014pocket identification, ligand conformation prediction, and protein flexibility modeling\u2014into a unified, coherent framework. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that FABFlex not only achieves superior effectiveness in predicting accurate binding modes but also exhibits a significant speed advantage (208$\\times$) compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at~\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FABFlex-51FC}.",

                "value": "This paper addresses the challenging and realistic scenario of blind flexible molecular docking, where the binding sites are unknown and the proteins exhibit dynamic behavior during the docking process. This is a critical problem that reflects how molecules interact with proteins. The paper argues that current flexible docking methods, predominantly reliant on sampling strategies with diffusion models, suffer from significant inefficiencies. To overcome this drawback, the paper explores the potential of regression-based model in handling flexible docking. Utilizing AlphaFold2-predicted apo protein conformations, this paper proposes an end-to-end regression-based model named FABFlex, designed to achieve both fast computation and accurate docking performance in blind flexible docking scenarios. Experiments show that FABFlex not only significantly enhances the ligand structures and positively performs impacts on pocket conformations, but also substantially accelerates docking speed compared to the recent SOTA method, DynamicBind."

                "value": "- The paper presents all details clearly and comprehensibly.\n- This is the one of first applications of regression-based flexible blind docking.\n- It employs an interesting multi-task approach, addressing more than a single task simultaneously.\n- The use of flexibility, rather than just rigidity, in docking, combined with a regression approach, makes the paper compelling.\n- The pipeline provides a systematic, data-driven approach to molecular docking.\n- The experiments are detailed and clearly presented, with comprehensive benchmarking against other models.\n- The code is openly shared (though the README is empty; see weaknesses).\n\n**Originality:** FABFlex is innovative as a regression-based model for flexible docking. It also stands out for its multi-task capability, predicting not only apo structures but also holo-structures.\n\n**Quality:** The paper's quality is highlighted by its comprehensive benchmarking against other models. Additionally, it goes beyond ligand RMSD to include pocket RMSD analyses, further enhancing the study\u2019s depth.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is well-written grammatically, with equations that are scientifically clear, readable, and easy to follow."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- This study closely resembles the FABind[1,2] approach in both training and inference, with many of the techniques used already present in FABind. Consequently, flexible docking appears somewhat overshadowed by FABind.\n- It is not specified whether protein preprocessing is used for inference runtime, affecting the runtime comparison.\n- Using binary classification to identify pocket regions could limit flexibility at the atomic level; a more adaptable approach may be beneficial.\n- The study relies solely on the RMSD metric, which does not always ensure plausible structures. Metrics such as semi-empirical binding affinity, protein-ligand steric clashes, and ligand strain energy, as suggested by [3,4,5,6,7], should be considered.\n- Although proteins and ligands are visually classified as apo or holo, this classification does not guarantee bioactive, chemical, or physical plausibility. Including metrics like binding affinity, steric clashes, and ligand strain energy would provide greater insight, as demonstrated in studies like Posebuster[3], PoseCheck[4], PoseBench[5], CompassDock[6], and PLINDER[7].\n- The binding affinity, protein-ligand steric clashes, and ligand strain energy for the processed PDBBind\u2019s apo and holo structures were not examined.\n- While RMSD may increase due to holo pocket region flexibility, the focus should instead be on binding affinity, steric clashes, and ligand strain energy, but the study only emphasizes RMSD.\n- It is unclear if other DL-based models in the benchmark used the same timesplit or were retrained for comparability.\n- If RMSD is the chosen metric, timesplit information leakage may occur, as described in the PLINDER study. Clarifying timesplitting methods would strengthen the study.\n- As a FABind user, I found the reported runtime of 0.12 sec inaccurate. When protein preprocessing is included, runtime is closer to 10-15 seconds, with 0.12 sec applying only to ligand conformation prediction. Based on FABind, I expect FABFlex\u2019s runtime to exceed the stated 0.49 sec with protein preprocessing included.\n- Although FABFlex claims faster runtime than DiffDock, normalizing per-ligand runtime suggests DiffDock may be more efficient, as DiffDock samples ~40 ligand conformations in ~2 sec per conformation, while FABFlex takes ~10-15 sec for one prediction.\n\n**Quality:** The RMSD metric may lack biological, chemical, or physical relevance. For benchmarking, it would be better to include up-to-date metrics like semi-empirical binding affinity, protein-ligand steric clashes, and ligand strain energy.\n\n**Clarity:** The criteria for selecting the values of alphas in the loss function are not clearly explained.\n\n**Reproducibility:** Although the code is open source, the README section is empty, and usage instructions are not provided. If the README were clarified, I could test and reassess the code\u2019s reproducibility. Additionally, the conda environment in the YAML file is named \"FABind,\" raising anonymity concerns regarding double-blind review, as it suggests potential overlap with FABind\u2019s authors.\n\n**Minor Mistake**\n\n\"Subsequent\" is used twice:\n> \"The predicted pocket sites by pocket prediction module enable the subsequent subsequent ligand\"\n\n### **References**\n[1] Qizhi Pei, Kaiyuan Gao, Lijun Wu, Jinhua Zhu, Yingce Xia, Shufang Xie, Tao Qin, Kun He, Tie-Yan Liu, Rui Yan.
