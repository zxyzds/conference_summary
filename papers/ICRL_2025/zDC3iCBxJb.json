    "abstract": "Molecular docking is a key task in computational biology that has attracted increasing interest from the machine learning community. While existing methods have achieved success, they generally treat each protein-ligand pair in isolation. Inspired by the biochemical observation that ligands binding to the same target protein tend to adopt similar poses, we propose \\textsc{GroupBind}, a novel molecular docking framework that simultaneously considers multiple ligands docking to a protein. This is achieved by introducing an interaction layer for the group of ligands and a triangle attention module for embedding protein-ligand and group-ligand pairs. By integrating our approach with diffusion based docking model, we set a new state-of-the-art performance on the PDBBind blind docking benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of our paradigm in enhancing molecular docking accuracy.",

                "value": "1. The core idea is similar  to MCS (Maximum Common Substructure) docking [1, 2], which assume that ligands with similar substructures exhibit similar docking poses. GroupBind, however, assumes all ligands share similar docking poses. Figure 1 depicts highly similar ligands with similar docking structures. Conversely, [3] (Figure 4) illustrates cases where structurally distinct ligands adopt distinct poses. A statistical comparison quantifying the difference between the MCS docking assumption and GroupBind's assumption is warranted.\n\n2. Comparing GroupBind-Ref against blind docking methods like DiffDock is unfair. DiffDock performs blind docking, whereas GroupBind-Ref utilizes prior knowledge of the binding pocket, making it a site-specific docking method. This introduces a significant advantage for GroupBind-Ref.\n\n3. The evaluation should include more baselines such as FABind [5] and FABind+ [6], for which source code is available. Expanding the evaluation to include datasets like PoseBuster would assess GroupBind's ability to predict physically plausible structures.\n\n4. The reported top-1 docking success rate for DiffDock (32.4% with 40 samples in Table 1) appears considerably lower than previously \nreported results (38.2% in [4] and 36.0% in [5]). This discrepancy requires clarification.\n\n5. The clarity of the writing could be improved.

This is not the first time the concept that multiple similar molecules can be used to enhance molecular docking has been described.  ComBind (Paggi et al, 2021; cited in the paper) does exactly that.  There are other methods that use this insight in different ways (e.g. selecting poses from ensemble docking).  The contributions should be qualified that this is the first end-to-end deep neural network approach to molecular docking that uses this insight.\n\nThe results only compare to single-ligand docking.  Comparing to ComBind (or OpenComBind if lacking a Schroedinger license) would be more relevant.  Can the diffusion model approach make better use of the similarity bias than previous methods? This question goes unanswered.\n\nNot going beyond the PDBbind to identify alternative augmentation ligands (of which there are many, as structures aren't needed for inference) is a missed opportunity that weakens the paper as with the current evaluation framework many ligands can't be put into groups.  Replicating the ComBind evaluation would provide predefined groups of ligands while also making it possible directly compare to a conventional approach.\n\nThere are issues with using a time split to assess generalizability, but as this is the same split used with DiffDock it is appropriate to use for the comparisons performed here.\n\nThe overloading of \"k\" to mean two different things in Fig 2 is confusing.\n\nI found equations (4) and (5) confusing due to the overloading of z - the text says these two separate values (presumably equivalent to AF2 incoming and outgoing triangle attention edges) will be stacked, while the equations say they are summed.\n\n\"and since the C-C bond length is about 1.5A.\"\n\nTable 2 is apparently showing Top-10 results, but this fact is only stated in the main text.
