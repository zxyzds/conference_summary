    "title": "A mechanistically interpretable neural network for regulatory genomics",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in mapping genomic DNA sequences to associated readouts (e.g., protein\u2013DNA binding). Beyond prediction, the goal of these networks is to reveal to scientists the underlying motifs (and their syntax) which drive genome regulation. Traditional methods that extract motifs from convolutional filters suffer from the uninterpretable dispersion of information across filters and layers. Other methods which rely on importance scores can be unstable and unreliable. Instead, we designed a novel mechanistically interpretable architecture for regulatory genomics, where motifs and their syntax are directly encoded and readable from the learned weights and activations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence of our architecture's full expressivity, while still being highly interpretable. Through several experiments, we show that our architecture excels in de novo motif discovery and motif instance calling, is robust to variable sequence contexts, and enables fully interpretable generation of novel functional sequences.",

The model is designed to directly encode biologically meaningful motifs in its weights and activations. Exhaustive experiments show ARGMINN's strength in motif discovery, instance calling, robustness, and interpretable sequence generation. This work successfully narrows the gap between the high predictive performance of DNNs and the need for interpretability in genomics prediction."

Hence, recent tools consider such variants for accurate and actual genome-specific binding [4].\nFor both, open chromatin and variant data, how would the model incorporate this essential knowledge? How does it perform compared to existing work?\n- There is a plethora of deep learning-based tools for predicting TF-binding [5,6,7,8], how does the presented approach compare to them quantitatively? With generic attribution methods, such as layer-wise-relevance propagation or SmoothGrad, extraction of motif sequences that the models respond to can be similarly achieved for these deep architectures \u2013 are your motifs qualitatively and quantitatively (e.g. similarity between discovered and known motif) better?\n- It is unclear why motifs need to be learned, as there exist extensive motif databases (TRANSFAC, JASPAR, ...) that were generated through rigorous (wet-lab) experiments. Why is it better to use an (inaccurate) inferred motif than detecting motif occurrence and then building a classifier based on that? The paper would benefit from a use-case where the existing databases can not help (e.g., TFs where motifs are not available, or relevant species were no database is available).\n- The quality of prediction is not properly evaluated against existing methods (including non-DL models), it is hence unclear whether the interpretability is traded off for prediction quality that would harm downstream applications. A proper comparison and evaluation in that regard would improve the paper.\n\n[1] https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn6131484/wiki/402037, and associated conference tracks at RECOMB/ISCB 2016\n\n[2] J Keilwagen, S Posch, J Grau, Accurate prediction of cell type-specific transcription factor binding Genome Biology 2019\n\n[3] F Schmidt, F Kern, MH Schulz, Integrative prediction of gene expression with chromatin accessibility and conformation data Epigenetics & Chromatin 2020\n\n[4] R Steinhaus, PN Robinson, D Seelow, FABIAN-variant: predicting the effects of DNA variants on transcription factor binding Nucleic Acids Research 2022\n\n[5] L Cao et al., Prediction of Transcription Factor Binding Sites Using a Combined Deep Learning Approach Frontiers in Oncology 2022\n\n[6] N Ghosh et al., Predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites with Deep Learning Int J Mol Sci 2024\n\n[7] C Chen et al., DeepGRN: prediction of transcription factor binding site across cell-types using attention-based deep neural networks BMC Bioinformatics 2021\n\n[8] GB Kim et al., DeepTFactor: A deep learning-based tool for the prediction of transcription factors PNAS 2020"
