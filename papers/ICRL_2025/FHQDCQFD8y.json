    "title": "Grad-TopoCAM: EEG Brain Region Visual Interpretability via Gradient-Based Topographic Class Activation Map",
    "abstract": "The visualization and interpretability of electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding significantly contribute to brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and cognitive neuroscience. Although some existing research has attempted to map EEG features to specific brain regions, these approaches fail to fully utilize raw signals and lack extensibility to other Deep Learning (DL) models. In this work, Grad-TopoCAM (Gradient-Based Topographic Class Activation Map) is proposed, which enhances interpretability in DL models for EEG decoding adaptively. Grad-TopoCAM calculates the gradient of feature maps for the target class at the target layer. The weights of the feature maps are obtained through global average pooling of the gradients. The class activation map is generated by performing a linear combination of weights and feature maps, which is subsequently mapped to different brain regions. Grad-TopoCAM is validated across eight DL models on four public datasets. Experimental results indicate that Grad-TopoCAM effectively identifies and visualizes brain regions that significantly influence decoding outcomes, while also facilitating channel selection for different decoding tasks. The code and data are open-source.",

The proposed Grad-TopoCAM is employed for visualization analysis on the model with the highest accuracy for each subject. However, it\u2019s noticed that the visualized features can be very different across subjects. In addition to the individual variability, are the learned features related to the models? Is it a fair comparison for the features learned by different models?\n3. Although visualization is important for interpreting results, the proposed method does not enhance decoding performance or provide unique neuroscience insights. The authors may consider either improving its methodological novelty or deepening its neuroscience contributions."

In the related work section, it is unclear why 'employing a two-dimensional convolutional structure' is a limitation as this is a common approach for most of the works in the EEG field.\n2. The key weakness is that there is no comparison to the state-of-the-art or any other work in the field. For a typical explainable AI work, there should be comparison with other existing explainability methods and demonstrate how the proposed work is superior. It is unclear how the performance of the proposed method really differ from the regular Grad-CAM in general. \nSome of the baselines for comparison can be considered: LIME, Grad-CAM, GNN-Explainer, Attention-based methods etc.\n3. In section 4.3 discussion of dataset III and IV. it is unclear how the patterns of brain activations are 'similar' when the topography plots are clearly different. Even if the topography plots are similar, the Chinese characters and English words have different meaning so it is not possible to justify there is common cognitive processing mechanisms between the two languages in this case.\n4. In section 5.2, the channel selection results have high variations, the 20% increase for subject 6 is not generalizable to other subjects or datasets and there is no significance measurement for the effect of channel selection. It is unclear how effective or ineffective the channel selection method is.\n5. There is a lack of ablation studies to prove the importance of those channels-identified. For instance, if those channels were removed, there should be a significant drop of classification performance."

Some unnecessary section titles, such as Acknowledgments and Appendices, should not be included. The tables are not aesthetically pleasing; why not omit the percentage sign (%)?
