    "title": "Inverse Engineering Diffusion: Deriving Variance Schedules with Rationale",
    "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of diffusion models is the variance schedule, which governs the evolution of variance throughout the diffusion process. Despite numerous studies exploring variance schedules, little effort has been made to understand the variance distributions implied by sampling from these schedules and how it benefits both training and data generation. We introduce a novel perspective on score-based diffusion models, bridging the gap between the variance schedule and its underlying variance distribution. Specifically, we propose the notion of sampling variance according to a probabilistic rationale, which induces a density. Our approach views the inverse of the variance schedule as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its first derivative as a probability density function (PDF) of the variance distribution. This formulation not only offers a unified view of variance schedules but also allows for the direct engineering of a variance schedule from the probabilistic rationale of its inverse function. Additionally, our framework is not limited to CDFs with closed-form inverse solutions, enabling the exploration of variance schedules that are unattainable through conventional methods. We present the tools required to obtain a diverse array of novel variance schedules tailored to specific rationales, such as separability metrics or prior beliefs. These schedules may exhibit varied dynamics, ranging from rapid convergence towards zero to prolonged periods in high-variance regions. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy of enhancing the performance of diffusion models with schedules distinct from those encountered during training. We provide a principled and unified approach to variance schedules in diffusion models, revealing the relationship between variance schedules and their underlying probabilistic rationales, which yields notable improvements in image generation performance, as measured by FID.",

                "value": "This work introduces an approach to understand and design variance schedules in diffusion models, particularly in the context of score-based diffusion frameworks. It emphasizes the importance of the variance schedule in both training and sampling phases, proposing a probabilistic rationale for constructing these schedules. The paper introduces the concept of \"rationales,\" which are functions that define how variance is distributed throughout the diffusion process. By treating the inverse of a variance schedule as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its derivative as a probability density function (PDF), the framework allows for more flexible and diverse variance schedules. The paper demonstrates that different schedules\u2014such as those derived from the squared L2-norm or the VE schedule\u2014can impact both model convergence during training and performance during sampling."

The proposed framework introduces complexity by requiring a detailed understanding of probability distributions (CDFs, PDFs) and variance schedules, which may be difficult for some practitioners and impact its applicability. While the rationale approach is novel, it may be challenging for users to easily select or engineer appropriate rationales in real-world applications, especially without closed-form solutions for some CDFs.\n2. In some cases, such as training with the squared L2-norm rationale, the model showed overfitting on smaller datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10), which could be problematic for practical use in certain domains or tasks.\n3. Some of results shown in section 4 results seem not statistical significantly different if we consider its variance, for example in table 1 and table 2. Also in Figure 2 (b), the 3rd plot, there is extremely small difference among V2,  squared L2 sampling, normal sampling; and their superiority order change as number of optimization step increase. \n4. some typos: row 132, \"defintion\"; row 478 has \" 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 2\u00d7, and 2\u00d7 the base feature-size\": not sure if this is expected."

It's introduced and described in an unclear fashion, yet the resulting computations follow from the 1-1 invertible relationship between sigma(t) and time.  Focusing design on the unnormalized density rather than the sigma(t) function is reasonable, especially given the connection to loss weighting as described in Section 3.4, but the reparameterization is straightforward.\n\n- Many of the theoretical contributions have been used previously.  Including, for example, the ability to use different noise schedules at sampling and training, that loss can be written entirely in terms of SNR sampling (or equivalently variance sampling without mean scaling), and that loss weighting is equivalent to sampling from a different distribution.  The paper could be improved by clarifying what is novel.  \n\n- The empirical results do not appear to lead to strong conclusions about what noise schedule should be used at training or sampling time.  While the conclusion that separating training and sampling schedules is reasonable and interesting, it follows from the pre-existing prevalence of loss weighting schemes.  Further, the variances schedules examined (VE, L2-Norm, and Gaussian) only include one from prior literature which limits the significance of the comparison.  The introduced L2-Norm and Gaussian rationales receive relatively little motivation."
