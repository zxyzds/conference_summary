    "title": "SHIELD: Multi-task Multi-distribution Vehicle Routing Solver with Sparsity & Hierarchy in Efficiently Layered Decoder",
    "abstract": "Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles. Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically choose whether to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.",

                "value": "This paper introduces the Multi-Task Multi-Distribution Vehicle Routing Problem (MTMDVRP), an extension of the MTVRP. The MTMDVRP effectively captures the complexities inherent in real-world industrial applications by incorporating various realistic customer distributions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a neural solver, SHIELD, which integrates soft clustering, Mixture of Experts, and Mixture-of-Depths (MoD), demonstrating remarkable generalization across various variants of VRP."

All symbols used in the figure should be adequately introduced in the text.\n\n\n2. Section 4, Methodology, lacks clarity in its description and does not comprehensively explain the forward process of the model. First, in Section 4.3, the $k$ and $N-k$ are introduced, followed by $\\beta$ and other components. However, the transition to $\\beta$ feels abrupt, necessitating multiple readings for clarity. Additionally, the calculation of $\\alpha_d$ in lines 312-319 appears abrupt, and the term $W_{\\theta}^{T}$ is not sufficiently explained either beforehand or subsequently. I recommend that the authors reorganize the logic in Section 4 to facilitate a clearer understanding of the paper's core concepts.\n\n\n3. As mentioned in the paper, the introduction of MoD and soft clustering enhances generalization; however, the generalization capabilities for larger-scale problems have not yet been tested. Therefore, I think the results of larger-scale experiments should be also presented. \n\n\n4. Although the effects of soft clustering are briefly discussed in lines 468-472, this section is concise and does not adequately explain the advantages of this method. I suggest that the authors provide a detailed experimental comparison between SHIELD-MoD and SHIELD to offer a more intuitive and in-depth understanding of the benefits introduced by this approach."

How the distribution set $\\mathcal{Q}$ is created and sampled? Where is the MD part in the training of SHIELD? \n- The benefits of MoD is hypothetical (line 285-288). The author did not provide evidence to their claims of the benefits of MoD. If they could show evidence of under- and over-processing of tokens lead to bad results, the paper would be stronger. \n- The finding in this paper seems to contradict that of MoD ((Raposo et al., 2024), the paper on which this paper is based on but the author didn't discuss it. Line 188 states that MoD makes the performance slightly worse but this paper report possitive result with MoD. \n- The reason for choosing the 9 countries is not stated in the paper. What is the performance of the proposed method on other countries in the dataset?\n- It is unclear that the proposed method really improves OOD generalization. What I can see from the tables is that SHIELD performs well InD so it performs well OOD. Other methods seem to have the about same OOD - InD performance gap with SHIELD (table 1). From the data, it is hard to conclude that MoD improves OOD generalization. \n- There is no comparison on model size and speed. The author showed that by increasing the size of MVMoE, they can get better results. A natural questions is that whether the performance improvement of SHIELD simply due to its higher capacity? \n- The writing is not good. There are many hard to understand statements and incorrect uses of words. Instead of using complex words, I think the author should use simple language to clearly explain their ideas."

As the benefit of clustering nodes has already been discussed in previous works [1], the contribution of adapting it in the proposed method is very limited. \n3. As multi-task VRPs and multi-distribution VRPs have already been studied in previous works respectively, the necessity and challenges of the proposed multi-task multi-distribution VRPs should be discussed.

There is a crucial weakness that the solution time is not reflected in the experiment, which makes it difficult to understand the computational efficiency of the algorithm.
