    "title": "SpikSSD: Better Extraction and Fusion for Object Detection with Spiking Neuron Networks",
    "abstract": "As the third generation of neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their low energy consumption and biological interpretability. Recently, SNNs have made considerable advancements in computer vision. However, efficiently conducting feature extraction and fusion under the spiking characteristics of SNNs for object detection remains a pressing challenge. To address this problem, we propose the SpikSSD, a novel Spiking Single Shot Multibox Detector. Specifically, we design a full-spiking backbone network, MDS-ResNet, which effectively adjusts the membrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better spiking feature extraction. Additionally, for spiking feature fusion, we introduce the Spiking Bi-direction Fusion Module (SBFM), which for the first time realizes bi-direction fusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of the model. Experimental results show that SpikSSD achieves 40.8\\% mAP on the GEN1 dataset and 76.0\\% mAP@0.5 on the VOC 2007 dataset with only around 10\\% firing rate, outperforming existing SNN-based approaches at ultralow energy consumption. This work sets a new benchmark for future research in SNN-based object detection. Our code is publicly available in supplementary materials.",

VOC dataset has much fewer images, which lacks of utility. There should be experiments on MS-COCO dataset and real-world images for validation qualitatively.\n\n2.SBFM is too complicated for SNN-based network. SBFM fuses different scales of feature maps, but it is too complicated for training. To meet the requirement of SSD detection head, multiple features need to be generated. SBFM has a PAN-like structure but with 5 feature maps. There could be a more efficient way of feature fusion other than the proposed SBFM.\n\n3.The MDS-ResNet primarily extends SNN modules on mature ANN networks, which lacks new design or new insight on SNN. Core ideas like membrane-based shortcuts and spiking feature fusion have seen prior application.\n\nSpikSSD provides a model that is interesting but the contributions are incremental, offering refinements on existing modules rather than making novel breakthroughs. Additionally, without real-world experiments, it is hard to identify the claimed efficiency gains. The paper would benefit from hardware validation and further simplification for real-world deployment or application, rather than merely experimenting on certain dataset."

The paper could be strengthened by including more diverse datasets or a comprehensive analysis of SpikSSD's generalization capabilities. While the paper introduces the MDS to stabilize membrane synaptic inputs, the theoretical foundations are only briefly discussed. A more rigorous exploration of why MDS effectively stabilizes membrane potential and prevents gradient vanishing/explosion would strengthen the paper\u2019s contributions. Additionally, it\u2019s unclear how the MDS compares with existing methods for managing synaptic input variance in SNNs. Although the results are promising, the comparisons are limited to SNN-based models. The paper would benefit from a broader comparison with non-SNN state-of-the-art object detectors on similar datasets to better highlight SpikSSD's competitiveness in real-world applications. Given that SNNs are often measured against ANN counterparts, direct ANN comparisons could showcase where SNNs might still be falling short. While SBFM achieves bi-directional fusion, the paper lacks a detailed justification of why this method is uniquely advantageous in SNNs as opposed to standard fusion techniques. It would also be helpful to clarify the specific benefits of using a spiking-only architecture over incorporating mixed approaches if they offer potential improvements in performance. The paper does not include ablation studies to validate the specific contributions of MDS-ResNet and SBFM. Without this, it is difficult to assess whether the performance gains are directly attributable to these components. Such studies could better clarify the impact of each proposed module."

Moreover, the gradient analysis of MDS-ResNet is similar to EMS-ResNet. Therefore, I believe that the MDS-ResNet architecture should not be regarded as a main contribution of this paper. I suggest that the authors detail why MDS-Block is more effective for object detection tasks than MS-Block and EMS-Block.\n2. The SpikSSD is only evaluated on VOC 2007 and GEN1 datasets, while EMS-ResNet is evaluated mainly on COCO 2017 dataset. I wonder if SpikSSD also works well on COCO 2017.
