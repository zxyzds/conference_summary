    "title": "Bayesian Optimization of Antibodies Informed by a Generative Model of Evolving Sequences",
    "abstract": "To build effective therapeutics, biologists iteratively mutate antibody sequences to improve binding and stability. Proposed mutations can be informed by previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to predict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies is enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies on a budget. Here we introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies in our bodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a *clonal family*. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody in our bodies. We guide our designs to fit previous measurements using a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic *in silico* experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in *in vitro* wet lab experiments.",

Antibody is a specific protein type that highly reliable on its structure to perform. Even though stucture data are scarse, authors should demonstrate CloneBO\u2019s supriority by showing that using massive sequence data can lead to higher performance only using sequence.\n2.

Reported results significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Improvements are reported both in silico (through better predicted scores of trained oracles) and with in vitro experiments, which significantly strengthens the contribution."

A clear explanation would be helpful. \n* Line 39: \u201cup to thousands of previous iterations\u201d this is somewhat misleading, not all iterations are the same as in many cases these are done in batches (\u201cmeasurements\u201d are always done in batches), and batch-iterations rarely exceed 10. In silico iterations can reach thousands but the description here is blurry and especially \u201cmeasurements\u201d is best reserved for real world queries rather than oracle queries."

While humanized VHHs do look kinda like human VH chain, they are still different, even in trivial ways (e.g. they often have much longer CDR H3). It's nice that the proposed method deals with this distribution shift, but it's not entierly fair to compare to the baselines, that were only developed for 'normal' Abs.\n\nIn the paper you write \"de novo design method DiffAb\", but DiffAb it's not de novo, it needs a co-crystal structure as a starting point.\n\nFigure 4 (b) second plot, only 1 point beats best point of Lambo, the average of Lambo also looks better so I'm not fully convinced that the proposed method produces more stable antibodies. Of course, the KD results are quite convincing."
