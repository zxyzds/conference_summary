    "title": "FIG: Flow with Interpolant Guidance for Linear Inverse Problems",
    "abstract": "Diffusion and flow matching models have been recently used to solve various linear inverse problems such as image restoration. Using a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching model as a prior, most existing methods modify the reverse-time sampling process by incorporating the likelihood information from the measurement. However, they struggle in challenging scenarios, e.g., in case of high measurement noise or severe ill-posedness. In this paper, we propose `Flow with Interpolant Guidance' (FIG), an algorithm  where the reverse-time sampling is efficiently guided with measurement interpolants through theoretically justified schemes. Experimentally, we demonstrate that FIG efficiently produce highly competitive results  on a variety of linear image reconstruction tasks on natural image datasets. We improve upon state-of-the-art baseline algorithms, especially for challenging tasks. Code will be released.",

                "value": "The authors propose a method, FIG, to pre-train a flow matching or diffusion model to be used as a prior to solve linear inverse problems. FIG considers the conditioning on the measurements in the diffusion process. However, instead of using the direct measurement y, it conditions on the \u201cmeasurement interpolants\u201d y_t, as it generates x_t. The authors show that for specific choices of the interplant, the relationship between the signal x_t and the measurement y_t hold with the same linear model of the inverse problem (and adjusted additive noise magnitude).\nTheoretical guarantees are provided for the correctness of the proposed optimiser and sampler. FIG is also tested on several inverse problems (SR x4/x16, Gaussian/Motion deblurring, inpainting) and yields state of the art results."

Possibly this is connected to the previous point. I suggest to 1) add a brief paragraph after each theorem explaining its practical implications; 2) include a discussion subsection that ties together how the theorems collectively justify or enable the proposed method; 3) provide intuitive explanations or examples to complement the formal mathematical statements."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Technically, the paper lacks significant contributions that clearly distinguish it from prior work. My concerns are as follows:\n\n1. **Inverse Problem Approach**: Solving an inverse problem with pre-trained diffusion/flow matching models typically involves classifier guidance by designing a robust $q(y|x_t)$ term, as Bayes\u2019 rule suggests: $\\nabla p(x|y) = \\nabla p(x) + \\nabla p(y|x)$. However, the authors do not propose a novel method for posterior estimation. Equation (16) indicates that this work adheres to the scheme outlined in the [DPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14687) paper, using reconstruction guidance.\n\n2. **Application of Existing Methods**: This paper seems primarily focused on adapting DPS to flow matching models, with only minor adjustments to weighting terms.\n\n3. **Theorem 1**: This theorem has been discussed in previous work. For example, the [stochastic interpolant](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15571) paper (Appendix F) provides a proof connecting unconditional flow and score-based models. Similarly, [OT-ODE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04432) and [C-PG(D/F)M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17673) offer similar proofs for inverse problem solutions. Thus, Theorem 1 could be moved to the appendix, rather than highlighted as a primary contribution.\n\n4. **Omission of Related Work**: The paper omits mention of highly related work, such as [C-PG(D/F)M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17673), which specifically addresses efficiency in solving inverse problems using both flow matching and diffusion models. As this work was posted on arXiv in May, it should be acknowledged, and I recommend that the authors review it thoroughly.\n\n5. **Efficiency Claims**: The authors assert, \"Despite promising experimental results, we find prior works struggle to efficiently handle challenging linear inverse problems,\" which is questionable. It seems the key contribution here is an additional iterative update at each ODE solving step (Algorithm 1, lines 7-8), introducing a hyperparameter $K$. For $K > 1$, this approach could increase inference time due to additional gradient calculations. Although this gradient term may not be computationally prohibitive for linear transformations $A$, it could become costly for non-linear transformations. While the authors focus on the linear case, the method could potentially be extended to non-linear cases using heuristics, as seen in [$\\Pi$GDM](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9_gsMA8MRKQ).\n\n    - **Efficient Inverse Problem Solutions**: Achieving efficiency typically involves (1) reducing NFE (Number of Function Evaluations) without sacrificing quality (e.g., [C-PG(D/F)M](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17673) achieves NFE=5 for inverse problem solutions), and (2) avoiding costly gradient calculations (e.g., [Red-Diff](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04391)).\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation could be improved. PSNR and SSIM are no longer reliable metrics for generative model assessment, especially when leveraging pre-trained unconditional models. Instead, metrics like FID and KID should be considered."
