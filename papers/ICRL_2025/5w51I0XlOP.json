    "title": "Self-Choose: Leveraging Diverse Reasoning Solutions to Self-Correct Multimodal Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "In the past few years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in reasoning while still suffering from mistakes. Some existing approaches on LLMs self-correct the answers without external feedback, proven limited in reasoning. We revisit these previous approaches and propose an improved effective strategy dubbed Self-Choose to teach MLLMs to utilize diverse reasoning solutions to self-correct reasoning. Our approach first employs various reasoning methods to generate candidate answers. Then, it evaluates them by comparing the reasoning processes and candidate answers to choose the optimal solution. Finally, it outputs the best candidate or reflects to generate an improved solution if all the answers are deemed inaccurate. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets with mainstream foundation models including LLaVA and Gemini. The extensive experiments show that Self-Choose achieves consistent improvements on different benchmarks and metrics. We hope this study will promote future research on self-correction and its application across various tasks.",

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. My primary concern is novelty, especially in the popular field of prompting strategies for MLLMs. \n\n    (a.) Firstly, this paper presents limited literature reviews and comparison studies in the self-correct domain to effectively distinguish itself from existing methods. \n\n    (b.) Secondly, the idea of having multiple reasoning paths is not new and resembles ToT[1], SCoT[2], StrategyLLM[3], etc., which the authors do not address at all in the paper. \n\n    (c.) Finally, this method is overly simplified and straight-forward. With existing methods that utilize the search engine (Self-Ask[4]), APIs (Self-Correct[5]), and Python interpreters (Self-Debug[6]) that produce more significant experiment results, this work presents more of an engineering solution than a research advancement. \n\n2. The baselines are very limited. The paper only compares Self-Choose against Self-Refine and Self-Review, where Self-Review is an intermediate improvement that the authors come up with on top of Self-Refine. \n\n3. The results are insignificant. For example, Self-Choose improves LLaVA-1.6-13b on ScienceQA, of 2017 QAs, by 68.86%-67.63%=1.23%. Especially when the model temperature is set to 0.3 (mentioned in Appendix C), I remain skeptical of the significance of the improvements and thus the effectiveness of such a method.\n\n4. Number of models tested are limited. Only Gemini-vision and LLaVA-1.6-13b are tested with these methods. It is unclear if the improvements can be generalized to other MLLMs of various sizes. \n\n5. The claim in L62-63 \u201cthe model fails to correct itself with a fixed thinking pattern\u201d is also derived from an analogy to psychological phenomenon and has no scientific studies to back it up.\n\n    (a.) In Table 4, the ablation study \u201cw/o processes s_i\u201d presents very similar performance to Self-Choose: 68.81% vs. 68.86% on ScienceQA, 62.00% vs. 62.65% on WHOOPS. If no thinking processes are presented to the MLLMs and they still achieve similar results, it means that it is not the thinking processes that are boosting the performance, which contradicts with the authors claim that they have \u201cfixed thinking pattern\u201d.\n\n6. It is unclear why MAD and MRP are introduced in section 5.4.3 and how their results affect authors findings.\n\n7. In L104-106, authors mention that they \u201cconduct experiments applying self-correction techniques originally designed for LLMs to MLLMs\u201d. It is unclear how this step is done.\n\n8. It is unclear how LLMs are utilized as an evaluator for experiments on WHOOPS and MM-Vet as mentioned in L291-292.\n\n9. In the ablation study \u201cGenerate\u201d, the authors prompt the models saying that \u201call candidate answers are inaccurate\u201d which is misleading to the models and not an effective ablation study, as the setup falls back on the issues with Self-Refine. A better ablation would be asking the model to generate at all times regardless of the candidates\u2019 correctness.\n\n[1] Yao, Shunyu, et al. \"Tree of thoughts: Deliberate problem solving with large language models.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (2024).\\\n[2] Wang, Yu, et al. \"Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.03271 (2024).\\\n[3] Gao, Chang, et al. \"Strategyllm: Large language models as strategy generators, executors, optimizers, and evaluators for problem solving.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.08803 (2023).\\\n[4] Press, Ofir, et al. \"Measuring and narrowing the compositionality gap in language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.03350 (2022).\\\n[5] Welleck, Sean, et al. \"Generating sequences by learning to self-correct.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.00053 (2022).\\\n[6] Chen, Xinyun, et al. \"Teaching large language models to self-debug.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05128 (2023)."

In Appendix D, the authors mention that Self-Choose with LLaVA-1.6-13b on ScienceQA incorrectly changed 1.54% original answers from right to wrong and 2.73% from wrong to right. This should mean that the overall performance increase is 2.73%-1.54%=1.19%, but why is it 68.86%-67.63%=1.23% in Table 3? What are the original numbers of correct and wrong answers from the experiments?\n4. Is there a particular reason that the authors mention MAD and MRP as comparisons? And what are the findings?\n5.

Also, the analysis and case studies in this paper also do not emphasize that why multimodal context is essential.\n- Based on point 1, the paper lacks a comprehensive analysis that evaluates the effectiveness of these methods in a non-multimodal context (they include the preliminary results on GSM8K in appendix, which should be placed in the main context). This omission weakens the justification for a multimodal focus. To strengthen the paper, the authors should either conduct more comprehensive experiments to assess their methods' performance in a non-multimodal setting or provide a clearer rationale in the introduction for why multimodal reasoning is essential for this study. \n- The benchmarks chosen for evaluation in this paper (ScienceQA, WHOOPS, MM-Vet) do not comprehensively cover multimodal and reasoning-intensive tasks. Widely recognized multimodal math reasoning benchmarks such as Geometry 3K and MathVista should be included to more accurately assess and validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n- The proposed self-choose approach offers limited performance improvement over the All CCoT baseline. This marginal gain may not justify its significantly higher inference cost, especially when compared to the baseline's efficiency. Further optimization or a more compelling trade-off between performance and inference cost would strengthen the overall value of the self-choose method."

                "value": "1. The contribution is incremental. This paper is basically \"using different prompting methods to do CoT and then prompt the model to select the best one\". This approach is like a combination of **self-consistency** (sampling multiple answers and find the majority) and **self-review** (asking the model if the generated answer is correct; if wrong then write a new one). All the components in this pipeline have similar ideas in the literature and are very easy to think of based on the prior research works. This pipeline just combined these components and applied it in the multi-modal scenario.\\\nFor example, the idea of \"using different CoT prompts to sample answers\" can be found in [1,2,3]; the idea of \"sampling multiple answers and prompt the LM to select the best\" can be found in [4], not to mention it is also an incremental adjustment of the original self-consistency; \"writing a more promising answer based on sampled ones\" is also a simple adaptation of previous self-correct approaches. \n\n2. The pipeline is not tested on some more representative multi-modal reasoning tasks, to name a few, MMMU (multimodal general reasoning), RAVEN (multimodal logical reasoning), and MathVista (multimodal math reasoning). This weakens the soundness of the experiments. Moreover, the improvement on the tested benchmarks are very limited. It improves less than 1.5 points (on average) compared to only using CCoT without self-consistency (but uses more model calls which hurts efficiency). The performance gap is even smaller compared to some variants in the ablation study (Table 4), which questions the effectiveness of the components in this pipeline. I wonder if some significance test can be performed, e.g., using different random seeds for answer sampling.\n\n3. It looks like the approach is not specifically for multimodal tasks but can also be applied to single-modal (text-only) tasks, whereas the authors only provided a very simple comparison in Appendix E on GSM8k. They only compared to CoT and least-to-most reasoning without other more similar methods like self-consistency. I don't think this is solid enough to show the generalization of this method.\n\n[1] Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason\n[2] MathPrompter: Mathematical Reasoning using Large Language Models\n[3] MinT: Boosting Generalization in Mathematical Reasoning via Multi-View Fine-Tuning\n[4] Universal Self-Consistency for Large Language Model Generation"
