    "title": "On the Convergence of Symbolic Pattern Forests and Silhouette Coefficients for Robust Time Series Clustering",
    "abstract": "Clustering algorithms are fundamental to data mining, serving dual roles as exploratory tools and preprocessing steps for advanced analytics. A persistent challenge in this domain is determining the optimal number of clusters, particularly for time series data where prevalent algorithms like k-means and k-shape require a priori knowledge of cluster quantity. This paper presents the first approach to time series clustering that does not require prior specification of cluster numbers. We introduce a novel extension of the Symbolic Pattern Forest (SPF) algorithm that automatically optimizes the number of clusters for time series datasets. Our method integrates SPF for cluster generation with the Silhouette Coefficient, computed on a two-stage vector representation: first transforming time series into Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) representations, then deriving both bag-of-words and TF-IDF vectors. Rigorous evaluation on diverse datasets from the UCR archive demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms traditional baseline methods. This work contributes to the field of time series analysis by providing a truly unsupervised, data-driven approach to clustering, with potential impacts across various temporal data mining applications where the underlying number of clusters is unknown or variable.",

While these works make valuable contributions to k-estimation, we believe our approach offers unique advantages:\n- Linear time complexity (compared to quadratic)\n- Scalability to longer sequences\n- Fewer distributional assumptions\nWe will revise our introduction to better position our work within this context.\n\nW2. Regarding performance metrics\nWe appreciate your careful reading of our results. The performance differences between BoW and TF-IDF are indeed subtle but meaningful. We will enhance our presentation with:\n- Confidence intervals\n- Statistical significance tests\nThis will help readers better understand the practical implications of these differences.\n\nW3. Regarding parameter stability\nThank you for this excellent suggestion. While our extensive experiments demonstrate robustness across various parameters, we agree that a more detailed analysis would be valuable. We will add comprehensive sensitivity studies while noting that default parameters often perform well.\n\nW4.

Regarding silhouette coefficient justification\nThank you for pushing us to better justify our choice of the silhouette coefficient. While our theoretical analysis in Section 4 supports this choice, we agree that expanding our explanation would strengthen the paper. We plan to:\n- Enhance the theoretical analysis\n- Add empirical validation\nWe believe these additions will better demonstrate why silhouette coefficients are particularly well-suited for our vector representations.\n\nW2. Regarding empirical evaluation\nWe appreciate your suggestion for broader evaluation. While our current evaluation focuses on our core contribution (linear-time k-estimation), we agree that additional comparisons would be valuable. We will:\n- Add direct SPF comparisons\n- Include detailed runtime analysis\nWe would welcome suggestions for additional comparisons that maintain linear time complexity.\n\nW3. Regarding performance metrics\nThank you for this suggestion. While our metrics directly address k-estimation accuracy, we agree that adding standard clustering metrics would enable better comparison with existing literature. We will add NMI and ARI metrics.\n\nW4/W5. Regarding related work and citations\nWe appreciate your careful attention to the citations. We will revise the related work section accordingly."

Regarding technical depth\nWe greatly appreciate this concern and would like to clarify our technical contributions, which we believe are substantial:\n- A novel theoretical framework with rigorous proofs showing why silhouette coefficients succeed on our symbolic representations while failing on raw time series\n- A mathematically grounded optimization framework for joint parameter selection\n- An innovative adaptation of TF-IDF that preserves temporal characteristics\nWe would be happy to expand these sections to better communicate the technical depth of our work.\n\nW2. Regarding comparison methodology\nThank you for this insightful observation. Our vector space transformation enables principled comparisons across different distance measures, though we agree this could be better explained. We plan to:\n- Add formal analysis of distance metric properties\n- Include empirical validation of our choices\nWe believe this will help readers better understand our methodological decisions.\n\nW3. Regarding baselines\nWe appreciate your suggestions for additional baselines. Our current selection focused on methods commonly used in production systems, though we agree some additions would be valuable.

                "value": "W1. The method assumes that silhouette coefficient is a suitable metric for finding the best number of clusters, without justifying this choice. This is a major concern as the silhouette coefficient considers (Euclidean) distance to cluster centres, which is not aligned with the clustering objective of the SPF method. The paper should provide justification for using the silhouette coefficient, or discuss potential limitations of this choice given the SPF method's clustering approach. Moreover, the silhouette coefficient is a well-known metric, so it is unclear what the novelty should be.\nW2. The empirical evaluation does not consider the SPF method, but only weak baselines constructed from the proposed method, meaning that the empirical evaluation does not allow assessment of the performance of the proposed method with respect to state of the art. It is important to compare directly to SPF in the experiments, in order to demonstrate improvement over state of the art.\nW3. The empirical evaluation only considers performance metrics accuracy and near-miss-rate, different from other work in the field, and in the SPF paper (e.g. NMI), making it impossible to compare with those works directly.\nW4. The discussion of related work is overly brief, and fails to present clear assessment of the suitability of existing methods and metrics. E.g. Davies-Bouldin Index and its perceived suitability for the task. Also, there is a large body of work on similarity assessment of time series or clustering of time series, e.g. Keogh et al 2005, Rakthanmanon  et al 2012, Paparrizos et al 2015. The paper should discuss these, and explain differences and similarities with the proposed method.\nW5. On the other hand, references UTSAD and STGAT seem out of context, as they do not address clustering of time series. The paper should clarify the relevance of UTSAD and STGAT to the proposed work, or remove these references if they are indeed not directly related.\nW6. The paper contains several redundant sections, such as the description of SAX.\nW7. There are some minor issues, such that Li et al 2019 appears twice in the references, there is a typesetting error in the definition of pi_i(T_i)."

The usage of SPF is well-founded due to its low complexity. Introducing k-estimation to the approach helps mitigate one of its weaknesses."

                "value": "(W1) Novelty: The abstract of the submission makes the claim that there are no time series clustering methods capable of working without the specification of cluster number k. However, such methods exist already:\n\na) \u201cSpectral Clustering for Time Series\u201d by Fei Wang and Changshui Zhang (2005) is able to discover the optimal number of clusters based on the eigenstructure using a threshold on the value of the eigenvalues.\nb) \u201cClustering Time Series with Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Time Warping\u201d by Tim Oates et. al. (1999) also provides a way to estimate the number of clusters based on Dynamic Time Warping. However, even if the submission is not the only method that does k-estimation on time series, it is still a valid and useful direction. It also appears to be the only method that does so for the Symbolic Pattern Forest algorithm.\nc) The paper \u201cTrendlets: A novel probabilistic representational structures for clustering the time series data\u201d by Johnpaul C I et al. (2020) uses the Silhouette Score for cluster number analysis for time series as well, though it does so based on hierarchical clustering methods. This paper should be explicitly covered in related work or even a competitor.\n\n(W2) Despite TF-IDF being considered the better of the two proposed strategies, there is no actual description of the performance metrics outside of the graph and the overall relative performance value. Similarly, near misses should be added to the text for BoW. The results of both BoW and TF-IDF are the same in the Tables in the supplementary files, though Figure 1 claims that TF-IDF performed slightly better.\n\n(W3) As the method works by optimizing the silhouette score, both the values for the score and the actual clustering performance with the given parameters should be indicated. While the cluster numbers match, the detected clusters may not necessarily correspond to the actual ground truth clusters, which could further mean that different cluster numbers may lead to a better performance. Furthermore, an analysis of the stability of the parameters should have been performed, especially as the method has multiple parameters, which themselves include an upper and lower bound. Additionally, an intuition behind choosing the parameters should be given if they strongly affect the performance.\n\n(W4) Regarding the actual experiment, a better analysis of the behavior should be done, considering under what conditions the k-estimation of each of the three approaches failed and whether or not a reason behind it could be established. The section on Relative Improvement is redundant as it only recontextualizes prior results, and the space could be used to do a more in-depth result analysis instead. Similarly, the remaining 2 pages could have been used for this.\n\n(W6) Neither the parameter w nor the alpha ranges seem to be specified anywhere. The code is unavailable, though it should be possible to reimplement given the information provided. Still, this hampers the reproducibility of the results.\n\n(W7) There should be citations for TF-IDF and BoW. Other papers also do not consistently do it, so it is not a major issue. Nonetheless, it would have been better if it had been done. Furthermore, UCI should be cited upon first mention outside of the abstract, not just at a later point.\n\nMinor Issues:\n* Linear time complexity time series clustering with symbolic pattern forest by Li et. al., is cited twice as 2019a and 2019b despite referring to the same paper \n* The formatting appears to be broken for lists, as they are just written in a line without comma separation (see line 291 and lines 314-315) \n* A similar issue happened with the variables for the optimization problem, as they are also not properly separated in line 305\n* The subscript on several equations appears to be broken (see (22)/319 and (23)/321)\n* The near miss metric should probably be more dynamic based on the ground truth cluster number, as claiming 2 clusters for a 3-cluster setting seems more problematic than claiming 70 for 71 true clusters. The chosen datasets generally only have a few clusters, so the current definition isn\u2019t problematic for the submission. It may be relevant for the extension to the full UCI database, however. \n* The formulation for Near Misses, as currently given, would also include all correctly determined cluster counts but does not do so in the evaluation."

Is the performance of the SPF algorithm with the ground truth k always the best one, or could other parametrizations outperform it?\n\n(Q3) How impactful are the parameters of the proposed method?\n\n(Q4) Is there any advantage to using BoW over TF-IDF (or the other way around)?"
