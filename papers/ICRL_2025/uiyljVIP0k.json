    "title": "UNIFYING LONG AND SHORT SPATIO-TEMPORAL FORECASTING WITH SPECTRAL GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS",
    "abstract": "Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in various practical applications. Current research in this area is categorized into Spatial-Temporal Forecasting (STF) and Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). While these tasks share similarities, the methods and benchmarks used differ significantly. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) excel at modeling interrelationships in STF tasks but face difficulties with long sequence inputs due to inefficient training. In contrast, LTSF models handle long sequences well but struggle with capturing complex variable interrelationships. This paper proposes the Spectral Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (S2GNN) to address these challenges, unifying short- and long-sequence spatio-temporal forecasting within a single framework. S2GNN leverages spectral GNNs for global feature extraction incorporates an adaptive graph structure to manage varying sequence lengths and adopts a decoupled framework to improve scalability. Additionally, we introduce scale-adaptive node embeddings and cross-correlation embeddings for better differentiation between similar temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets, including both STF and LTSF datasets, demonstrate that S2GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse prediction tasks.

The author attempts to enhance model efficiency through sample indistinguishability, but the connection between sample indistinguishability and model efficiency is not clearly explained.\n\n**Originality:** The primary contribution lies in the design of embeddings, specifically a **scale-adaptive node embedding method** and a **cross-correlation embedding method**.

If the number of nodes in the test dataset exceeds that of the training dataset, can your model still make predictions accurately? Can it handle cases of missing or additional nodes?\n\n2. **As most TSF benchmarks achieve good performance within 10 epochs, why does your model require so many epochs, as shown in Figure 2?** Additionally, could you explain why the graph structure appears stable and lacks significant variation? Is it possible that this is simply the result of model convergence?\n\n3. **As stated in Section 3.1, \"This value could be the node\u2019s ID, the time of the day, or the day of the week,\" is the cross-correlation embedding method just a typical temporal embedding with an added node ID?** Please provide a more detailed comparison between the proposed embedding methods and existing temporal/positional embeddings, highlighting the key differences and advantages. This would help clarify the novelty of S2GNN.\n\n4. **I don't see any components designed specifically to optimize both short- and long-term TSF tasks.** Could you concisely explain why your model qualifies as a unified model for both short- and long-term TSF?\n\n5. **The chosen baselines are not previous SOTA, which limits the credibility of your experimental comparisons.** Please add recent SOTA baselines, e.g. itransformer, forecastgrapher."

The contributions include scale-adaptive node embeddings and cross-correlation embeddings.

I appreciate the contribution of the scale-adaptive node embeddings, which is interesting, although I don\u2019t see its connection with RIP. But the contribution is not enough for ICLR. Regarding the cross-correlation embeddings, I don\u2019t see how it can help to achieve more efficient learning to process both short and long term dependencies.\n3.\tWriting is quite poor.
