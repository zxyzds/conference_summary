    "title": "CausalRivers - Scaling up benchmarking of causal discovery for real-world time-series",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it.\nDespite this, in-the-wild evaluation is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. \nReal-world causal structures, however, are often complex, evolving over time, non-linear, and influenced by unobserved factors, making\nit hard for practitioners to select appropriate methods. \nTo bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time series data to date.\nCausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the complete eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494  measurement stations). \nIt spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution. \nFurther, we provide data from a recent flood around the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift. \nLeveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we constructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern Germany).\nThese graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to benchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings.\nTo demonstrate the utility of our benchmarking kit, we evaluate several causal discovery approaches through multiple experiments and introduce effective baselines, identifying several areas for enhancement.\nCausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods.\nBesides this primary purpose, we also expect that this dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as time series forecasting and anomaly detection.\nBased on this, we hope to establish benchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal discovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning.",

With high-frequency sampling every 15 minutes, the dataset includes data from a significant flood event on the Elbe River, making it suitable for testing causal discovery under real-world conditions with distributional shifts. The kit supports a range of causal discovery methods, from traditional approaches like Granger causality to advanced models like PCMCI, VARLINGAM, Dynotears, and CDMI, and allows sampling of subgraphs for diverse benchmarking cases. \nThe experimental evaluation uses data from 666 and 494 stations across eastern Germany and Bavaria, respectively, from 2019 to 2023. \nThe results revealed that while advanced methods struggle with real-world complexities like non-stationarity and high dimensionality, simple baselines performed robustly in identifying causal links. Domain adaptation via fine-tuning also showed performance gains."

                "value": "The benchmark dataset provided in this paper is of unprecedented scale and will undoubtedly contribute significantly to the field of causal discovery. However, the task may be somewhat simplified because the dataset is tied to geographical information. Predicting causal relationships between nearby river basins is relatively easy, meaning that causal discovery might only need to focus on a limited subset of the series. This could slightly diminish the dataset's overall value. The experiments seem to focus only on causal discovery within subsets of the time series. A broader evaluation of causal discovery across all series could lead to a more in-depth discussion.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few minor typographical errors. For instance, in Section 3.2.1, the phrase \"benchmarking kid\" should be corrected to \"benchmarking kit.\" Moreover, variables with upper bars are used in the same section without explanation, and the notation should be clearly defined."
