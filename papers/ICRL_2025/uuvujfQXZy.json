    "title": "Selective Concept Bottleneck Models Without Predefined Concepts",
    "abstract": "Concept-based models like Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered significant interest for improving model interpretability by first predicting human-understandable concepts before mapping them to the output classes. Early approaches required costly concept annotations. To alleviate such, recent methods utilized large language models to automatically generate class-specific concept descriptions and learned mappings from a pretrained black-box model\u2019s raw features to these concepts using vision-language models. However, these approaches assume prior knowledge of which concepts the black-box model has learned. In this work, we discover the concepts encoded by the model through unsupervised concept discovery techniques instead. We further propose an input-dependent concept selection mechanism that dynamically retains a sparse set of relevant concepts for each input, enhancing both sparsity and interpretability. Our approach not only improves downstream performance but also needs significantly fewer concepts for accurate classification. Lastly, we show how large vision-language models can guide the editing of our models' weights to correct errors.",

                "value": "The paper proposes Selective CBMs (UCBMs in the paper) - a novel mechanism that converts any pre-trained model into a CBM. CBMs have been trained using concept annotations in the bottleneck layer which is a significant drawback. To solve this, authors take inspiration from Post-hoc CBMs [1] wherein the concepts are \"discovered\" in the latent (feature) space and then can be combined together in an interpretable manner to make the final label prediction. UCBMs first decompose (non-understandable) features into an interpretable set of concept representations using a sparse matrix [This is where the problem is formulated as a dictionary learning objective]. Next, the concepts learned are assigned scores based on cosine similarity with the features - giving them weights corresponding to their impact on prediction. The final weight matrix W is also regularized to be sparse. In addition, input-dependent concept selection has been proposed to only select a few concepts as multiple works show that only a few concepts are responsible for prediction. Experiments are performed on ImageNet, CUB, and Places365 wherein UCBM beats [1]. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that UCBMs are intervenable.\n\n[1] POST-HOC CONCEPT BOTTLENECK MODELS, Yuksekgonul et al."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Lack of novelty: In my opinion, UCBM makes two distinct assumptions. First (well-grounded) - concepts form the basis of the latent space and can be linearly decomposed into concepts using a sparse matrix which has been well studied in [2,3]. Second, the novel concept selection module has been utilized in [4,5,6] wherein an auxiliary branch is utilized to directly predict 'the most important' concepts for predictions. This severely limits the novelty of the proposed modules.\n2. Interpretability of $C$'s: I have some doubts over the effectiveness of the concepts $C$ as an interpretable unit. As shown in [7], even feature activations can be an effective interpretability metric if properly tuned. Refer Fig 6 in [7] where the most activating prototypes are aligned. In contrast to [1] UCBM has no pre-selected prototypes making the interpretation of each concept in $C$ ambiguous and up to the user's choice.\n2a. Weakness 2 makes me apprehensive about the results in Table-1. UCBM w/o concept selection is basically a Black-box model with some added sparsity regularization and the supposed presence of \"interpretable\" concepts. In my opinion, \"w/o concept selection\" row is not a significant metric to judge the efficacy of this approach.\n3. As the work focuses on unsupervised concept discovery, some experiments with models such as SENN [7] or similar approaches should be performed. One metric that could have demonstrated good concept decomposition is the diversity between each c ($\\in$ C) and how different they are to each other.\n4. Lacking Experiments:  The experiments have only been performed on 3 datasets with only CNN model architectures. As a truly generic approach, experiments on ViT-based architectures should also be performed.\n5. Doubts over utilizing similarity between activations and concepts as scores: What does a high or low score imply? Let's say the similarity value is 1, does it imply that the activation is in itself interpretable? I fail to understand why such a measure should be used and cannot learned automatically.\n\n\n\n[2] Interpretable Basis Decomposition for Visual Explanation, Zhou et al., ECCV\n\n[3] Uncovering Unique Concept Vectors through Latent Space Decomposition, Grazini et al., TMLR\n\n[4] Learning Bottleneck Concepts in Image Classification, Wang et al., CVPR\n\n[5] A Framework for Learning Ante-hoc Explainable Models via Concepts, Sarkar et al., CVPR\n\n[6] Self-explaining Neural Architecture for Generalizable Concept Learning, Sinha et al., IJCAI\n\n[7] Towards Robust Interpretability with Self-Explaining Neural Networks,  Alvarez-Melis et al.

The title states the word \"Selective\" but it has never been used again in the paper itself.\n \n2. CBMs are known to be fragile and can cause \"leakage\". Does UCBM also face similar problems?

This paper uses an existing matrix decomposition method called CRAFT for feature generation, and the novelty of this paper is limited to proposing input-dependant selection applied before learning the sparse linear layer.\n2. The paper lacks comparisons with the newer methods in terms of performance and sparsity[1,2,3]. Particularly, this work should be compared to [2], which trains a learnable dictionary to approximate the embedding space of VLMs in a supervised manner without using a pre-defined concept set.\n3. The paper lacks results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and shows results on just three datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of this method in wide scenarios, the results should be provided on additional datasets, including Actions: UCF-101, Textures: DTD, and Skin tumors: HAM10000 following [2].\n4.

The concepts discovered is represented visually instead of textually. From my view, textual concept representation is an important feature of CBMs as it provides more concise and user-friendly description. I agree that the introduction of unsupervised concept discovery into CBM is interesting but the missing of text representation limits the novelty. \n\n[1] Panousis, Konstantinos Panagiotis, Dino Ienco, and Diego Marcos. \"Sparse linear concept discovery models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023."
