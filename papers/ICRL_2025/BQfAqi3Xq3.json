    "title": "INDOOR-3.6M : A Multi-Modal Image Dataset for Indoor Geolocation",
    "abstract": "Indoor image geolocation, the task of determining the location of an indoor scene based on visual content, presents unique challenges due to the constrained and repetitive nature of indoor spaces. Current geolocation methods, while advanced in outdoor contexts, struggle to perform accurately in indoor environments due to the lack of diverse and representative indoor datasets. To address this gap, we introduce INDOOR-3.6M, a large-scale dataset of geotagged indoor imagery spanning various residential, commercial, and public spaces from around the world. In addition to the data set, we propose a new sampling methodology to ensure geographic diversity and balance. We also introduce INDOOR-15K, a benchmark for evaluating indoor-specific geolocation models. Finally, we demonstrate the dataset\u2019s utility by introducing IndoorGeoCLIP, a specialized version of the GeoCLIP model fine-tuned using our dataset, which outperforms GeoCLIP on our test set.",

                "value": "- This paper addresses a relevant gap in image geolocation by creating a dataset specifically for indoor environments. Existing datasets primarily focus on outdoor scenes, making them unsuitable for the unique challenges of indoor geolocation. The creation of the dataset, along with the development of a specialized indoor geolocation benchmark (INDOOR-15K) are novel contributions. \n\n- The dataset seems carefully curated and includes metadata, such as scene classification and object segmentation, which add to its potential applications. The use of the Places365 ResNet indoor/outdoor image classifier to filter images is good. Further, the effort to mitigate data leakage concerns by selecting images captured after 2017 for the INDOOR-15K benchmark demonstrates a commitment to quality and reliable evaluation.\n\n- The paper is well-written and structured logically, making it easy to understand. The authors clearly articulate the challenges of indoor geolocation and provide a good overview of existing datasets and their limitations. \n\n- The INDOOR-3.6M dataset has the potential for numerous interesting applications. The most direct is the development and evaluation of more robust and accurate indoor geolocation models. The dataset can also facilitate research in related areas, such as indoor navigation, scene understanding, and place recognition."

Exploring and comparing the performance of other state-of-the-art geolocation models or techniques on INDOOR-15K would strengthen the analysis. Additionally, the authors could include a more in-depth error analysis to identify the specific challenges posed by indoor geolocation, and what it can be used for, to guide future research.\n\n- The paper primarily focuses on creating and describing the dataset. It lacks a thorough demonstration of the dataset's usefulness beyond the fine-tuning of GeoCLIP. Further experiments and analyses showcasing the dataset's application in tasks like place recognition, or indoor navigation would strengthen the paper significantly.\n\n- The reliance on URLs to online sources for data access could lead to unreliable data availability, where links might become broken over time, limiting the dataset's long-term usability. The authors should consider providing alternative access methods, such as potentially mirroring the links."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- In line 231, the paper mentions collecting images from the internet that contain latitude and longitude coordinates. Is there a human review mechanism to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the geographic information in these images? Additionally, even if the images themselves are under a CC license, is there a protocol to blur potential privacy-sensitive information within the images, such as faces, intimate clothing, etc.?\n- Could the release of this dataset lead to illegal applications, such as using images (e.g., from social media) to obtain the user locations (even if they don\u2019t want others to know their location), thereby introducing security risks?\n- In line 490, the proposed dataset only provides URLs. These URLs may become inaccessible over time, especially for sites where links frequently change, such as booking websites (with some hotels even removing pages). How does the dataset plan to address the potential issue of broken or inaccessible URLs?\n- Is it reasonable to determine geographic information solely from images? Have experiments been conducted for more complex cases? For example, (1) many hotel chains use standardized decor, so to what extent can images alone reliably confirm the location of, say, the same hotel brand in the U.S. versus China? (2) Different individuals may have distinct decor and layout styles that may be more indicative of personal taste than geographic location. For instance, a Chinese staff working in the U.S. might have a TV studio with a Chinese interior style. To what extent can models accurately recognize the geographic location in such cases?\n- The paper lacks a detailed description and explanation of the proposed IndoorGeoCLIP model. Are the authors only fine-tuning the existing GeoCLIP model using their proposed dataset? If so, this contribution might be seen as insufficiently significant and could be considered merely a necessary experiment to support the dataset.\n- The experiments seem insufficient. The authors should consider using more existing methods to evaluate the proposed Indoor15K benchmark; currently, Table 3 includes only GeoCLIP, which seems inadequate. Additionally, in Table 3, wouldn\u2019t it be more intuitive to label IndoorGeoCLIP directly as \u201cGeoCLIP (fine-tuning)\u201d?\n- I acknowledge the authors\u2019 introduction of an interesting sampling strategy, but they have not demonstrated its advantages through appropriate ablation studies. I also believe this sampling method could be beneficial for other geolocation datasets (both indoor and outdoor), and further verification of its performance and feasibility would be valuable.\n- In the supplementary material, the download_images.py code essentially functions as an automated data-scraping script that downloads images through URLs. It raises the question of whether the authors have obtained proper authorization from all websites involved in the dataset to conduct automated data scraping."

Can the fine-tuned models achieve better accuracy on the indoor subset of the other datasets?\n- What is the accuracy merit by the proposed dataset additional to the existing resource? Say if we train on a combined indoor data from existing datasets (e.g., Im2GPS, YFCC100M, MP-16, Hotels50k), what is the additional accuracy boost by adding the proposed INDOOR-3.6M?\n\nThe sampling strategy in Sec.4.1 looks ad-hoc to me:\n- The sampling weight of each contry is determine by the weighted sum of it's population and land area. How the final weight (population * 0.3 + area * 0.7) determined? As it listed as one of the main contribution, I expect more insights. Perhaps an analysis of the accuracy on different contries by varying the weighting can show some support for the goal of the sampling.\n- The sampling weight seems to assume that the scene visual diversity of the contries are linearly propotion to the population and land area. Is there any support for this assumption? Perhaps some measure using CLIP distance can provide some insight."
