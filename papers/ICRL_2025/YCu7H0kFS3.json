    "title": "Controlling Large Language Model Agents with Entropic Activation Steering",
    "abstract": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors.",

                "value": "This paper investigates the use of steering activation vector to control the exploration of an LLM agent, represented as a higher degree of uncertainty and resulting in a more diverse high-level action distribution. The computation of steering vector involves estimating the resulting entropy of a prompt and using the entropy as weights to combine diverse latent activations. The resulting steering vector can then be added to the latent activation during inference to control the uncertainty in the LLM agent's thoughts. The proposed technique is evaluated under a simple environments where the agent should choose a better button out of two buttons."

Situations, where this exploratory behaviour would be beneficial, are not clearly defined, especially since uncertainty often correlates with less reliable and potentially unsafe outcomes.  Given this and the known variability of LLM outputs under fixed sampling temperatures, it is difficult to assess the practical value of this work.\n\n- readers may also wonder about real-world applications of more exploratory LLM behaviour, as the paper lacks concrete examples of where such behaviour would be advantageous.\n\n- the two-arm bandit environment used for evaluation limits the depth of exploration observed in the agents. This simple setting raises questions about how well the findings might transfer to environments with high-dimensional action spaces, which might showcase or potentially weaken the support for the authors' claims.\n\n- additional experiments using larger, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in Sections 4.1 and 6.1 could strengthen the study, as SOTA models are likely fine-tuned with more preference data to mitigate overconfidence effectively.\n\n- the study\u2019s generalizability claims are not well-supported by the experimental setup. Minor variations in task prompts are unlikely to yield substantial changes in LLM outputs, making these tests insufficient to support robust claims about generalizability. Expanding the tests to cover more varied task types would strengthen reliability.\n\n- the colour scheme in Figure 1 is slightly confusing; for example, the role of the purple circle is unclear.\n\n\n- missing appendix indexing reduces readability, e.g., lines 180, 375, etc."

Could the authors explain why, in Figure 9, the randomized vector is more resistant to multiplier beta concerning the fraction of valid completions? Also, it would be interesting to include a visualization of the calculated steering vector.\n\n4. Have the authors considered using multiple steering vectors for varied interaction datasets, as a single vector may be insufficient to control LLM behaviour in complex environments? any discussion is appreciated."

The effectivess of proposed method, EAST, has only been validated in simple two-armed bandit problems, despite they are traditional tasks to investgate the exploratory capacity of agents . \nEssentially, two-armed bandit problems are not sequential decision-making tasks. And to demonstrate the effectiveness of EAST in sequential decision-making settings, it is suggested to consider more sophiscated tasks , such as text-based games (e.g., ALFWorld[1]) or robotics/embodied tasks (e.g., Habitat[2]), to test how EAST might handle longer-term dependencies or more complex state spaces in these environments\n2. The layout of Section 6 is not reader-friendly. A different organization of figures would enhance readability.\n3. In Section 6.3, it is demonstrated that EAST can generalize to different prompt variations, however, it is still the same task. How EAST might perform when transferring between tasks with different reward structures or state spaces would be expected.\n\nIf all the concerns can be addressed well, I will consider to raise my score.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Shridhar, M., Yuan, X., C\u00f4t\u00e9, M., Bisk, Y., Trischler, A., & Hausknecht, M.J.
