    "title": "Diagonalizing Affinity Matrix to Identify Clustering Structure",
    "abstract": "Affinity matrix-based clustering constitutes an eminent approach within the domain of data mining. Nevertheless, prior research overlooked the opportunity to directly exploit the block-diagonal structure of the affinity matrix for the purpose of identifying cluster formations. In this paper, we propose an affinity matrix-based clustering strategy, termed as DAM, which employs a traversal algorithm to discern high-density clusters within the graph weighted by the affinity matrix, thereby establishing a traversal sequence. This sequence is subsequently utilized to permute the affinity matrix, thereby revealing its intrinsic block-diagonal structure. Moreover, we introduce an innovative split-and-refine algorithm that autonomously detects all diagonal blocks within the permuted matrix, ensuring theoretical optimality in the presence of well-separated clusters. Extensive evaluations on six real-world benchmark image clustering datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over contemporary state-of-the-art clustering techniques.",

Both the traversal and split-and-refine strategies lack substantial novelty, building primarily on established affinity-based clustering frameworks. This incremental improvement may not meet the expectations of a top-tier conference seeking fundamentally new insights or methodologies in clustering.\n2. Despite claims of computational efficiency, the paper lacks any detailed analysis of DAM's scalability, especially for large datasets. The density-based traversal and iterative refinement are potentially computationally expensive, particularly when dealing with dense affinity matrices. This oversight raises concerns about the practical viability of DAM for large-scale applications. Many anchors based methods have achieved great progress.\n3. The paper primarily compares DAM with older clustering methods (Very few papers in 2024, let alone comparative methods.), bypassing recent advances in deep clustering and self-supervised clustering techniques that have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional and complex datasets. This selective benchmarking weakens the evidence for DAM's claimed superiority and raises questions about its actual competitiveness."

The contribution section mentions that the strategy is \"rapid,\" but no efficiency-related experiments are presented.\n3. Although many comparison algorithms are employed, Table 1 contains numerous missing entries, making the experimental results less convincing.\n4. Since deep clustering incorporates feature representation learning modules, it typically achieves better performance, especially in image applications. However, according to the tables, DAM, as a traditional algorithm, significantly outperforms various deep learning algorithms. It appears that the performance results of comparison algorithms may come from previous papers, with RGB pixels provided directly as features for algorithms like DEC, while DAM uses newly extracted features. If true, the source of performance should be noted, along with details on how the new features were extracted. More rigorously, the input for each algorithm should be standardized.\n5. There is room for improvement in the paper\u2019s writing and organization. For example, Sections 3.1 and 3.2 feel disconnected, making it difficult to understand how the former supports the latter. Additionally, the meanings of $t$, $\\tau$, and $\\mathcal{C}$ are somewhat confusing.\n6. In the experiments, DAM's input relies on the output of BDR-B, which itself learns an approximate block-diagonal structure (not yet permuted). Therefore, I am curious how DAM would perform using Gaussian similarity as input directly, and what the results would be if BDR-B's output were paired with DAM's permutation before applying spectral clustering.\n7. Since a block-diagonal structure is already obtained, directly extracting the connected components of the graph should yield cluster divisions. Hence, what is the purpose or advantage of Section 3.2? Even without permutation, Section 3.2 could still be applied, raising questions about the purpose or advantage of Section 3.1 as well."
