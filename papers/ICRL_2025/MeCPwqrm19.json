    "abstract": "Therapeutic peptides show promise in targeting previously undruggable binding sites, with recent advancements in deep generative models enabling full-atom peptide co-design for specific protein receptors. However, the critical role of molecular surfaces in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has been underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an \\emph{omni-design} peptides generation paradigm, called SurfFlow, a novel surface-based generative algorithm that enables comprehensive co-design of sequence, structure, and surface for peptides. SurfFlow employs a multi-modality conditional flow matching (CFM) architecture to learn distributions of surface geometries and biochemical properties, enhancing peptide binding accuracy. Evaluated on the comprehensive PepMerge benchmark, SurfFlow consistently outperforms full-atom baselines across all metrics. These results highlight the advantages of considering molecular surfaces in \\emph{de novo} peptide discovery and demonstrate the potential of integrating multiple protein modalities for more effective therapeutic peptide discovery.

It proposes to go beyond peptide sequence and structure and additionally model peptide surface and hence introduce an omni-design peptide generative workflow. \n2. The authors perform a full atom conditional flow matching (CFM) for peptide's structure to to learn residues' position, residue identities, backbone torsion, and side chain angles. Concurrently, they perform flow matching to learn peptide surface. The position, normal vector and continious physiochemical properties of surface point cloud are learned through CFM while they utilize discrete flow matching to learn the discrete physiochemical features.\n3. The paper extends its method for further conditioning on cyclicity and disulphite bonds and additionally show results for side-chain packing task."

A few sections (such as Euclidean CFN for postion and physiochemical features susection - more on this to follow) appear to be a straight-foward adaptation of earlier works. Hence, the contributions of this work may be missed by the readers if not explicity pointed out. I had to extensively read through the appendix to appreciate the technical contributions of this work as it was not very evident from the main text. For instance how is the physiochemical features different from Campbell et. al 2024?\n2. L$_{con}$ in eq 17 should be clarified. It is not mentioned explicity in the paper. \n3. Which physiochemical propeties for surface are used should be mentioned in main text or the reference to it in appendix should be provided. \n4. A key consideration of protein generative models are their training and sampling time performance. It would be beneficial to see wall-times of the proposed method and competing state-of-the-art methods. \n5. Since the key contribution is the addition of peptide surface, justifying its usage is critical and to back it up with experimental results on its utility is a must. I couldn't find experiments to ablate all peptide surface component in its entirety and fair comparision to other seq-structure codesign methods. To my understanding, the ablation results in appendix remove 1 sub-component within \"surface design\" component but not the entire \"surface design\" component. \n6. Minor:\n - L59; lock-and-key and induced fit can use references. \n - details of v$^{pos}$, v$^{ori}$, v$^{cat}$ networks should referenced in main text as these annotations are not directly used in the appendix."

If the peptide is considered at its atom level resolution, wouldn't the coordinates, position, identity etc. of the atoms sufficiently characterize the peptide surface?\n And as an extension, in appendix C, authors mention 'full-atom' CFN of 'residues'. The full atom specifications seem to be misleading.\n - On the AAR metric, for any given $C^{rec}$, there can be multiple good binding peptides. How does the sequence identity to the ground truth ensures that the most suitable peptide binder is generated? Does the training dataset provide a guarantee on suitability of the binding peptide and the binding strength?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My primary concern is the lack of biological and chemical motivation behind many of the design choices:\n\n* The central novelty of the paper seems to be the consideration of the peptide surface in the generation process. However, the surface of a peptide is determined entirely by its amino acid sequence. Therefore, what is the motivation behind jointly generating both the amino acid sequence and surface shape? It is not possible to modify the surface shape of a peptide beyond what is determined by the amino acid sequence, so what is the purpose of generating a surface if it cannot be used?\n* Similarly to above, the physicochemical properties of the surface are entirely determined by the amino acid sequence. Therefore, why model the amino acid sequence and physicochemical properties separately? Additionally, the surface properties of all amino acids are already known (such as charge, hydrophobicity, etc.), so why generate these properties instead of just using their known values?\n* What is the meaning of the vector orientations on the surface? The \u201csurface\u201d of a peptide is really just an arbitrary boundary determined by electron density, and so there is no such thing as a directionality to the surface. While the authors distinguish between \u201cconcave\u201d and \u201cconvex\u201d parts of the surface, I\u2019m not sure how that is relevant or worth modeling. And again, it is impossible for a biologist to somehow synthesize a peptide with a different surface orientation than what is determined by the amino acid sequence.\n* I disagree that the physicochemical characteristics considered in the paper should be represented with categorical values. Specifically, the authors treat hydrogen bonding as a categorical variable (acceptor/donor/neutral), but I think it would be more suitable to consider hydrogen bonding potential as a continuous variable. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction, and even among hydrogen bond donors there can be different strengths. Therefore, why not consider hydrogen bonding as a continuous variable?\n\nTaken together, it is hard for me to understand why the proposed model achieves superior results compared to models that only consider the sequence. If the authors successfully motivate their design choices from a biochemical viewpoint, I would be happy to raise my score. However, as it stands, it is hard to see how any output of the model besides the amino acid sequence is useful for biologists. Why not just model the amino acid sequence only?"

However, the paper only considers the residue level, so why is the phrase \u201cfull-atom\u201d used?\n* How is the L_con loss calculated?\n* What are the baselines used in Figure 3, what do they mean, and how are they trained?\n* Are all baselines trained on the same dataset? If so, why is it stated that RFDiffusion is trained on the PDB? If not, how is the comparison fair?"

A time comparison with methods like RFDiffusion, which doesn't require such CPU-intensive workloads, would better illustrate the trade-offs.\n\n## Surface Consistency Concerns\n1. The model seems to generate surface positions and corresponding physico-chemical features simultaneously. While structure consistency is considered in the metrics, it's unclear how the generated surface of generated protein-peptide structures is similar with the calculated surface of the generated protein-peptide structures.\n2. If significant discrepancies exist, the necessity of surface generation in the model should be justified.\n\n## Limited Ablation Study\n1. The purpose of the ablation study (whether it focuses on generation loss or input features) is not clearly specified.\n2. If the impact of surface generation is minimal, the primary contribution of this research may be limited to the addition of surface features.\n\n## Recovery vs Stability\n1. Because surface is mostly determined the functional groups, sequence recovery would be higher and corresponding geometric metrics would be also increased. Beside geometric features, the model is not pretty strong compared to RFDiffusion, also, unstable peptides are useless because peptides are already unstable, so, lower stability arises the questions of use on real world discovery."
