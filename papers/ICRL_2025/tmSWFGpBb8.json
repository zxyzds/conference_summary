    "title": "Learning the Complexity of Weakly Noisy Quantum States",
    "abstract": "Quantifying the complexity of quantum states is a longstanding key problem in various subfields of science, ranging from quantum computing to the black-hole theory. The lower bound on quantum pure state complexity has been shown to grow linearly with system size [J. Haferkamp et al., Nature Physics, 1-5, 2022]. However, extending this result to noisy circuit environments, which better reflect real quantum devices, remains an open challenge. In this paper, we explore the complexity of weakly noisy quantum states. We present an efficient learning algorithm that leverages the classical shadow representation of target quantum states, providing optimal sample complexity with polynomial classical processing time. Our result builds a bridge between learning algorithm and quantum state complexity, meanwhile highlighting the power of learning algorithm in characterizing intrinsic properties of quantum states.",

                "value": "- It is well known in quantum complexity theory that the circuit complexity of a quantum state cannot be efficiently learned [1, 2, 3]. For example, the existence of pseudorandom states that can be generated in polylog depth on 1D circuits [3] immediately implies that no polynomial-time quantum algorithm can distinguish between polylog circuit complexity (complexity defined in terms minimum circuit depth) and exponential circuit complexity. Hence, it is not possible to predict complexity of a state in polynomial processing time without first solving quantumly hard cryptographic problems. I find it very confusing that the authors claim to predict circuit complexity in polynomial time.\n\n- Despite the focus of practical importance (the presence of noise), the paper did not provide any numerical experiments to validate the theoretical claims (including both efficient sample and computational complexity). I think it is important for this work to have supporting numerical experiments for system size that scales to 50-100 qubits.\n\n- While the paper focuses on weakly noisy states, it's unclear how the approach would scale to more general noise models or stronger noise regimes. I think the work did not provide enough justification for the focus on weakly noisy states.\n\n[1] \"Pseudorandom quantum states.\" Advances in Cryptology\u2013CRYPTO 2018.\n[2] \"Quantum pseudoentanglement.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.00747 (2022).\n[3] \"Random unitaries in extremely low depth.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.07754 (2024)."
