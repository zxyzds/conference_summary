    "title": "E(3)-equivariant models cannot learn chirality: Field-based molecular generation",
    "abstract": "Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.",

The authors first provide a theoretical motivation, illustrating why E(3)-invariant features are inadequate for representing chirality. They then propose using fields to model molecular graphs, learning these fields through a reverse diffusion process. The effectiveness of their approach is benchmarked on the QM9 and Geom datasets."

I appreciate the authors\u2019 approach of representing molecules as collections of fields corresponding to atoms and bonds. These fields, as probability densities, closely mirror the quantum mechanics formalism than point clouds, where molecules are wavefunctions. This aligns with methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT), which models charge density and provides a more expressive representation than point clouds. However, the impact on memory overhead from this approach warrants further investigation. Overall, I found this paper to be well-written, clearly delineating previous work, the contributions of this study, and its limitations."

As the author mentioned chirality in amino acids, will be a bottleneck for implementing the model in bio- and pharma-tasks. The current implementation requires high-resolution grids to maintain accuracy, leading to significant memory requirements. Another limitation is the analysis of field parameter sensitivity (\u03c3, \u03b3) is not very clear."

How might this approach be extended to other molecular properties beyond chirality? \n5. Since chirality is a crucial property of molecules that are involved in drug discovery, is there any specific case that the author can provide on the FMG? Other than that, some properties that are not related to the chirality of the molecule (i.e. orbital energies), why FMG outperforms?\n6.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Overstated Claims of State-of-the-Art Performance: Although the paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, it falls significantly behind previously published models such as JODO, EQGAT-Diff, and the more recent Semla-Flow\u2014all of which were published before ICLR 2025. The performance gap is quite substantial. For larger and more realistic molecules in the GEOM Drugs dataset, only 16% have all valid atoms according to the paper's model, whereas other models are approaching perfect scores on these metrics.\n\n2. Equivariance Requirement Not Essential for High Performance: Some models that operate directly in E(3) space are eliminating the need for equivariance. For instance, Simplified Scalable Conformer Generation (MCF) demonstrates significant performance improvements in conformer generation without the requirement for equivariance. While MCF tackles a slightly different task, it illustrates that we can develop equivariance-unaware models for molecular modeling that achieve genuine SOTA performance.\n\n3. Incorrect Basis for Neutrality Metrics: The neutrality metrics in the paper are based on inaccurate assertions. Specifically, the statement: \"Atom neutrality is the percentage of atoms with a formal charge of 0, while molecules are neutral if all their atoms are neutral.\" is incorrect. For example, nitromethane has charged oxygen and nitrogen atoms but is an overall neutral molecule. Atoms within a molecule can carry formal charges that balance out, resulting in a neutral molecule despite individual atoms being charged.\n\n4. Inadequate and Incomplete 3D Structure Evaluation: The evaluation of the 3D structures is poor and incomplete. The paper only compares distribution differences for bond lengths, angles, and energies. These benchmarks are difficult to interpret and can be significantly affected by a single outlier result. Depending on the implementation\u2014for example, in MiDi's implementation\u2014one problematic molecule can drastically alter the results. Even with these limitations, the model does not outperform MiDi on these benchmarks.\n\n5. Overstated Importance of Chirality Awareness in the Model: The emphasis on chirality awareness in the model may be overstated. 3D molecule generation serves as a foundational model for structure-based drug design or molecular docking. In these applications, the provided environment (such as a protein or part of a protein) creates asymmetric restrictions on the generated molecule, naturally leading to the production of the appropriate enantiomer. Additionally, in conditional generation, the classifier itself can learn chirality in a simpler way."

Can you add a comparison to one of these models?\n\n2. Since non-equivariant models like MCF achieve high performance, can you check whether it still cannot distinguish chiral conformers?\n\n3. Your neutrality metric seems inaccurate (or at least description) (e.g., nitromethane is neutral despite charged atoms). Can you address this issue?\n\n4.
