    "abstract": "Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for _in-context fine-tuning_ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time.  We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples  at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models as well as other time-series foundation models.  Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.",

                "value": "The paper proposes the concept of in-context fine-tuning for time series forecasting. The approach proposes to leverage an existing autoregressive transformer based foundation model for univariate time series forecasting, and perform a second stage training. The inputs to the model is modified in the second stage training, by appending multiple related time series which are separated by a \"separator token\" which is a learnable embedding. The standard autoregressive MSE loss is applied. 2 rudimentary approaches to obtaining related examples are introduced, which generally involve randomly sampling from related data. The model can then be used at inference time as per how it was trained in the second stage.\n\nThe paper presents several experiments, including an in-domain evaluation on the Monash TSF benchmark, as well as out-of-domain evaluation on some of the Long Sequence Forecasting datasets. The results show that the ICF paradigm produces improved performance, both compared to the base foundation model, as well as standard fine-tuned version of the foundation model."

Typical hyper parameters such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, etc. Were optimizer parameters loaded from the base foundation model checkpoint? What about learning rate scheduler? \n2. More details for fine-tuning per dataset should be provided. Was a best effort made to ensure suitable hyper parameters were used for this fine-tuning?\n3. For the full results table, the baseline of TimesFM-ICF (n=1) should be added for all datasets. Two things we want to see - how much of the improvement is coming from true \"in-context learning\" versus a second stage training (this is partially resolved by the first ablation study), second is we want to see whether this \"in-context fine-tuning\" specialization hurts the vanilla zero-shot ability of the model, or whether it is still competitive.\n4. Table 5 in the appendix seems to show slightly contradictory results from Section 6.4.1 - while it is not a monotonic decreases in MSE, it still shows a general trend of improvement as number of examples increase. Perhaps the wording in Section 6.4.1 should be rephrased.\n5. More analysis could be provided into the different context generation approaches."

The main claim of this paper is that in-context finetuning is better than zero-shot forecasting and dataset-specific finetuning of foundation models. The experiment section lacks a comparison with existing foundation models. Authors have mainly compared with TimesFM but it would be insightful to see how in-context finetuning fairs in comparison to various foundation models. The results on the Monash benchmark can be compared with LLM-based solutions, specifically with Chronos, as the history and the forecast horizon are smaller for these datasets, and ETT datasets can be compared with Moirai.

Separation of Contextual Time-Series Examples: \n   The authors propose using a learnable separator token ( sigma ) to distinguish between in-context time-series examples. While this can theoretically help prevent pattern blending, it lacks clear explanation or empirical evidence on how effectively this separation operates within the transformer layers. Specifically:\n   - Ambiguity in Attention Calculation: It is unclear how the transformer layers use ( sigma ) to separate information from different time-series examples. The mechanism by which the model differentiates patterns before and after ( sigma) is underspecified.\n   - Potential Overlap in Learned Representations: If the transformer layers rely heavily on self-attention without more sophisticated masking or boundary control, representations of each time-series could still overlap, leading to blending across series. This could be especially problematic when handling time-series with similar trends, potentially confusing the model.\n\n2. Attention Mechanism over Non-Homogeneous Data:\n   The model attempts to attend across series with possibly different scales, lengths, or temporal patterns, which introduces challenges:\n   - Lack of Normalization: Each time-series may have different scales, potentially confusing the model without explicit normalization between examples.\n   - Variable-Length Challenges: The methodology does not address how the attention mechanism handles variable lengths ( T_i ) of the in-context examples. Time-series with different patterns or temporal granularity could introduce biases unless carefully aligned.\n   \n3. Positional Encoding and Temporal Order:\n   Although the authors suggest that causal attention in stacked transformers allows the model to \u201cimplicitly\u201d capture positional information without explicit encoding (following Haviv et al., 2022), this assumption may lead to inaccuracies:\n   - Implicit Positional Information: Without positional encodings, the temporal order within each time-series may not be accurately preserved, especially when multiple examples with different temporal ranges are concatenated. This could dilute the temporal structure that is crucial for time-series forecasting.\n   - Temporal Invariance: Assuming the transformer can infer temporal order without encoding could lead to a loss of precise order-dependent relationships, which may reduce model performance on sequences where exact timing is critical."

They initially pre-trained TimesFM in its original form to establish a base checkpoint, then modified the model\u2019s architecture and continued pre-training with in-context examples to develop a new pre-trained foundation model, TimesFM-ICF! \n\n(2) Regarding originality, the paper introduces the concept of in-context fine-tuning specifically adapted for time-series data. While leveraging context in machine learning is not new, the authors skillfully adapt this idea from NLP to address the unique challenges of time-series forecasting. This approach is especially compelling, as it combines established principles from LLMs with the nuances of temporal data, filling a gap in current literature. The authors\u2019 methodology redefines the possibilities for time-series forecasting and opens new research avenues, suggesting that similar examples in time-series data can enhance model performance beyond what traditional methods achieve.\n\n(3) The research quality is evident in the rigorous methodology applied throughout the study. The authors support their claims with extensive empirical evaluations on prominent forecasting benchmarks, showing clear performance improvements over both supervised deep learning methods and existing time-series foundation models. This empirical evidence reinforces the credibility of their approach, and the thorough experimental design\u2014such as careful dataset selection and detailed result analysis\u2014reflects a high standard of quality!\n\n(5) Clarity is another strong point, as the authors clearly communicate their ideas and findings.

Clear language and precise terminology help demystify complex concepts, making the paper accessible even to those less familiar with time-series forecasting. Illustrative examples and figures further aid understanding, showing the practical implications of in-context fine-tuning! \n\n(6) The paper\u2019s significance is substantial. By demonstrating that in-context fine-tuning significantly improves forecasting accuracy, the authors offer insights that could influence both research and practical applications. The findings suggest that this approach could be a game-changer for practitioners, enabling improved forecasting accuracy without the need for extensive task-specific training data. Moreover, the potential applications of in-context learning extend beyond time-series forecasting, expanding the relevance of this research to other domains"

The authors claim their in-context fine-tuning approach outperforms traditional supervised learning and other foundation models. However, it would be helpful if they could further clarify what sets this approach apart, especially concerning few-shot learning techniques commonly applied in language models. In particular, it would be insightful for the authors to explain how their method handles the unique temporal dependencies in time series data, a challenge that typical language model techniques might not address! It would also be useful to compare the approach to well-known techniques, such as those used in [1] and [2]. It could provide a stronger context for understanding the distinctiveness and value of the method within the broader landscape of in-context learning for time series data!\n\n(2) The experimental design would benefit from testing on a wider variety of datasets and forecasting scenarios. Currently, the benchmarks don\u2019t seem to fully reflect the range of time-series data seen in real-world applications. It might help to include datasets that capture different characteristics\u2014like high seasonality, irregular sampling, or multivariate setups\u2014since these are common in practice. For instance, datasets like LOTSA (as used in [4]) show different levels of noise, seasonality, and trend, which would provide a more comprehensive picture of the model\u2019s performance. It would also give insight into how well the model generalizes across different types of time series and adapts to diverse patterns!\n\n(3) To strengthen the paper, I would suggest a more detailed analysis of the criteria used to select in-context examples during inference. The authors mention that using related time series examples improves model performance, but it would be helpful to explain how they determine which examples are \" related \" enough to be effective. An ablation study comparing different selection approaches, such as the use of domain knowledge, could clarify the impact of these choices on model performance and provide useful insights for future applications! \n\n(4) To add balance to the discussion, it would be valuable to include a deeper look at the approach's limitations. Specifically, it could be helpful to examine situations where the method might struggle, such as when it encounters new or unusual time series patterns not represented in the training set or in the in-context examples. I think it would also be beneficial if the authors considered possible strategies for addressing these limitations or outlined some directions for future work. For example, they might explore ways to detect when the model encounters out-of-distribution patterns or consider methods to adapt the model to new data patterns without extensive retraining! \n\n\n[1] Language Models are Few-shot Learners, Brown et al.

As the number of in-context examples increases, so may the computational load, which could affect the model's feasibility for large-scale applications. Insight into how the model manages larger context windows, as well as any diminishing return in performance with an increasing number of examples, would be valuable. This consideration could also connect to the findings from the [1], which investigates context efficiency in LLMs. A comparison with the proposed approach might highlight areas for adaptation or further improvement! \n\n(3) A more comprehensive look at the model's performance across different forecasting horizons would strengthen the evaluation. While the authors mention that the model adapts to various contexts, empirical results on how it performs across short and long-term forecasting horizons would be valuable. This could reveal whether in-context fine-tuning is consistently effective or better suited for specific forecasting tasks! \n\n(4) The authors suggest that their approach rivals traditional fine-tuning on the target domain, but a deeper analysis of the trade-offs between in-context and conventional fine-tuning would be beneficial.

                "value": "1. **Clarity in Defining Relevance**: While the approach is innovative, a clearer definition or practical guidelines for defining *relevance* would strengthen the paper.\n2. **Generalizability Across Architectures**: The paper would benefit from experiments evaluating the method\u2019s performance with different time-series foundation model architectures.\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: The in-context forecasting objective requires multiple examples as context, adding computational overhead. Since Section 6.4.1 suggests that increased context boosts performance, the computational cost could become substantial. A deeper analysis of this trade-off would be beneficial."

Could the authors provide a comparison of the computational demands between `TimesFM (Base)` and `TimesFM-ICF`?"
