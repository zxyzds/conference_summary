    "title": "AssembleFlow: Rigid Flow Matching with Inertial Frames for Molecular Assembly",
    "abstract": "Molecular assembly, where a cluster of rigid molecules aggregated into strongly correlated forms, is fundamental to determining the properties of materials. However, traditional numerical methods for simulating this process are computationally expensive, and existing generative models on material generation overlook the rigidity inherent in molecular structures, leading to unwanted distortions and invalid internal structures in molecules. To address this, we introduce AssembleFlow. AssembleFlow leverages inertial frames to establish reference coordinate systems at the molecular level for tracking the orientation and motion of molecules within the cluster. It further decomposes molecular $\\text{SE}(3)$ transformations into translations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and rotations in $\\text{SO}(3)$, enabling explicit enforcement of both translational and rotational rigidity during each generation step within the flow matching framework. This decomposition also empowers distinct probability paths for each transformation group, effectively allowing for the separate learning of their velocity functions: the former, moving in Euclidean space, uses linear interpolation (LERP), while the latter, evolving in spherical space, employs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) with a closed-form solution. Empirical validation on the benchmarking data COD-Cluster17 shows that AssembleFlow significantly outperforms six competitive deep learning baselines by at least 45\\% in assembly matching scores while maintaining 100\\% molecular integrity. Also, it matches the assembly performance of a widely used domain-specific simulation tool while reducing computational cost by 25-fold.",

                "value": "The authors present the AssembleFlow framework, which continuously matches weakly correlated structures (like liquid water) to their strongly correlated counterparts, such as crystallized forms like ice. They have carefully designed an underlying theory that leverages advances in flow matching methods to address this problem. AssembleFlow learns SE(3) velocities by decomposing them into translations and rotations. Unlike other methods, they use quaternion representations for rotations, which allows for spherical interpolation. The authors also introduced the idea of reparameterization to directly model SE(3) at time T.\n\nThey performed a comprehensive evaluation by comparing results with other models and with PackMol, a standard simulation-based approach well-established in the field. The authors also computed the distribution of DFT energies for both PackMol and AssembleFlow structures. The method is shown to be 25 times faster than PackMol."

                "value": "The novelty in this work is mainly in solving a new application domain, rather than pure machine learning developments. As acknowledged by the authors, flow matching models on $SE(3)^N$ were first developed for assembling rigid residues to design protein backbones, such as FoldFlow [1]. The authors claim that inertial frames are a key innovation over models like FoldFlow, since arbitrary molecules do not have a unique way to assign frames, unlike protein residues. However, if the goal is just to uniquely interconvert between atomic coordinates and frames, this can be achieved by storing a canonical pose for each molecule and applying the Kabsch algorithm [2] to align each molecule in a cluster to the canonical pose, obtaining a rotation matrix for each molecule. This generalizes the proposed inertial frames, which specifically use a canonical pose from applying principal component analysis on the point cloud.\n\nThe selected baselines are a somewhat unfair comparison, as none of them use rigid molecules. A simple baseline to accomplish this could just be sampling thousands of random translations and rotations of rigid molecules, and filtering out structures with collisions. This would help emphasize the contribution of this work as a method for *intelligently* assembling rigid frames, not just exploiting molecular rigidity.\n\nSome details of the molecular assembly task are not clear to me. Since a generative model is being used, are multiple samples inferenced before computing metrics? And is the input uncorrelated structure fixed, or is it randomly sampled on every training iteration?\n\nThe fact that packing matching of AssembleFlow and PackMol are similar in Table 2, but that energy distributions are quite different in Figure 4, suggests that packing matching is not that sensitive of a metric. A more sensitive metric could be RMSD, which should be possible to calculate using the Hungarian algorithm. If multiple polymorphs are possible for the same molecule, RMSD could be aggregated using the \"average minimum RMSD\" and \"coverage\" metrics proposed by Ganea et al. [3] for molecular conformer search.\n\nMinor issues:\n- Figure 8 the lower left box content is not centered\n- Table 2 arrow is wrong for separation\n- Line 176 SO(3) must also have det 1\n- Line 285 \"SPLER\"\n- Line 805 \"dynamcis\"\n\n[1] Bose, A.

This claim appears to overlook prior work [1], which closely aligns with the approach presented here, treating molecules as rigid bodies in molecular assembly, separately handling SO(3) and Euclidean space, and applying quaternion representation on SO(3). The differences are minimal, mainly in the methods for constructing rigid frames and in the choice of a normalizing flow over a CNF with flow matching.\n\nAdditionally, the paper emphasizes the decomposition of SE(3) into $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and SO(3) as a unique strength (e.g., \u201cthis decomposition also empowers distinct probability paths\u2026, effectively allowing for separate learning\u201d). However, decomposing SE(3) into SO(3) and $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a widely adopted simplification in SE(3)-based methods ([1,2] among others). To my knowledge, there are no approaches that directly operate on SE(3) without this decomposition, which raises questions about why this common approach is presented as an innovative strength.\n\nGiven these points, I am hesitant to support this work for acceptance in its current form.\n\n-----\n[1] Rigid Body Flows for Sampling Molecular Crystal Structures, K\u00f6hler et al., ICML 2023  \n[2] SE(3)-Stochastic Flow Matching for Protein Backbone Generation, Bose et al., ICLR 2024"
