    "title": "FDTDNet: Privacy-Preserving Lensless Object Segmentation via Feature Demultiplexing and Task Decoupling",
    "abstract": "Camera-based vision systems pose privacy risks, whereas lensless cameras present a viable alternative by omitting visual semantics from their measurements due to the absence of lenses. However, these captured lensless measurements pose challenges for existing computer vision tasks such as object segmentation that usually require visual input. To address this problem, we propose a lensless object segmentation network via feature demultiplexing and task decoupling (FDTDNet) to perform object segmentation for lensless measurements. Specifically, we propose an optical-aware feature demultiplexing mechanism to get meaningful features from lensless measurements without visual reconstruction and design a multi-task learning framework decoupling the lensless object segmentation task into two subtasks, i.e., the reason for contour distribution maps (CDM) and body distribution maps (BDM), respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FDTDNet achieves highly accurate segmentation effect, which sheds light on privacy-preserving high-level vision with compact lensless cameras.",

                "value": "The paper proposes a model for segmentation that operates on measurements from a lensless camera. Instead of prior approaches that first attempt to reconstruct an RGB image and then carry out segmentation, the paper's approach directly operates on the lensless measurements. The architecture is endowed with knowledge of the optical measurement process through \"optical feature demultiplexing\", along with other innovations. Experimental results confirm the benefits of this approach."

                "value": "- The paper is generally well motivated (except for the question of privacy below) and written. It makes sense that a single unified approach would work better than segmenting reconstructed images.\n- The OFD approach is novel and interesting. It has the potential to be useful beyond the segmentation task as a general way of processing lensless measurements for vision tasks.\n- The experiments and ablations are extensive and largely convincing."

                "value": "- The paper adds an unnecessary \"privacy preserving\" claim (in its title!) that is really only discussed in the (first paragraph of the) introduction, and mostly by citing other papers. Privacy preserving is a strong claim and should not be made without more care. If anything, a paper that shows improved performance at segmentation implies that lensless measurements  carry a fair amount of information about the underlying scene, and could leak private details. A video of segmentation masks could, for example, be enough to identify people by gaits. At that point, we get to deciding what privacy preserving means and what kind of privacy is being preserved.\n\n  But this entire question is un-necessary to the central contribution of the paper --- a better segmentation approach for lensless cameras. The paper would be stronger, and in my opinion more sound, if it dropped the superfluous privacy claim from its title.\n\n- The ODM + CDM approach could be explained a bit better, and especially discussed more with related work. Has this division into subtasks been tried before? How does this relate to CDMNet?\n\n- Minor point, but the paper should make the experimental results section a bit more self contained and describe the content of the two benchmark datasets."

The mathematical presentation, particularly in the OFD mechanism on page 3, lines 162-215 (Equations 3-11), is overly dense and challenging to understand.\n- This section mainly stacks equations without sufficient explanation, making it difficult for readers to grasp the underlying principles. It would be beneficial to include more intuitive or conceptual explanations alongside these equations. \n- Additionally, labeling elements of Figure 2 to indicate which parts correspond to specific equations could greatly improve clarity. Given the length and complexity of this section, I suggest either simplifying the equations or providing clearer explanations.\n\n2) Analysis: \n- The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of its limitations. \n- Although some failure cases are illustrated in Figure 12 on page 16 (Appendix), it would be helpful to place these directly in the main text and discuss potential solutions more explicitly. \n- Discussion about addressing these limitations directly within the main body is suggested.\n- However, this is a minor suggestion. My main concern is the first point about clarity."
