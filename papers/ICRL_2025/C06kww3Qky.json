    "abstract": "The degree-corrected block model (DCBM), latent space model (LSM), and $\\beta$-model are all popular network models. We combine their modeling ideas and propose the logit-DCBM as a new model. Similar as the $\\beta$-model and LSM, the logit-DCBM contains nonlinear factors, where fitting the parameters is a challenging open problem. We resolve this problem by introducing a cancellation trick. We also propose R-SCORE as a recursive community detection algorithm, where in each iteration, we first use the idea above to update our parameter estimation, and then use the results to remove the nonlinear factors in the logit-DCBM so the renormalized model approximately satisfies a low-rank model, just like the DCBM. Our numerical study suggests that R-SCORE significantly improves over existing spectral approaches in many cases. Also, theoretically, we show that  the Hamming error rate of R-SCORE is faster than that of SCORE in a specific sparse region, and is at least as fast outside this region.",

                "value": "The authors first propose the logit-DCBM model as a nonlinear variant of the degree-corrected block model (DCBM), which essentially replaces the log link function with the logit link function. Replacing the link from log brings some nice properties to the model, such as removing some constraints on latent parameters. However, at the cost of introducing non-linearity and the parameter estimation becomes difficult.\n\nThe main technique is the cancellation trick, used to estimate nonlinear terms in the logit-DCBM, which simplifies parameter estimation and the authors claim that this addresses an open problem in the $\\beta$-model parameter estimation (another one community variant which is the special case of their logit-DCBM). Additionally, the paper introduces R-SCORE for community detection, a recursive adaptation of the SCORE algorithm for the logit-DCBM. Finally, they derive upper bounds on the classification error rates for SCORE and R-SCORE for their proposed model logit-DCBM."

References?\nLine 59-60: I don't think the logistic regression is the only \"recommended\" model by text bool for binary data. Also, what does \"recommending\" even mean? Where does Hastie et al. 2009 recommend it?\n\nSee also questions. Questions 1 and 2 in particular, where I further raised my concern.\n\nIt is perhaps interesting to study logit-DCBM, but it is not clear to me right now based on what is written on the paper, and that's why I am currently leaning towards a borderline reject."

Or just to come up with an estimate? Or to come up with an estimate that satisfies certain properties? What is the precise technical open question?\n2. What properties does your estimate have? As far as I can think, it is not unbiased, or is it? Is it consistent? What can you say further? For me, right now, it is just some estimate.\n3. Ultimately, I really want to get a better understanding of Lemma 3 and how good this estimate is. I understood the statement and algebra used therein. But is there something more interesting? What is the effect of $m$ on the quality of the estimate? Does it not change anything in terms of quality? Or even if it does, we are looking at the statistics for $m=3$ for computational efficiency? Also, is there an intuitive way of thinking about what that statistics is capturing in (10) and its equivalent for higher $m$? And why I can expect it to be a reasonable estimate? Essentially, trying to get intuition on why cancellation happens. \n4. Does the cancellation trick also apply to other link functions beyond logit? In either yes or no, could you please walk me through why for some standard link functions (e.g. probit or other relevant ones)? \n\nTypos:\n-In Lemma 2.1 Proof, is there an extra summation over $i$ again in $(I)$?\n-In Line (222): \",the sum is over..\",the index $i_2$ is repeated twice."
