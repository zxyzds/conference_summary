    "title": "DO GENERATIVE MODELS LEARN RARE GENERATIVE FACTORS?",
    "abstract": "Generative models are becoming a promising tool in AI alongside discriminative learning. Several models have been proposed to learn in an unsupervised fashion the corresponding generative factors, namely the latent variables critical for capturing the full spectrum of data variability. Diffusion Models (DMs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are of particular interest due to their impressive ability to generate highly realistic data. Through a systematic empirical study, this paper delves into the intricate challenge of how DMs, GANs and VAEs internalize and replicate rare generative factors. Our findings reveal a pronounced tendency towards the memorization of these factors. We study the reasons for this memorization and demonstrate that strategies such as spectral decoupling can mitigate this issue to a certain extent.",

                "value": "Relation to disentanglement and causality literature missing: This is my main criticism of this work. The problem that it tackles is very well-known in deep generative modeling. DGMs are known to take `shortcuts` instead of learning the causal generative mechanism if the problem is not well constrained. A rich body of work on learning disentangled representation in VAEs and GANs tackles practically the same issue. More recently, there are works at the intersection of causality and disentanglement in DGMs, for example [1]. The current work, as presented does not relate back to these works or clarifies if and how its findings are different or complimentary to the domain of disentangled and/or causal DGMs.  \n\n[1] Zhang, J., Greenewald, K., Squires, C., Srivastava, A., Shanmugam, K., & Uhler, C. (2024). Identifiability guarantees for causal disentanglement from soft interventions. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36.\n\nExperimental Setup and Memorization: I am not sure if memorization is the cause behind the observation. In the current experimental setup, the DGMs seem to learn exactly what the training data distribution implies. Unless there are additional constraints (disentanglement, causal or SD) there is no reason for the DGM to necessarily learn the causal mechanism. This is known as the `shortcut problem` but it is not a form of memorization."

In the introduction section, it is only mentioned that the purpose of this paper is to examine whether generative models can derive rare generative factors, but a clear motivation is lacking. For example, what is the purpose of deriving rare generative factors? What negative impacts might arise if rare generative factors are not effectively learned?\n2.\tGenerative models typically learn latent representations automatically, however, this paper manually defines Generative Factors, and all experiments are based on these predefined factors. This approach may create a discrepancy with the stated objective in line 92: \u201cOur work provides valuable insights into the limitations of current generative models in learning robust, transferable representations from imbalanced datasets, opening new avenues for improving their generalization capabilities.\u201d\n3.\tThe experiments are not consistent with the examples. In these examples, the rare factor has a strong relationship with the label. However, in the dataset D_u, the numbers of samples with two rare factors are the same. From my point of view, it is more like an imbalanced classification problem, while the authors experiments did not take it into account. \n4.\tp>0.05 only means that one cannot reject the null hypothesis, and is not strong evidence that the model has effectively learned the model. \n5.\tThe paper lacks a detailed explanation of how Spectral Decoupling mitigates this memorization tendency\n6.\tSome parts of the paper are verbose and convoluted, making it difficult to understand."

                "value": "The paper answers the question of whether generative models learn rare generative factors (RGFs), which are latent variables whose frequency is highly skewed in the real world but play an important role in the generative process. The ability to capture RGFs is crucial for many real world tasks e.g. successfully diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in younger patients.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the authors train and test three different generative models, namely a generative adversarial network (GAN), a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a diffusion model (DM) on two different types of datasets. One dataset has the generative factor uniformly distributed across all training instances, and the second dataset has the RGF concentrated to a singular class to simulate the most extreme case of RGFs. Classifiers are trained to discern the RGFs from samples generated by the learned models, and a statistical test is applied to determine whether the generative models have successfully learned the RGF, or instead memorized it.\n\nThe results show that generative models are capable of learning RGFs, but GANs and DMs are particularly biased towards memorization than VAEs, highlighting the nuances in how various generative models approach learning of RGFs. The authors then attempt to understand and potentially mitigate RGF memorization in GANs, noting that GANs have the greatest tendency for memorization possibly due to the adversarial discriminator. The authors suggest that the discriminator learns a spurious correlation between the RGF and the training instance, which the authors note is reminiscent of the \"gradient starvation\" phenomenon. To that end, the authors train a GAN using spectral decoupling, which prevents gradient starvation, and notice that it mitigates RGF memorization to a certain degree."

More specifically, generative models have difficulty capturing all the modes of the data distribution while also assigning high probability to areas of low probability in the distribution's manifold [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nAdditionally, this topic has been explored in several other papers, with [5] in particular coming to similar conclusions of GANs assigning spurious correlations between generative factors, albeit from a different motivation. In a similar vein, the explanation for why GANs failed in particular were mainly empirical and post-hoc in nature, which I believe makes the results rather weak.\n\nReferences\n[1] Danilo Jimenez Rezende and Shakir Mohamed.

In a \"dumb\" Gaussian latent VAE, the posterior may fail to assign probability to certain low-probability areas in the latent manifold, preventing VAEs from generating rare-but-valid combinations of data. It may also help if the authors could train a VAE with normalizing flows (see [1] in \"Weaknesses\") to see if the RGF memorization problem is mitigated further, putting theory into practice.\n\nWithout needing to go too in depth, a basic explanation of the models' respective objectives and how they relate specifically to learning of RGFs will greatly improve the meaningfulness of the contributions, and by extension the novelty."
