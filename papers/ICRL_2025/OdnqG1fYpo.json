    "title": "Moner: Motion Correction in Undersampled Radial MRI with Unsupervised Neural Representation",
    "abstract": "Motion correction (MoCo) in radial MRI is a particularly challenging problem due to the unpredictability of subject movement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MoCo algorithms often rely on extensive high-quality MR images to pre-train neural networks, which constrains the solution space and leads to outstanding image reconstruction results. However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly reconstructs artifact-free MR images and estimates accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring any training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, facilitating optimal solutions. Specifically, we integrate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI reconstruction as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.

                "value": "The present work poses some major and minor weaknesses:\nMajor:\n- The evaluation is exclusively conducted on simulated motion-corrupted data, which raises the question of its actual applciability in real settings. Particularly considering that motion artefacts not only arise from the physical movement, but also from resulting field inhomogenieties, etc., the simulation procedure might be too simplified and the model is likely to simply adapt to these parameters. If the work is aimed at MR motion-correction methods within a clinical workflow, testing the method on in-vivo data is mandatory.\n- In this work, it is claimed multiple times, that the Fourier slice theorem is a crucial part of their work and this works novelty. Yet, the Fourier slice theorem was already introduced a while ago (Catalan 2023 et al,  \t\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.14363) and used in several works after. While it is definitely aiding the method, it should be cited and not included as novelty. \n- Within the results, \"significant improvement\" (l., 365/l.431) is often claimed, the standard deviation (e.g. in table 2) and statistical tests should be reported to support this statement. Similarly for the improvement claim regarding Table 4: Statistical testing would be helpful, since the standard deviation reported opens up questions the actual improvement\n\nMinor:\n- For full reproducibility, it would be nice to mention all post-processing steps conducted before quantitative evaluation (nect to registration mentioned in A1, e.g. if normalization was conducted, etc.?)\n- There are several typos which can be corrected (line326, 504,...)"

                "value": "- For the motion simulation, are all spokes corrupted by motion? Or how many spokes are chosen to be affected? Realistic motion patterns in brain would be individual lines, but this is not specified. Can you generally provide more details on the motion simulation, e.g. was only the physical movement considered / what motion patterns were the inspiration for this simulation / were any secondary motion effects considered? \n- In line 151 it is mentioned, that the methods overlook the high dynamic range problem, yet it is considered in some of the mentioned works (e.g. Huang 2023)?\n- The low-frequency bias mentioned in the introduction (l.182) is highly dependent on the network settings (activation function, etc.), yet this is not mentioned in the implementation details? \n- I would suggest to add significance testing to support the result claims within the text.\n- In general, while the simulation evaluation is nice for a proof-of-concept, the models performance on real-world data would be very useful to evaluate its actual capabilities and highly recommended for any future work."

Readers would be interested in how good the proposed method is on MRI images of different contrasts or taken at different body parts. Specifically, will the optimization still converge stably with the same optimization strategy (e.g. hash encoding) and hyperparameter choice? In addition, how does noise level affect the optimization process?\n- How will trans-plane motion affect the stability of optimization?\n- In Fig. 8, I notice that the reconstructed image looks blurry and lacks some thin structures like vessels. In other figures, images are too small to observe such details. I suggest authors show zoomed-in images from both baselines and proposed method for better comparison.\n- Authors may want to report FOV and pixel spacing to let readers get a sense of the magnitude of motion ranges used in this paper.\n- It is surprising to see that a supervised method (DRN-DCMB) is worse than an unsupervised method. In Fig. 4, DRN-DCMB results look very blurry, making me doubt if it is the SOTA supervised method. Authors may consider alternative baselines such as [1].\n\n[1] Singh NM, Iglesias JE, Adalsteinsson E, Dalca AV, Golland P.

Are the 25 slices the entire slices from e.g. two subjects or are they 25 mid-slices from 25 subjects? The fastMRI dataset is very diverse. Are the subjects for training and testing taken from the same contrasts, e.g., T2 weighted or FLAIR? What is the main difference of the MoDL dataset to the data used from the fastMRI dataset? This information is important to assess the severity of the distribution shift. From Figure 4 it seems that the main difference is the view being axial and coronal respectively. Are there any other differences?\n3. The comparison of the computational speed would benefit from a more detailed discussion. Where do the differences in terms of speed come from? How can the TV method with 200 epochs be slower than the INR with 4000 epochs?
