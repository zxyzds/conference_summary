    "title": "MoreauPruner: Robust Structured Pruning of Large Language Models against Weight Perturbations",
    "abstract": "In the existing model pruning literature, the weight gradient has been extensively utilized to measure the importance of weight, where the gradient is well-known to be sensitive to perturbations. On the other hand, the widely used large language models (LLMs) have several billion model parameters, which could increase the fragility of few-shot gradient pruning. In this work, we experimentally show that one-shot gradient pruning algorithms could lead to unstable results under perturbations to model weights. Even the minor error of switching between data formats bfloat16 and float16 could result in obviously different outcomes. To address such instabilities, we leverage optimization analysis and propose an LLM structural pruning method, called MoreauPruner, with provable robustness against weight perturbations. In MoreauPruner, the model weight importance is estimated based on the neural network's Moreau envelope, which can be flexibly combined with $\\ell_1$-norm regularization techniques to induce the sparsity required in the pruning task. We extensively evaluate the MoreauPruner algorithm on several well-known LLMs, including LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA3-8B, and Vicuna-7B. Our numerical results suggest the robustness of MoreauPruner against weight perturbation and how robust importance estimation in MoreauPruner contributes to successful accuracy-based scores compared to several existing pruning methods.",

The experiments focus on relatively small LLMs (~7B parameters). In today\u2019s landscape, where models often exceed 70B parameters, it would be more impactful to evaluate MoreauPruner on larger-scale LLMs to demonstrate its utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n\n3. While the authors justify the importance of robustness to weight perturbations in cases like bfloat16 and float16 transitions, this seems limited to niche scenarios. The need for such robustness in broader practical settings remains unconvincing, despite the improvements shown in performance. Expanding on why this aspect is critical for widespread application would strengthen the paper.\n\n[1] Zhang, Jingwei, and Farzan Farnia. \"Moreaugrad: Sparse and robust interpretation of neural networks via moreau envelope.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023."

The target LLM is pruned using this score, and then fine-tuned with LoRA to recover the performance.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The central weakness of this paper is the unclear motivation. In particular, I am even not sure why the inconsistency of the pruning outcomes up to small perturbation is problematic. There can be many different but equally good pruning masks for a neural network. Indeed, the classic structured pruning work by Srinivas and Babu (2015) proposes to remove either neuron A or neuron B (but not both) whenever two neurons are highly similar to each other, as they are considered redundant. Here, we should be indifferent to the choice whether we remove neuron A or neuron B; both gives us a reasonable good choice. If the authors believe that there should be a unique choice of pruning masks, I recommend giving more supporting evidences, e.g., empirical backups.\n\n- Also, it is not clear to me why the results in Table 1 is meaningful. If I understood correctly, it seems like the authors are trying to prove that MoreauPruner a more robust performance on both BF16 and FP16. Here, I am not sure why the \"Diff\" matters. Perhaps the fact that MoreauPruner achieves smaller perplexity on both cases is what is meaningful, and having a small \"diff\" may not really have much implications, as working bad on both numeric types can result in small diff as well. Also, I am curious why MoreauPruner seems to consistently work poorer than LLM-Pruner for 5% pruning ratio.\n\n- The performance gain over LLM-Pruner is not very dramatic, which I believe is perhaps linked to the unclear motivation.\n\n- The set of target models is somewhat restricted, as they are constrained to LLaMA family, except for Vicuna-7B. I recommend adding (at least two) experiments on other options, such as Mistral, Qwen, OPT, or BLOOM.\n\n- I am not sure if I missed, but it would be great if authors could make any remarks on the computational costs of obtaining the pruning masks, such as required memory and computations.\n\n- The quality of writing can be improved. For instance, the paper uses the terminology \"structural pruning,\" which I believe should be replaced with much more popular term \"structured pruning\" (I am aware that the term \"structural pruning\" has been used in some recent works, but I think they are mostly mistakes). Also, \"anti-intuitive\" can be replaced by \"counterintuitive.\" The phrase \"robustness pruning result\" in L77 is weird. In L165, \"easy obtained\" should be \"easily obtained.\" In L181, \"effiently\" should be \"efficiently.\" In L230, \"envelop\" should be \"envelope,\" as in all other usages. In figure 4 caption, \"hyper-paramter\" is wrong. There should be much more errors; please locate them and fix them all."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- A mild suggestion is to draw motivation for perturbation robustness from other sources of weight perturbation. For example, here are some half-baked thoughts: (1) Pruning itself perturbs the weights; that is, pruning some weights may affect gradient evaluations for other weights. (2) Further re-training with LoRA may also be the source of expected weight perturbation; the proposed method can be viewed as being ready for such updates."
