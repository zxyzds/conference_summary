    "title": "FEDNET: FREQUENCY ENHANCED DECOMPOSED NETWORK FOR OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION TIME SERIES CLASSIFICATION",
    "abstract": "Time series classification is a crucial task with widespread applications in vari\u0002ous fields such as medicine and energy. Due to the non-stationary property of time series, its data distribution will change over time, which makes it challenging for models to generalize to the out-of-distribution (OOD) environment. How\u0002ever, limitations persist in the current research on OOD time series classification, particularly the absence of a unified consideration addressing both domain dis\u0002tribution shift and temporal distribution shift. To this end, we view the time series distribution shift from the frequency perspective and propose a novel method called Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Network (FEDNet) for OOD time series classification. FEDNet utilizes frequency domain information to guide the decomposition of time series and further eliminates domain shift and temporal shift, it then obtains domain-invariant features for adapting to OOD data. Finally,we provide theoretical insights of FEDNet to validate its superiority for OOD time series classification. Comprehensive results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FEDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD time series classification tasks, surpassing previous methods by up to 7%.",

                "value": "- The authors claimed that traditional IRM-based domain generalization methods are \"not applicable\" to time series data. I find this statement inaccurate. They could be applicable but suboptimal.\n\n\n- The definition of temporal distribution shift (def 3) is unclear. It is not clear why or how different temporal positions in the raw data imply different distributions. It is quite normal the timesteps are different. It should rather be on the temporal segment level.\n- Also, definition 4 introduces the connection between temporal shifts and frequency shifts, but the reason why temporal shifts inherently lead to frequency shifts is not clear for me. \n\n- Wold\u2019s Theorem is the basis for separating deterministic and stochastic components, but the connection to FEDNet is weakly established. The decomposition itself is mentioned without context on why Wold\u2019s Theorem specifically supports this approach for OOD time series classification.\n\n- Also, using Hilbert space and Bochner\u2019s theorem is poorly integrated. The authors mentioned that \"we can transform such data into a Hilbert space\" without explaining why this transformation is needed or how it benefits the model. If Bochner\u2019s theorem and Hilbert space are central to the method, they need more justification and background.\n\n- There are some issues with the usage of notations. For example, in Equation 3, terms like \u03c9\u03bb and \u03bb-th frequency component are introduced without any definition, and their role in the decomposition is unclear. Similarly, the notation for masking (Mask [S_\u03b1]) lacks detail.\n- Also, \u03bb is reused again in Eq. 13 as a hyperparameter, causing an inconsistency issue.\n- I find that variational inference to disentangle domain-invariant and domain-specific features in the time-deterministic block is ok. However, the explanation lacks clarity on how this disentanglement process specifically aids in handling domain distribution shifts in OOD classification. \n- In Proposition 4.1, it is not clear how frequency decomposition leads to time-deterministic and time-stochastic components that address OOD challenges.\n\n- It would be great if the authors could study the impact of frequency filter masking levels to assess the impact of different frequency filtering thresholds and the masking operation in isolating stable (time-deterministic) components.\n\n- The authors observe that the coefficient of variation is lower for time-deterministic components than for time-stochastic components. However, they do not discuss the implications of this finding in enough depth.\n\n- The authors state that removing the time-stochastic block has only a \"small effect\" on performance (which is also clear from the ablation study). Does this mean that this component is less crucial and adds extra unnecessary computations?\n\n- Page 3, sentences 109 to 112 are not clear.\n- The authors have an issue with the named citation, which causes a readability issue. Note that ICLR template has several ways of citations. Check the difference in the output of these two statements.\n     - Domain Generalization \\cite{wang} is a difficult \u2026 -->  Domain Generalization (Wang et al. 2022a) is a difficult \u2026\n     - \\citep{athor_x} mentioned that DG is a difficult \u2026 --> Wang et al. (2024) mentioned that DG is a difficult \u2026\n\nUse the first when you want just to cite. Use the second when you want to include the author's name in the text."

The benefits of approaching the distribution shift from the frequency view are unclear. In addition, the paper argues that the temporal distribution shift is influenced by the window division. However, to the reviewer, increasing the window size might help mitigate this shift, as it could provide a more stable representation of the data over time.\n  \n* The paper provides two schemes for constraint loss, but no experiments are designed to compare them. The proposed method also involves multiple different loss functions, it is not clear how to balance them in the model optimization.\n\n* The baseline method ERM algorithm actually demonstrates a very competitive performance, which further weakens the motivation of the paper. The adopted datasets in the experiments lack diversity since they only include the human activity datasets.\n\n* In the time-stochastic block, a two-layer transformer encoder is used with a patch length of 16 and a hidden size of 512. However, as shown in Figure 4, such a complex module only brings limited performance gains, which questions the necessity of such complexity. Besides, the symbols are not clearly defined, such as $x_p$ in Eq. 11 and there are also labeling errors in Table 4."

These two cannot be directly compared.\n\nW2-2. It would be very useful if the authors can briefly summarize the impact of Proposition 4.1 in the beginning of Section 5.4.
