    "title": "Unposed Sparse Views Room Layout Reconstruction in the Age of Pretrain Model",
    "abstract": "Multiple-perspective images room layout reconstruction is poorly investigated due to the tedious and cumbersome steps that emerge from multi-view geometry, e.g camera intrinsic/extrinsic estimation, image matching, and triangulation. However, with the advancement of the current 3D foundation model DUSt3R, a paradigm shift has occurred in the 3D reconstruction realm, moving from a multi-step Structure-from-motion approach to an end-to-end single-step reconstruction without error accumulation and instability.\nTo this end, this paper employs the 3D foundation model DUSt3R in the room layout reconstruction task, naming it \\ours{}. As the name suggests, \\ours{} incorporates the DUSt3R framework and plane representation, then fine-tunes on a room layout dataset (Structure3D). With the uniform and parsimonious results of \\ours{}, we can obtain the final room layout with only a single post-processing step and 2D detection results. Compared to previous room layout reconstruction methods, it relaxes the setting from a single perspective/panorama image to multiple perspective images. Moreover, \\ours{} solves the task in an end-to-end paradigm without cumbersome steps and accumulated errors. Finally, experiments show that our \\ours{} not only surpasses the state-of-the-art on the synthesis dataset Structure3D but also demonstrates the robustness and performs well in real-world cases.",

While availability of real multi-view layout dataset is scarse, there exists many multi-view 3D datasets (such as ScanNet, ARKit Scene) etc. These datasets have ground-truth depth maps and camera poses that can be used for pseudo ground-truth generation and the proposed method can be compared against other layout reconstruction methods on such dataset. Authors do provide qualitative results on some real-world data, but it is not enough to assess accuracy of method on the real data. If authors can show effectiveness of the method on real data this method can be promising.\n\nSecond, I am not convinced as to why PlaneDust3R is needed. If authors take regular Dust3R and use off-the-shelf semantic segmentation to segment walls, floors, and ceilings and use only those points to generate layout (by combining this with NonCuboids + f3 post-processing proposed in the paper), that might also be enough. Retraining method only on synthetic dataset such as Structure3D might reduce their accuracy on the real-world dataset."

I would suggest authors to keep results for only structure 3D.\n\n3D precision and recall should be reported at different threshold. I think 15deg threshold is pretty high. Maybe authors should show results at 5deg, 15deg, and 30deg angular thresholds, and similar translation thresholds. This will give more comprehensive view of the methods performance."

It's reasonable that DUSt3R and MASt3R perform worse as they didn't trained on the synthetic Structured3D dataset. What about the generalized performance of the proposed Plane-DUSt3R on the other real-world dataset?\n\n- It's a pity that the proposed Plane-DUSt3R is only trained and mainly evaluated on the synthetic Structured3D dataset. There are many existing resource with multiview and room layout annotation on the 360 panorama domain, e.g., ZInD[1] has multiview layout on unfurnished rooms, MP3DLayout[2] has single-view layout annotation but the source Matterport3D also offer nearby views. Gather more data by projecting these 360 to perspective can make this work much stronger.\n  - [1] Zillow Indoor Dataset: Annotated Floor Plans With 360\u00ba Panoramas and 3D Room Layouts\n  - [2] Manhattan Room Layout Reconstruction from a Single 360\u00b0 image: A Comparative Study of State-of-the-art Methods\n\n- The qualitative comparison in Fig.6 and Fig.8 is unfair to the baseline. In the fourth column, the baseline \"Noncuboid+MASt3R\" is presented without texture. We can then easily spot one big issue that some of the walls are duplicated and misaligned. However, in the final column, the layout wireframe from the proposed method is hiding by the rgb point cloud, making it difficult to judge if the similar issue happend to the proposed method as well.\n\n- Too few qualitative results. On the in-domain Structured3D dataset, only two are provided in Fig.6. The additional three in supp's Fig.9 also has two duplicated scenes from Fig.6. In application of room tour and room demo, the final visual outcome is what we really care about while the improvement on number is sometimes hard to interpret how it affect the final visual. In addition, some more visualization, espeically on the failure cases, may can provide some hint for future work to further improve."
