    "abstract": "We consider the decentralized minimization of a separable objective $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i)$, where the variables are coupled through an affine constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\mathbf{A}_i x_i - b_i\\right) = 0$.\nWe assume that the functions $f_i$, matrices $\\mathbf{A}_i$, and vectors $b_i$ are stored locally by the nodes of a computational network, and that the functions $f_i$ are smooth and strongly convex. \n\nThis problem has significant applications in resource allocation and systems control and can also arise in distributed machine learning.\nWe propose lower complexity bounds for decentralized optimization problems with coupled constraints and a first-order algorithm achieving the lower bounds. To the best of our knowledge, our method is also the first linearly convergent first-order decentralized algorithm for problems with general affine coupled constraints.",

The core idea for constructing the optimal algorithm draws heavily from the APAPC algorithm (Salim et al. 2022a) and Chebyshev acceleration, a common technique in accelerated algorithms for unconstrained decentralized optimization. The authors combine these two techniques to create the proposed algorithm.\n\n2. Another concern is the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm. While it achieves theoretical optimality, it is significantly more complex to implement than existing baselines. As shown in Algorithms 2-5, the proposed algorithm consists of multiple algorithmic blocks and introduces numerous hyperparameters\u2014such as \u03c1, \u03bd, \u03b4, and p\u2014that require tuning. These factors collectively detract from its practical value.\n\n3. The numerical experiments are too trivial."

                "value": "1. As noted in the introduction, unconstrained consensus optimization is a special case of problem (1). For this special case, can the complexity of Algorithm 2 be reduced to match the optimal complexity of the unconstrained consensus algorithm in (Scaman et al., 2017)?\n\n2. In the simulation section, how do you tune the hyperparameters?\n\n3. The simulation results appear somewhat limited. It is difficult to observe whether the complexity scales proportionally with $\\sqrt{\\kappa_f}$, $\\sqrt{\\kappa_A}$, and $\\sqrt{\\kappa_W}$, as established by Theorem 1. It would be beneficial to empirically validate the complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly with respect to $\\kappa_f$, $\\kappa_A$, and $\\kappa_W$.\n\n4. It is recommended to evaluate the algorithm using more real-world datasets and more complex experiments, such as logistic regression."

The lower bounds is only applicable to a narrow class of algorithms represented by the proposed algorithm. There are other class of algorithms which could have been discussed.\n\nThe proposed algorithm uses a multi-communication algorithm in a dual-loop approach, where a subproblem must be solved with communication. Although the process is accelerated such that it is optimal, there exist studies in the decentralized consensus literature that utilize tools such as gradient tracking, ADMM, etc., and prove convergence with single-loop algorithms. This is also preferable in practice since the communication bottleneck is more apparent for modern optimization tasks. \n\nA more complex experiment with real data and even neural networks would be appreciated for VFL.

This general formulation encompasses different applications, from energy networks to vertical (model-partitioned) federated learning. A complexity lower bound is given for this problem, as well as a matching (and thus optimal) algorithm. Both the algorithm and the lower bound are obtained through a reduction to the standard decentralized case, which is usually solved by introducing coupled constraints (the parameters from different nodes should be equal), and solving the constrained problem with a (primal-)dual approach. As such, the algorithm is based on APAPC (Salim et. al., 2022), and the lower bound directly proceeds from standard lower bounds. Adding extra coupling constraints is extremely natural in this case, and it is not surprising that using the same approach as for decentralized unconstrained optimization leads to similar results. The only care should be taken in how these extra constraints are added to ensure that the right quantities are communicated. Experiments demonstrate the (expected) superiority of the approach."
