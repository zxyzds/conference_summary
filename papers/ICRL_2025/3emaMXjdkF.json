    "title": "Cohort Squeeze: Beyond a Single Communication Round per Cohort in Cross-Device Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Virtually all federated learning (FL) methods, including FedAvg, operate in the following manner: i) an orchestrating server sends the current model parameters to a cohort of clients selected via certain rule, ii) these clients then independently perform a local training procedure (e.g., via SGD or Adam) using their own training data, and iii) the resulting models are shipped to the server for aggregation. This process is repeated until a model of suitable quality is found. A notable feature of these methods is that each cohort is involved in a single communication round with the server only. In this work we challenge this algorithmic design primitive and investigate whether it is possible to \u201csqueeze more juice\u201d out of each cohort than what is possible in a single communication round. Surprisingly, we find that this is indeed the case, and our approach leads to up to 74% reduction in the total communication cost needed to train a FL model in the cross-device setting. Our method is based on a novel variant of the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM-AS) which supports a large collection of client sampling procedures some of which lead to further gains when compared to classical client selection approaches.",

                "value": "This paper presents SPPM-AS, a variant of the stochastic proximal point method that supports various protocols for sampling data. For federated learning, this translates to a federated optimization algorithm that supports various protocols for sampling clients. The method is proven to converge to an $\\epsilon$-approximate solution for strongly convex problems, and experiments show improvements compared to classical baselines."

                "value": "1. I don't see any significant theoretical improvement of the proposed algorithms.\n\n    1a. The iteration complexity is $1/\\epsilon$ (Line 212), which does not seem to improve upon FedAvg expect possibly in terms of constant factors. This is not too surprising considering that FedProx does not improve upon FedAvg, but there are already works in FL showing that the order of client sampling can improve convergence rate in terms of the $\\epsilon$ dependence [1]. Therefore the iteration complexity shown in this paper is not a significant improvement.\n\n    1b. The algorithm which enjoys theoretical guarantees cannot actually be implemented, because the choice of hyperparameters requires knowledge of the global minimum. The iteration complexity (Line 212) requires to choose the stepsize based on $\\sigma_{\\*,\\text{AS}}^2$, which can only be computed with knowledge of $x_*$.\n\n    1c. The only possibility for theoretical improvement is an improvement of constant factors from optimal stratified sampling (Lemma 2), but *optimal stratified sampling cannot be computed without knowledge of the global minimum*.\n\n2. I don't see any significant experimental improvement due to issues with the experimental methodology.\n\n    2a. The experimental evaluation only compares against naive baselines of Local GD and Minibatch GD. There are a huge number of works in FL that try to improve optimization with different client selection strategies, and these works are essentially ignored by this experimental evaluation (see [2] and its references). The authors' claim of $74$% improvement compares against the naive baseline, not against state-of-the-art (or any of the relevant existing work).\n\n    2b. SPPM-SS cannot be implemented with real data. As I pointed out in Weakness #1c, optimal stratified sampling cannot be computed without knowledge of the global minimum. To run experiments, the authors instead use a clustering heuristic that stratifies clients according to features, clustered using K-means. However, it is unclear whether such a clustering procedure can be executed in a real federated learning scenario when client data must remain on-device. Without this, a significant portion of the experimental results (Figures 1, 2, part of 3) only describe an algorithm which cannot be implemented in practice.\n\n    2c. The neural network experiments (Figure 4) may not be a fair comparison between LocalGD and SPPM-NICE. SPPM-NICE uses Adam as a local prox solver, which may not be a reasonable comparison against LocalGD, since LocalGD does not include any update preconditioning (known to be important for neural network training). It would be more appropriate to compare SPPM-NICE against LocalGD when SPPM-NICE uses GD as a local prox solver. An alternative is to compare SPPM-NICE w/ Adam against a local version of Adam, for example FedAdam. Appendix E.4 contains NN experiments with different local solvers (Figure 16), but I don't see exactly how these results related to those in Figure 4. It looks like the choice of local solver can create a gap of about 6\\% in train accuracy, and this is described as \"all methods perform similarly\" (Line 1526), whereas a similar gap between LocalGD vs. SPPM-NICE in Figure 4 is described as \"enhanced performance\" (Line 513).\n\n3. The paper exaggerates its own contribution and ignores relevant previous work. There are a huge number of works that improve federated optimization with different client selection strategies, which are ignored by this paper in terms of theory, experiments, and general framing (see [2] and its references). Some examples of exaggerated language that I find inappropriate:\n- Abstract: \"Virtually all FL methods operate in the following manner...\" This claim is not accurate; there are many works in FL that use peer-to-peer communication [3], asynchronous communication [4], etc. Further, I fail to see how the proposed algorithms of this paper do not also fall into the category described in the abstract.\n- Line 524: \"This foundational work showcases a pivotal shift in federated learning strategies\". I don't believe that this work departs very far at all from previous work in FL (e.g. [5] and related works). In my opinion, this kind of self-aggrandizing is not appropriate for a scientific publication.\n\n4. The message of the paper is not totally coherent. The abstract talks about \"cohort squeeze\" and novel communication principles, but most of the paper actually deals with client selection strategies within the standard intermittent communication structure. The experiments discuss local vs. global communication (Section 3.6), which seems to be the connection to the \"cohort squeeze\" of the title and abstract, but this section makes up a very small part of the paper's technical content.

The study delves into the effects of various hyperparameters\u2014including the learning rate and frequency of local communications\u2014on algorithmic performance. Empirical evaluations conducted across both convex (logistic regression) and non-convex (neural network) models substantiate the method's proficiency in lowering communication expenses without compromising accuracy, and in some cases, even enhancing it over current methodologies."
