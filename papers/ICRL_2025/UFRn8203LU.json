    "abstract": "Overparameterization in neural networks has demonstrated remarkable advantages for both memorization and generalization, particularly in models trained with gradient descent. While much of the existing research focuses on the interplay between overparameterization and gradient-based methods, we explore its influence on the loss landscape of $\\ell^2$ supervised regression problems, independent of any specific optimizer. By leveraging the Nyquist-Shannon-Whittaker sampling theorem, we establish a theoretical link between sampling theory and overparameterized neural networks. Our findings reveal that overparameterization not only exponentially increases the number of global minima but also expands the dimensionality of loss valleys for various $\\ell^2$ regression problems modelled with feedforward neural networks. We empirically validate these theoretical insights across multiple supervised $\\ell^2$ regression tasks, trained with both gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimization algorithms. These results offer fresh perspectives on the advantages of overparameterization in neural network design, independent of the chosen learning algorithm.",

                "value": "- Whereas the paper attempts to provide an analysis for how the global minima of loss landscapes change with additional neurons, I find their arguments not convincing enough and ill-justified. Primarily, the reason \nfor nonconvex optimization problems in neural network training being hard is not because of the non-existence of sufficient global minima, but usually because the optimizers usually get stuck in some local minima. Moreover, the plots in the paper demonstrate that as the models get bigger, the PSNR tends to increase. However, this does not verify the theoretical claims in the paper, as these improvements can simply be due to the fact that the networks become more expressive and are better at handling data.  I find the connection of having more global minima lacking in these experiments. In addition, as the neuron numbers are increased either in depth or width, the model parameter count will also increase. Therefore, the loss landscape will be in a different dimension. Hence, is it a fair comparison to say that in the higher dimensional parameter space the loss landscape will have more global minima now? \n\n- Moreover, in practical settings, why does having more global minima help, and do different global minima have the same generalization property? The generalization properties of the newly introduced global minima need further elaboration. Furthermore, the paper lacks the analysis of drawbacks of overparameterization during training, such as increased time and memory constraints to train the neural networks.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The paper does not analyze the generalizaton properties of the new global minima, and whether having more global minima always corresponds to having lower test error is unclear.\n\n- The experimental results do not directly verify the theoretical claims. How do you show that the PSNR gets better as model size increases because of the increased number of global minima, i.e. are global minima even relevant in those neural network experiments?\n\n- The paper fails to consider drawbacks of overparametrization, such as increased compute and memory cost."

It would be good to just give \"absolute\" results in terms of what happens to the loss landscape as a function of the number of neurons in the network, rather than provide the \"differential\" results as comparisons to a baseline case, as the two settings are not the same.\n\n- Can you clarify the connection between the trends seen in the experiments with your theoretical results? Why do you attribute the increase in PSNR as model size grows to an increased number of global minima? Can\u2019t the model be settled in another local minima that\u2019s just better in those cases?\n\n- Does this approach work only for MLPs? Can you not train superresolution instances with CNNs as well? It might be more helpful and realistic for image superresolution.\n\n- How do the generalization properties of the new global minima affect the test performance upon training an overparameterized neural network (say you add l neurons to a shallow sinc neural network or 3l neurons to a Relu neural network)?\n\n- Can you share the experimental figures (results) for your experiments (other than your PSNR curves)?\n\nMinor comments:  \n- On page 29, PNSR \u2192 PSNR\n\n- Throughout the paper, both \u201cdata set\u201d and \u201cdataset\u201d phrases are used.

NSW is constructive in that it asserts that the reconstruction can be done via a combination of appropriately scaled and shifted sinc functions. The authors consider the setting where the scalings and shifts of these sinc functions are made learnable. \n\nThe two main results of the paper state that\n1. the number of global minima in the training loss landscape increases exponentially in the number of hidden neurons.\n2. the dimensionality of global minima of ReLU networks grows in the width and depth of the network.\n\nTheir high level claim is that these two results indicate that the generalization of neural networks benefits from overparameterization."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Lack of references:\n\nThere is a lack of references concerning existing studies of the loss-landscape of neural networks. For example, similarities and differences to [1] should be discussed, since that paper seems to study a very similar question.\n\n- Poor motivation:\n\nIt is unclear whether untying the parameters in NSW can actually benefit generalization. At the very least, there should be some experiments that compare vanilla NSW reconstruction with trained sinc networks, showing that the latter can achieve lower test error (e.g. for some simple class of low-pass signals). In fact, the authors never properly define the test error, which in this setting should be the integral of the squared error over some continuous time interval.\n\nThere are not many papers in the literature that study sinc networks. It is worth noting that both of the two references in the paper (by Ravanelli and Bengio) are workshop papers. I suspect that networks with such activations can be hard to train in practise. This point should at least briefly be discussed since efficient optimization is an important aspect for the success of machine learning algorithms.\n\n- Severe misunderstanding of the implications of the geometry of the loss landscape for generalization:\n\nAn abundance of global minima is neither sufficient, nor even indicative of good generalization. To reach such conclusions, one must, in my view, either prove\u2014or at least provide some empirical evidence\u2014 that either\n1. a vast majority of global minima admits good generalization (and then \u201chope\u201d that the optimizer selects \u201ctypical\u201d global minima).\n2. the optimizer selects only well generalizing global minima, independent of the number or characteristics of global minima.\n\nNeither of the above things are taken into consideration. As highlighted, e.g., in line 60, the authors consider an abundance of global training minima as beneficial in its own right:\n\n> \u201cWhat is particularly interesting about this result is that it is independent of any optimizer, implying that for such networks, overparameterization provides a significant benefit for the loss landscape that should help any optimizer.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is generally not true if one simply enriches the landscape with many poorly generalizing global minima, as this will most likely make it harder for an optimizer to find well-generalizing solutions. A simple example is learning linear functions with empirical risk minimization over polynomials. One can trivially generate more interpolating solutions (global minima) by increasing the maximum degree of polynomials\u2014 however, almost all of these interpolators will generalize poorly. \n\nIn a similar manner, in Theorem 5.2, the number of interpolating solutions is increased by adding sinc functions centered outside the window [0,1] such that they evaluate to zero at the training sample. Notably, these sincs are generally non-zero over [0,1] outside the training points. Intuitively, most choices of such extraneous sinc functions will hurt generalization, since their side-lobes will leak into the interval [0,1]. The authors provide no insight into how harmful leakage might be avoided, neither explicitly nor implicitly by showing good generalization via experiments.\n\nTheorem 5.5 suffers from essentially the same technical issue in that it artificially increases the number of global minima (almost all of which generalize poorly) by constructing indicator functions (with triplets of neurons), which are supported outside the training set.\n\n- Misunderstanding of the connection between overparametrization and overfitting:\n\nThe authors state in line 105 that\n> \u201cWhile overfitting was once a concern, studies like Zhang\u00a0et al. (2021) showed that overparameterized networks can still generalize well, despite perfectly fitting training data\u201d. \n\nOverfitting is still very much a concern in general learning settings with neural networks! It is not the case that neural networks automatically avoid overfitting in all scenarios (i.e. for all distributions and optimizers). This follows for example from the no-free lunch theorem of learning, or, empirically, from the fact that neural net classifiers can interpolate random labels. Zhang et al showed empirically that some ReLU networks trained with SGD tend to avoid overfitting on some standard CV datasets. This does certainly not imply that sinc-activated networks trainined on band-limited signals admit a favourable implicit bias that prevents overfitting.\n\n- Minor comments:\n\nThroughout: \u201c< >\u201d -> \\langle \\rangle\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n[1]: Simsek, Berfin, et al. \"Geometry of the loss landscape in overparameterized neural networks: Symmetries and invariances.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

It would be helpful to clarify this, especially since one could argue that the \"width\" of the valley could be considered in relation to the ratio of the dimensionality of the valley to the dimensionality of the parameters, both of which are growing linearly.
