    "title": "DenseMatcher: Learning 3D Semantic Correspondence for Category-Level Manipulation from One Demo",
    "abstract": "Dense 3D correspondence can enhance robotic manipulation by enabling the generalization of spatial, functional, and dynamic information from one object to an unseen counterpart. Compared to shape correspondence, semantic correspondence is more effective in generalizing across different object categories. To this end, we present DenseMatcher, a method capable of computing 3D correspondences between in-the-wild objects that share similar structures. DenseMatcher first computes vertex features by projecting multiview 2D features onto meshes and refining them with a 3D network, and subsequently finds dense correspondences with the obtained features using functional map. In addition, we craft the first 3D matching dataset that contains colored object meshes across diverse categories. In our experiments, we show that DenseMatcher significantly outperforms prior 3D matching baselines by 43.5%. We demonstrate the downstream effectiveness of DenseMatcher in (i) robotic manipulation, where it achieves cross-instance and cross-category generalization on long-horizon complex manipulation tasks from observing only one demo; (ii) zero-shot color mapping between digital assets, where appearance can be transferred between different objects with relatable geometry. More details and demonstrations can be found at http://densematcher.github.io.",

DenseMatcher utilizes pre-trained 2D foundation models to extract multiview features, which are further refined using DiffusionNet. The enhanced features are then used to establish dense correspondences through a functional map. \n\nThey provide comprehensive experiment results to demonstrate DenseMatcher\u2019s effectiveness in 3D dense matching, zero-shot robotic manipulation, and color transfer tasks. DenseMatcher outperformed baseline methods on the DenseCorr3D benchmark and achieved a 76.7% success rate in real-world robotic manipulation, showcasing its robust generalization capabilities."

There is no experiment evaluating whether the model is able to learn invariance over such random coordinate system changes.\n  - The choice of negative cosine similarity in $L_\\textrm{semantic}$ is quite particular. The authors do not explain why they would choose this over e.g. L1 or L2 distances and also do not ablate this choice.\n  - Similarly, for $L_\\textrm{preservation}$, the choice of a single linear layer for reconstruction might hinder the encoder network to learn a more useful non-linear function. The more standard choice would probably be to mirror the encoder architecture like in an autoencoder, but this is neither discussed nor evaluated.\n- The method requires supervised training with an expensive 3D annotation workflow."

Why are other assignment and matching methods not compared as beaseline or ablation? e.g. Hungarian matching or the double-softmax used in [1]?\n- line 200: The requirement of textured 3D assets is very limiting. It seems to me the method could also work from an untextured geometry asset and posed images, or am I missing something?\n- line 242: Since the negative cosine distance is such an odd choice I suspect the authors were inspired here by related work? In that case it would be important to attribute this here with a reference.\n- line 252: \"object type and material\" is misleading. Neither one of the frozen backbones captures this information, both are self-supervised encoders of visual appearance that might correlate with this information in some cases.\n- line 254: What norm is used in the equation for $\\mid\\mid \\cdot \\mid\\mid$? Why is that one choosen?\n- Table 1: Please explain better the different ablation variants. Is \"w/o Diffusion Net\" directly matching the concatenation of $f_\\textrm{multiview}$ and the HKS features? Or is it also using the XYZ features and therefore failing because of coordinate system change? \n- Section 6.2.3: I dont't think the comparison to Robo-ABC is entirely fair. It would be good to show both variants, with the full affordance memory and with the reduced form that is currently presented. The proposed method is very expensive in terms of the 3D data it requires, so really it needs to show that this additional information can compete with methods that are only based on cheaper and more abundant image data.\n- Section 6.2.4: How is success determined in the experiments? Given the low number of overall trials, what level of statistical significance does the experiment currently have?\n\n\n\n[1] Lindenberger, P., Sarlin, P.-E., & Pollefeys, M. (2023).
