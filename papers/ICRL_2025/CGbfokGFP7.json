    "title": "3DTopia-XL: Scaling High-quality 3D Asset Generation via Primitive Diffusion",
    "abstract": "The increasing demand for high-quality 3D assets across various industries necessitates efficient and automated 3D content creation.\nDespite recent advancements in 3D generative models, existing methods still face challenges with optimization speed, geometric fidelity, and the lack of assets for physically based rendering (PBR). In this paper, we introduce 3DTopia-XL, a scalable native 3D generative model designed to overcome these limitations. 3DTopia-XL leverages a novel primitive-based 3D representation, PrimX, which encodes detailed shape, albedo, and material field into a compact tensorial format, facilitating the modeling of high-resolution geometry with PBR assets. On top of the novel representation, we propose a generative framework based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which comprises 1) Primitive Patch Compression, 2) and Latent Primitive Diffusion. 3DTopia-XL learns to generate high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that 3DTopia-XL significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 3D assets with fine-grained textures and materials, efficiently bridging the quality gap between generative models and real-world applications.",

                "value": "Weakness\uff1a\n1\uff09My concern is regarding the accuracy of the PBR materials. The fourth row in Figure 7 shows noticeably incorrect PBR materials. The paper claims to generate 3D assets with PBR textures, so it should include experiments on a 3D synthetic dataset where the ground truth metallic and roughness data are available.  For example, quantitative evaluations can be handily conducted on a synthetic dataset with ground truth PBR data using  PSNR or SSIM for albedo, metallic, and roughness maps.\n2\uff09As mentioned in line 292, the paper introduces patch-based compression aimed at incorporating inter-channel correlations between geometry, color, and materials. However, there is no experimental evidence to support this. As shown in Table 3, comparing line 1 and line 2, when the grid compression rate remains the same, reducing the feature dimensions representing different geometry, color, and materials from 6 to 1 actually results in a decrease in PSNR.  Authors could provide additional experiments or analyses that directly demonstrate the benefits of incorporating these correlations, such as comparing the proposed approach to a baseline that processes geometry, color, and materials independently.\n3\uff09It seems that the experimental results are missing an ablation study where patch-based compression is not applied. It would be even better if qualitative comparison results could be added.  The author could include an ablation study that compares their patch-based compression approach to a baseline without compression, showing both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons.\n4\uff09The current generated results lack diversity. It is better to include quantitative measures of diverse objects with complex topologies, such as challenging chairs, plants, and buildings, \n\nIn summary, I have concerns about the novelty of the paper. The 3D representation primarily extends existing work on M-SDF, and the performance of the extended features, such as PBR material, is not satisfactory. Additionally, despite the use of patch-based compression, the reported computational cost is substantial, requiring 16 nodes of 8 A100 GPUs around 14 days to converge. In comparison, InstantMesh only needs 8 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Moreover, compared with instant mesh, the generated geometric results in this paper tend to be overly smooth, losing geometric details, as shown in Figure 5."

This framework, combined with PrimX, enables high-quality and large-scale 3D asset generation, accommodating complex tasks like image-to-3D and text-to-3D conversion with better quality and efficiency compared to existing approaches.\n\n3. The paper provides a detailed and efficient method for converting the PrimX representation back into a textured mesh in GLB format. This process ensures high-quality asset extraction by applying techniques like UV unwrapping, dilating, and inpainting, making the output ready for various downstream applications in graphics engines, with minimal additional processing required."

Further defining these terms would add clarity.\n\n3. The paper mentions using initialized positions and scales, where I is a unit local voxel grid.

More context on what this setup accomplishes geometrically would help clarify this step.\n\n4. Unclear about the role of permutation equivariance in PrimX and its impact on the Transformer model's design. Clarifying how permutation equivariance inherently maintains structure among primitives or why it aligns well with Transformer processing would be helpful."

That said, the claim of the possibility to learn from 2D images using PrimX is over-claimed.\n2. How are the primitives ordered for a single object during the diffusion process? Will the order affect generation quality?\n3. What is the advantage of using a local VAE instead of a global one, does it bring better quality? Or is it just cheaper to train? If you can train a DiT of ~1B, training a global VAE shouldn't be a big burden. The authors should provide this additional ablation on the VAE.\n4. Although the authors claimed to be \u201crapidly tensorizable\u201d, the speed for texture mesh to PrimX is actually very slow, as each shape takes 1.5 min for the conversion. I wonder how long it takes to process all these 250k training objects.\n5. 4.1 representation evaluation: why not compare with sparse voxel and vecset? Also, what if the number of params of all methods is increased, like 5M and even 25M? Will the proposed representation still have privilege? The proposed representation also failed to reproduce texture details, e.g. the eyes in Fig 4. Can this problem be alleviated with more parameters? Besides, I think a more valuable comparison would be fixing the number of parameters in the encoded/latent space, as this is where the diffusion model runs.\n\nGiven the limited improvement over existing methods, the untenable motivation, and the missing evaluations, I lean to reject this paper. However, I'm willing to raise my score if the authors provide justifications for my above questions, and add missing results as listed in the weaknesses."
