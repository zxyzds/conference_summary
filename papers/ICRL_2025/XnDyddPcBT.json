    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have sparked significant interest in understanding their inner workings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling transformer architectures using highly flexible non-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our proposed model fully parameterizes all the weights of attention and feed-forward blocks through neural networks, with weights articulated as functions of a continuous layer index. We examine the model's dynamics through spectral analysis, uncovering an increase in eigenvalue magnitude offering a practical insights against weight-sharing assumption in existing theoretical studies. We also introduce the use of the Lyapunov exponent to examine token-level sensitivity, improving model interpretability. Our neural ODE transformer performs similarly to GPT across various configurations and datasets, while offering flexible fine-tuning capabilities under different architectures.",

Insufficient Analysis Rigor:\n- The spectral analysis lacks formal theoretical guarantees or concrete connections to model performance.\n- The Lyapunov exponent analysis is essentially equivalent to analyzing the Jacobian of transformer blocks, which varies with each input and doesn't provide generalizable insights.\n- Many claims about model behavior are supported by cherry-picked empirical observations without theoretical justification.\n3. Experimental Limitations:\n- The performance improvements over baseline models are modest and inconsistent across different settings.\n- The ablation studies don't sufficiently justify the architectural choices, particularly the dimension of time embeddings.\n- The paper oscillates between being an analysis paper and an empirical paper without excelling in either direction.\n\n4. Presentation Issues:\n- The paper structure is somewhat disjointed, with early sections (1-4) largely reiterating existing work.\n- Many design choices appear arbitrary and lack proper motivation or ablation studies.\n- The relationship between the theoretical analysis and practical benefits isn't clearly established."

I really enjoyed reading this manuscript!\n\n**Significance:**\n\n* I believe this Neural ODE approach can have impact and can serve as starting point for further research.

                "value": "**Quality:**\n\n* The experimental setup related to Language Modelling (6.1) uses arguably old models (GPT2). Although the experiments are useful to understand how DiffEqFormer is able to match performance, I missed a comparison with a current SOTA model. I believe this work could have more impact if a recent model was included, not needing an extremely large model, but maybe a 1B parameter LLM. For example,  [Llama-3.2-1b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) or [Gemma-2-2b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b) could be excellent candidates.\n\n**Clarity:**\n\n* I felt that the discussion about _attractive_ and _repulsive_ scenarios (5.1) is a little bit disconnected from the rest, and much harder to parse. For example, I could not directly understand why a $V=-I_d$ behavior leads to model collapse. Also, in the conclusion of this section (L336) the authors emphasize that \"_positive values from the QK pairs in Figure 2a and the copying behavior observed in the OV pair_\" hint to the presence of induction heads in the last layer(s). However, I understood that what is important is the magnitude of QK pairs, and the positiveness of OV pairs. There is a mismatch between this conclusion and the claims in the explanation.  I encourage the authors to revisit this section and provide a clearer explanation of why the QK, and specially the OV analysis, is important.\n\n**Significance:**\n\n* As said, this work can be impactful given the applicability of DiffEqFormer. However, lacking a comparison with SOTA LLMs can diminish such impact."

                "value": "**Questions**:\n\n* I encourage the authors to add a section (main body or appendix) about the computational differences betwee DiffEqFormer and a vanilla Transformer. For example, ML practitioners could be interested in training time, total number of parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory required and any other significant parameter the authors might think of, given their expertise in the field.\n\n* In Section 5.2, I suggest including interpretability results using attention matrices, to make the differences claimed evident to the reader.\n\n* In Section 6, can the authors elaborate on the choice of experimental setup? Why is GPT2 chosen among the breadth of language models available? Unless the constraints are compute-related, I believe this work could be much more impactful if DiffEqFormer was compared to a recent LLM architecture.\n  * If some recent LLM was used, I am really intrigued in knowing about other metrics related to \"_emergent capabilities_\" are for DiffEqFormer. For example, does it perform better at 0-shot reasoning, on MMLU, etc? I am not asking the authors to provide all this analysis, but I definitely encourage them to include at least a comparison with a recent LLM.\n\n* As far as I understand, the model is trained at fixed time intervals. I wonder whether the authors have thought about training at randomized time steps, as it is typically done for diffusion models.  Is it even feasible? Could this allow a more flexible adaptive fine-tuning later on? I would appreciate some discussion on this aspect during the rebuttal, for my better understanding of the work.\n\n**Comments**:\n\n* Overall, I believe this is a nice piece of research work. I enjoyed the reading and learnt throughout. My main concern is about the experimental setup. A comparison with some modern LLM would be very important to convince the community that DiffEqFormer is _equivalent_ to Transformer with the additional unique advantage of adaptability+interpretability. I am completely open to increase my review score upon a fruitful rebuttal.\n\n* I would like to share my opinion about the experiments in Tables 1-2. Although the authors try to explain why GPT2-large is slightly better in terms of PPL for OpenWebText, I believe the strength of these results lie in DiffEqFormer being similar (not necessarily better) to GPT. \n\n**Suggestions for readability + typos:**\n\n* Very minor: Fig 1-b could have the arrow sin blue, as a connection with what is shown in Fig 1-a.\n* L304: The OV matrix ~has~ have eigenvalues\n* L322: model ~collapse~ collapses\n* Fig 6 (legend) ~cratch~ scratch"
