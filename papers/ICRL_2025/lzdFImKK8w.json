    "abstract": "Predicting the change in binding free energy ($\\Delta \\Delta G$) is crucial for understanding and modulating protein-protein interactions, which are critical in drug design.\nDue to the scarcity of experimental $\\Delta\\Delta G$ data, \nexisting methods focus on pre-training, \nwhile alignment receives less attention.\nIn this work, we propose the Boltzmann Alignment technique to transfer knowledge from pre-trained inverse folding models to $\\Delta\\Delta G$ prediction.\nWe begin by analyzing the thermodynamic definition of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ and introducing the Boltzmann distribution to connect energy with protein conformational distribution. \nHowever, the protein conformational distribution is intractable; therefore, we employ Bayes\u2019 theorem to circumvent direct estimation and instead utilize the log-likelihood provided by protein inverse folding models for $\\Delta\\Delta G$ estimation. \nCompared to previous inverse folding-based methods, our method explicitly accounts for the unbound state of protein complex in the $\\Delta \\Delta G$ thermodynamic cycle, introducing a physical inductive bias and achieving both supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance.\nExperimental results on SKEMPI v2 indicate that our method achieves Spearman coefficients of 0.3201 (unsupervised) and 0.5134 (supervised) on SKEMPI v2, significantly surpassing the previously reported SoTA values of 0.2632 and 0.4324, respectively.\nFuthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our method on binding\nenergy prediction, protein-protein docking and antibody optimization tasks.",

                "value": "This paper employs pre-trained inverse folding models based on the Boltzmann distribution and thermodynamic cycles to associate energy with log-likelihood from inverse folding models for predicting \u0394\u0394G. It introduces both unsupervised and supervised inverse folding models, each achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy on the SKEMPI v2 dataset. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the proposed thermodynamic cycle is effective and offers advantages over traditional SFT and DPO methods. Notably, the method does not strictly require crystal structures when a reasonably accurate predicted structure is available. Furthermore, the paper explores applications of this approach in binding affinity energy prediction, protein-protein docking, and antibody optimization."

In Section 4.1, Dividing the dataset into 3 folds by structure cannot strictly prevent data leakage, different protein complexes might have similar protein binding structures, can you elaborate more about the method you used to split data and prevent data leakage? \nCould you explain more about data partition process, why it can help to reduce data leakage process?\n\n2. Could you explain more about data partition process, and why it can help to reduce data leakage process?\n\n3. The SKEMPI dataset includes both single-point mutations and multiple-point mutations. Given the varying complexity, predicting binding affinity for single-point mutations may be less challenging and could potentially yield more accurate prediction results compared to multiple-point mutations. This raises the question: why not consider training separate models tailored for single and multiple mutation binding affinity prediction tasks, rather than using a single model for both?"

Beyond that, authors demonstrate applicability of their method across several tasks (binding energy prediction, antibody optimisation and docking).

The limitations and weaknesses are appropriately discussed. It focuses on relevant and important problem in protein science - predicting the energetic effect of mutation on the free energy of protein-protein complex formation. The contribution is clearly original, correctly references and builds upon several already existing contributions in the field (in particular - inverse folding models, direct preference optimisation). Most importantly, benchmark reports significant improvement across several investigated metrics on commonly-accepted dataset (SKEMPI) and described ablations and controls (folded structures) strengthen the confidence in the reported result."

                "value": "- In section 4.4.3 authors utilise dataset from Shen et al (2022) however focus only on point mutations. This dataset is, I think, much richer and contains double and triple mutants from multiple optimisation rounds. I believe it would be important to expand this section to show proposed model performance more extensively. This, I believe, has a potential to boost the impact and trust in the model in a typical antibody design scenario. \n- Following on sec 4.4.3 - preference probabilities are a good metric but they in my view they are a bit abstract. I think a simpler metric of e.g. how the method ranks particular mutation would be more interpretable (as they relate to simple consideration of how many designs one can screen in the wet lab before finding a particular hit). \n- In the typical design scenario, as the problem is hard and the reported performance of the method is not perfect, one can also consider the uncertainty of the prediction which is an important and frequently used feature in e.g. protein folding models. It could potentially strengthen the paper if authors could discuss and provide more information on how uncertainty estimation could be introduced to the model.\n- In appendix B - authors write \"We compare BA-DDG with several representative methods under single-point, multi-point, and\nall-point mutations on SKEMPI v2\". It's not clear to me what is the difference between multi-point and all-point mutations. Is the all-point a union of point- and multi-point mutations (I'd assume so by looking at the following Table) ? For clarity authors can consider to explain this more in the paper. \n- The discussion about computational (non-ML) methods for ddG estimation is scarce. Even though it's purely ML venue, I miss a bit more thorough discussion of how the proposed method relates to force-field methods utilising more nuanced thermodynamical cycles / approaches like MM-GBSA/PBSA, FEP, TI, etc."
