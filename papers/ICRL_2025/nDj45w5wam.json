    "title": "Causal Information Prioritization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from sample-inefficiency, resulting from blind exploration strategies that neglect causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards. Although recent causal approaches aim to address this problem, they lack grounded modeling of reward-guided causal understanding of states and actions for goal-orientation, thus impairing learning efficiency. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Information Prioritization (CIP) that improves sample efficiency by leveraging factored MDPs to infer causal relationships between different dimensions of states and actions with respect to rewards, enabling the prioritization of causal information. Specifically, CIP identifies and leverages causal relationships between states and rewards to execute counterfactual data augmentation to prioritize high-impact state features under the causal understanding of the environments. Moreover, CIP integrates a causality-aware empowerment learning objective, which significantly enhances the agent's execution of reward-guided actions for more efficient exploration in complex environments. \nTo fully assess the effectiveness of CIP, we conduct extensive experiments across $39$ tasks in $5$ diverse continuous control environments, encompassing both locomotion and manipulation skills learning with pixel-based and sparse reward settings. Experimental results demonstrate that CIP consistently outperforms existing RL methods across a wide range of scenarios.",

This may limit its scalability and adaptability to new tasks without re-engineering.\n- Empirical results, especially in Table 1, show limited improvement over baselines like ACE and BAC. The gains aren\u2019t always significant, especially given the complexity and additional engineering that CIP requires. The benefits may not justify the added complexity in some cases.\n- Some results in Table 1 indicate the CIP approach performs on par with or even below baselines for certain tasks, suggesting that the improvements might not generalize strongly across all evaluated environments."

Is it possible to reduce the engineering effort required for this, or is the approach dependent on manual structure provision?\n- Were there specific reasons for the chosen baselines (ACE, BAC)? Would other baselines, particularly those that handle causality differently, add more context to the results?\n- What are the plans for integrating 3D world understanding or extending CIP to work more naturally with object-centric or high-dimensional MDPs without predefined causal structures?"
