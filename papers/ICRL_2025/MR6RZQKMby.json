    "title": "Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-$k$ Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps. Furthermore, we observe that model kinship can serve as an early stopping criterion, enhancing the efficiency of  model evolution. We hope that the proposed  model kinship can provide guidance and insights for the future merging and evolution of LLMs.",

The authors first empirically validate the relationship between kinship and performance gains, demonstrating their consistency. Building on the concept of kinship, they propose a Top-k Greedy Merging method that shows some performance enhancements compared to baseline approaches."

The research motivation is insufficient, leading to a lack of logical clarity in the arguments presented.\n\n2. While introducing human-like concepts or analogies from other fields can be a valuable approach to problem-solving, the kinship metric designed in this paper lacks a reasonable formulation and effective validation, which undermines its applicability.\n\n3. The logical coherence and rigor of the writing require significant improvement to enhance the overall quality of the paper.\n\n4. The conclusions drawn in the paper lack persuasive power due to the absence of quantitative experimental analysis. The methodology and experimental design appear relatively crude, which detracts from the credibility of the findings."

The paper explores the concept of \"model kinship,\" which measures the similarity or relatedness between large language models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to biological evolution. Through empirical analysis, the authors demonstrate that this kinship can predict the performance gains when merging models, offering a basis for selecting suitable candidates for merging.\n\n2. Building on this, they propose a strategy called Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which improves performance on benchmark datasets. The study shows that using model kinship not only helps avoid local optima during model evolution but also serves as an early stopping criterion, enhancing efficiency. The authors suggest that their findings provide valuable insights for future LLM merging and evolution."

It is recommended that the authors add a dedicated subsection analyzing the datasets used and explaining why these specific datasets (e.g., general-purpose or domain-specific test data) were chosen for performance evaluation.\n\n2. In the appendix (Figure 8), the authors present performance analysis based on various merging experiments using the Mistral architecture. However, it is unclear whether the results are applicable to other architectures like LLaMA, which suggests the idea may have some limitations. Although the authors mention in the limitations section that the performance on other architectures remains unknown, I strongly recommend testing on LLaMA or other types of LLM architectures to make the argument more robust and solid.\n\n3. In Algorithm 1, the authors use Greedy Merging with Model Kinship; it is suggested to include an ablation study to demonstrate that the greedy algorithm is indeed the optimal choice."
