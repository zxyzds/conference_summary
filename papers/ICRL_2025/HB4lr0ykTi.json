    "title": "Wasserstein Flow Matching: Generative modeling over families of distributions",
    "abstract": "Generative modeling typically concerns the transport of a single source distribution to a single target distribution by learning (i.e., regressing onto) simple probability flows. However, in modern data-driven fields such as computer graphics and single-cell genomics, samples (say, point-clouds) from datasets can themselves be viewed as distributions (as, say, discrete measures). In these settings, the standard generative modeling paradigm of flow matching would ignore the relevant geometry of the samples. To remedy this, we propose \\emph{Wasserstein flow matching} (WFM), which appropriately lifts flow matching onto families of distributions by appealing to the Riemannian nature of the Wasserstein geometry. Our algorithm leverages theoretical and computational advances in (entropic) optimal transport, as well as the attention mechanism in our neural network architecture. We present two novel algorithmic contributions. First, we demonstrate how to perform generative modeling over Gaussian distributions, where we generate representations of granular cell states from single-cell genomics data. Secondly, we show that WFM can learn flows between high-dimensional and variable sized point-clouds and synthesize cellular microenvironments from spatial transcriptomics datasets.

                "value": "My main concern is related to the limited significance of the developed methodology. As the authors themselves admit (ines 235-236), the main contribution of this article is the developed algorithm. From a theoretical point of view, the method is based on the results proposed in previous works (Ambrosio et al., 2008, Lambert et al., 2022). At the same time, the authors note that these theoretical results are correct if the algorithm is applied to absolutely continuous measures, which is not true in the case when the measures are approximated as point clouds. Thus, it is not absolutely fair to apply the algorithm to any measures other than Gaussians.\n\nMeanwhile, the theoretical groundlessness of the algorithm could be overlooked if it showed inspiring results from a practical point of view. However, the method demonstrates good results only when working with distributions that can be approximated by families of Gaussian distributions (including the spatial transcriptomics dataset, see lines 414-420). In the case of working with more general measures (point clouds), the method shows results that do not outperform those of its competitors (see Table 3 and authors comment in lines 95-96).\n\nIn addition, the experimental part could be improved by including more baselines, for example in problems from the single cell biology domain. In this regard, you might be interested in considering the methods from two recent papers that also rely on flow matching and consider problems from single cell biology (Klein et al., 2024, Eyring et al., 2024).\n\n**Overall**, in my opinion, the presented practical results alone are not enough to publish the paper at the current conference."

The authors present tractable training objectives and sampling schemes for both settings, relying on closed-form solutions available in the Bures\u2013Wasserstein space, and the approximation of the optimal transport map by entropic couplings in the point-cloud setting. Notably, their methodology allows for the generation of point-clouds with non-uniform size. They further validate their framework via experiments with single-cell genomics data and 2D and 3D point-clouds, presenting competitive results and improved scalability."

Additionally, the approach first estimates McCann\u2019s interpolation using traditional methods, followed by the FM algorithm. This sequential combination of the two algorithms feels somewhat incremental in terms of contribution.\n\n- For cases where families of particle sets (point cloud) are considered, the paper estimates entropic OT, which deviates from the theoretical framework. Calculating the McCann's interpolant $\\mu_t$ requires estimating the standard OT rather than entropic OT. \n\n- Even with reduced computational overhead through estimating entropic OT, I believe there would be still huge computational burden when estimating $\\mu_t$ in point cloud application. It might be helpful if the authors could specify the computational costs associated with solving entropic OT during training. I believe there would be scalability issues when the number of particles becomes more than 2000.\n\n- Overall, the method involves an inaccurate approximation (e.g. standard OT -> entropic OT) and seems to be computationally demanding (e.g. sinkhorn for every iterations). Moreover, its performance results is not convincing for me, too. I believe the benefit of WFM method and the potential applications should be more carefully carried."
