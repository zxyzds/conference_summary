    "title": "Beyond Sequence: Impact of Geometric Context for RNA Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around 2-5x training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.",

                "value": "1. The authors utilized a limited number of 3D models for geometric structure modeling, most of which are relatively early models, and neither of the two models (EGNN and SchNet) is specifically designed for 3D RNA structure modeling. Therefore, I believe their performance does not fully reflect the potential improvements offered by geometric information across various datasets. The authors are supposed to validate models specifically designed for RNA 3D structure modeling, such as ARES [1] and PaxNet [2], as well as some classic models in the protein domain (like GVP [3], GearNet [4], and MEAN [5]).\n\n2. The pooling strategy is difficult to classify as an innovative contribution from the authors, as it is relatively simple. Thus, the models employed in the paper are essentially existing models, and the authors have not proposed their own model. Since 3D data encompasses more information than 1D and 2D data, the authors should reflect on how to better utilize 3D information to enhance model performance.\n\n3. As noted in the paper, \"all-atom SchNET and EGNN rely on a limited local neighborhood of adjacent atoms, limiting their receptive fields and preventing them from capturing long-range dependencies\", full-atom modeling indeed incurs a significant computational burden. The authors could consider adopting the approach from methods like MEAN [5], treating each nucleotide as a node in a graph, which would allow for the expansion of local neighborhood relationships. Alternatively, the strategy used in PaxNet [2] could be employed to model the long-range and short-range interactions.\n\n4. The analysis in section 4.2 lacks insights. Some conclusions are quite obvious, such as the enhancement of performance due to increased training data, which is even more pronounced in transformer-like structures. Moreover, the inferior performance of 3D models compared to 2D models can be attributed to the significantly lower prediction accuracy of existing methods for 3D structures compared to 2D structures.\n\n5. The analysis in section 4.3 presents similar issues. Since the authors introduced sequencing noise, this error accumulates greater noise in both 2D and 3D data as a result of using 2D and 3D predictive tools. Therefore, it is expected that the transformer1D, which directly models 1D sequence data, would exhibit stronger performance.\n\n[1] Geometric deep learning of RNA structure, Science 2021.\n\n[2] Physics-aware Graph Neural Network for Accurate RNA 3D Structure Prediction, NIPS 2022 workshop.\n\n[3] Learning from Protein Structure with Geometric Vector Perceptrons, ICLR 2021.\n\n[4] Protein representation learning by geometric structure pretraining, ICLR 2023.\n\n[5] Conditional Antibody Design as 3D Equivariant Graph Translation, ICLR 2023."
