    "title": "FedSR: Frequency-Aware Enhancement for Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Image super-resolution (ISR) is a classic and challenging problem in low-level vision because the data collection process often introduces complex and unknown degradation patterns. Leveraging powerful generative priors, diffusion-based algorithms have recently established new state-of-the-art ISR performance. Despite the promise, current diffusion-based ISR methods mostly focus on the spatial domain, revealing a lack of understanding of the frequency domain. To bridge this gap, we first experimentally verify that the key to solving the ISR problem lies in addressing the degradation of image amplitude information and high-frequency details. Based on this insight, we propose a novel frequency-aware enhancement framework ($\\textbf{FedSR}$) for diffusion-based ISR methods, which consists of two critical components. Firstly, we design the Amplitude Enhancement Module (AEM), which selectively enhances crucial amplitude channels through weighted optimization. Secondly, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HEM) that adaptively masks the skip features to perform high-pass filtering. Through extensive evaluations on both synthetic datasets and real-world image collections, our method demonstrates outstanding performance in reproducing realistic image details without additional tuning. For instance, FedSR improves StableSR across three datasets by an average of $\\textbf{+10.53}\\\\%$ on MUSIQ metric.",

The observations presented in Figure 1, such as the significance of high-frequency information for image recovery, are well-known in the field and thus cannot be considered novel contributions to this study.\n2. As shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the proposed method exhibits no improvement\u2014and in some cases, a decline\u2014in performance on reference-based metrics. Although pixel-aware metrics like PSNR and SSIM may not fully align with human perception, perceptual metrics such as LPIPS and DISTS should be included to better evaluate the fidelity of the results. Relying solely on non-reference metrics is insufficient for assessing recovery quality, as these metrics can be influenced by artifacts and noisy textures, which also applies to the results in Table 4.\n3. Frequency-based approaches for super-resolution have become quite prevalent, as exemplified by methods like [1][2]. The lack of novelty in the frequency-focused aspect of the proposed method limits its contribution to the field.\n4. In Figure 4, particularly the first, third, and fourth rows of the squirrel example in the first column, the textures of the squirrel pelts have transformed into pseudo-textures after applying the proposed method, raising further doubts about the reliability of the improved non-reference metrics.\n\n[1] Image Super-resolution via Latent Diffusion: A Sampling-space Mixture of Experts and Frequency-Augmented Decoder Approach \n\n[2] Frequency-Domain Refinement with Multiscale Diffusion for Super Resolution"

Could you specify the meaning of 'the radius' in Lines 343\u2013344?\n3. The model incorporates several hyperparameters; are these adjusted manually, or is there a systematic approach to optimizing these hyperparameters for different super-resolution backbones?"

The authors argue that the amplitude information and high-frequency information in the image are crucial for addressing the image degradation problem through experimental analysis. However, it is questionable whether these components always play a pivotal role at different time step T in the denoising process, because the function of the diffusion model is different at different time steps. \n2. Although the proposed method achieves good results in the no-reference metrics, there are negative optimization results in the visual comparison shown in Figure 4. For example: (1) within the results of StableSR+ours, DiffBIR+ours, and SeeSR+Ours concerning image1, the animal hair appears more artificial and unrealistic; (2) within the results of SeeSR+Ours concerning image1, the background area where the plants are located is incorrectly generated; (3) within the results of SeeSR+Ours concerning image4, the loss of high-frequency details pertaining to the plants in the lower left corner contrary to the viewpoint proposed in the paper. \n3. How are the values of P_b and r_thresh determined in Equation 8? The authors are encouraged to conduct additional experimental analyses to enhance comprehension surrounding these parameters."

Lack of Novelty in Motivation: The motivation presented in Figure 1 is not novel and has appeared in numerous low-level vision papers, including but not limited to:\n\n- Exploring Fourier Prior for Single Image Rain Removal.\n\n- Deep Fourier-based Exposure Correction Network with Spatial-Frequency Interaction \n\nThese papers are not discussed in the paper either. The insights in the contribution section (page 107) seem incremental.\n\n2. Although FedSR+ enhances existing SR methods on metrics like CLIP-IQA, it significantly lowers fidelity on PSNR and SSIM, which is contrary to the paper\u2019s motivation. For instance, in Table 1, using the proposed method reduces StableSR\u2019s PSNR by 0.67dB, which is quite unacceptable.\n\n3. Lack of Complexity Analysis: The paper does not discuss the computational complexity introduced by FedSR, such as parameters and FLOPs. If the method significantly increases computational overhead while offering only marginal improvements, it would have limited practical deployment value.\n\n4. Potential Unrealistic Details:\n- Figure 4 shows images without ground truth (GT). \n- It appears that applying the proposed method may introduce \u201cunrealistic\u201d texture details, thus improving metrics like CLIP-IQA, which are less sensitive to fidelity, while decreasing PSNR, which is fidelity-sensitive.\n5. Need for User Study:   It is crucial to conduct a user study to validate that the enhanced details provided by the proposed method are \u201creal\u201d and consistent with the GT. Emphasizing fidelity is extremely important in SR tasks; without it, the task may as well be a generation task.\n6. There are several existing papers on real-SR in the frequency domain, but the paper lacks discussion and comparison in this regard, including but not limited to:\n-  Image Super-resolution Via Latent Diffusion: A Sampling-space Mixture Of Experts And Frequency-augmented Decoder Approach.\n-  Wavelet-based Fourier Information Interaction with Frequency Diffusion Adjustment for Underwater Image Restoration.\n-  Waving Goodbye to Low-Res: A Diffusion-Wavelet Approach for Image Super-Resolution."
