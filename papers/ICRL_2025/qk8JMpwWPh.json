    "title": "Learning Generalizable and Well-Shaped Reward Functions from Too Few Demonstrations",
    "abstract": "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is an important problem that aims to learn a reward function and policy directly from demonstrations, which can often be easier to provide than a well-shaped reward function. However, many real-world tasks include natural variations (i.e., a cleaning robot in a house with different furniture configurations), making it costly to provide demonstrations of every possible scenario. We tackle the problem of few-shot IRL with multi-task data where the goal is for an agent to learn from a few demonstrations, not sufficient to fully specify the task, by utilizing an offline multi-task demonstration dataset. Prior work utilizes meta-learning or imitation learning which additionally requires reward labels, a multi-task training environment, or cannot improve with online interactions. We propose Multitask Discriminator Proximity-guided IRL (MPIRL), an IRL method that learns a generalizable and well-shaped reward function by learning a multi-task generative adversarial discriminator with an auxiliary proximity-to-expert reward. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple navigation and manipulation tasks.",

However, the paper provides limited discussion on existing adversarial imitation learning approaches, aside from GAIL[1]. A more comprehensive overview and comparison of relevant adversarial imitation methods[2], along with a discussion on how different design choices influence learning, would strengthen the contextualization and emphasize the novelty of the work.\n\nThe discriminator $D(s, a)$ is trained on a multi-task dataset but relies on the current policy, making the reward signal relative rather than absolute. Consequently, the learned reward function therefore would not independently specify the task.. Addressing or clarifying this limitation would be beneficial.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"too few demonstrations\" should be more thoroughly explained in the introduction to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the experimental setup and motivation.\n\nThere is an issue in Equation 3: the inequality $> c_{thresh}$ is missing in the first condition.

Could the authors elaborate on how this minimum value was derived or calculated? Providing a more detailed explanation or derivation would enhance the reader's understanding.\n\n**Parameter Justification**: In Appendix C.4, it is mentioned that $\\lambda_{prox} = 6$ for all tasks and that the proximity discount $\\gamma = 0.001$. How were these specific values chosen, and what was the rationale behind setting these parameters? Additionally, could the authors discuss what the potential impact might be if $\\gamma$ were set to a larger value? Exploring this would help clarify the sensitivity and robustness of the proposed approach to these hyperparameters.\n\n**Consideration of Alternative Algorithms**: Have the authors considered using other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to optimize the proposed reward function in Equation 4? An analysis or discussion on the choice of RL algorithm and the potential benefits or drawbacks of using alternatives like SAC would be insightful.\n\n**Clarification on Few-shot IRL vs. Meta-learning**: In Section 2.2, the authors discuss the distinction between Few-shot IRL and meta-learning. However, this difference is not entirely clear. Could the authors provide a more in-depth explanation or additional context to better articulate how these two concepts differ?"

MPIRL utilize two different reward term, proximity reward and discriminator reward. Proximity utilizes the expert for the reward signal, which could provide more rich signal to guide compared to using reward learners. Proximity reward P(s) penalizes states based on the temporal distance to the expert state distribution. Also, for the other part, MPIRL learns a adversarial discriminator for the multi-task demonstration. To learn the adversarial distriminator, MPIRL use state-action tuples from the same task as positive pairs, and tuples from different tasks or from the policy as negatives."
