    "title": "Group Downsampling with Equivariant Anti-aliasing",
    "abstract": "Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., $G$-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups *with* anti-aliasing. This involves the following: **(a)** Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup.  **(b)** Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into $G$-equivariant networks",

                "value": "While the method is thorough, the authors are losing an opportunity to demonstrate the implications and significance of anti-aliasing in an experiment. Given that accuracy and results are only shown on benchmark datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR, whether this approach would benefit large-scale experiments is unknown. Here are suggestions and clarifying comments for improvements:\n\nThe paper lacks information on how their work differs from the prior works listed in related works. For example, how is the literature currently performing such a task? Is the literature completely missing such a subsampling framework for equivariance networks, hence the absence of comparison baselines? Is the key message of the paper that prior works don't do anti-aliasing? Or they do sub-sampling differently, which results in a non-equivariant map.\n\nThe experiments can be more thorough. They are limited in its current stage.\n\n- Can the author focus on an application where the impact and benefits of anti-aliasing is better shown? Perhaps for an application where high-frequency information is of importance. An analysis on the artifacts and impacts of those due to naive sub-sampling can also help.\nResults on MNIST in its current form are limited.\n\n\nMinor\n\n- I suggest not using bold phrases (such as line 44) in the paper.\n\n- In Example 1, the middle label should be (b).\n\n- I suggest not coloring the Lemma, Claim, etc., and following ICLR formatting instructions."

How this work differs from this prior work? Are there other works in the literature that address the discussed issue? If yes, please include these in the intro.\n\n- It would be nice to show with a toy example why subsampling in groups is not an intuitive task of \"every other sample\" and what can go wrong. In this version of the paper, this intuition is not well-discussed.\n\n- Prior to this paper how the literature is doing sub-sampling on groups? Could Table 1 include such a comparison where other approaches fail?"

Specifically:\n\n- Signals are defined over groups. This is highly non-standard in the equivariance literature, and it\u2019s not clear how the methods presented here fit into the existing space of equivariant works. This is greatly illustrated in Section 5.1 and Figure 3, where the groups $C_{16}$ and $D_{16}$ are used essentially to label the nodes and have no effect on the actual signal. For rotationally-equivariant architectures, we fully expect the feature maps themselves to exhibit equivariance, which is not the case in this work. If that is not possible using this framework, this severely limits the applicability.\n- Interpolation in (8) is defined on a subsampled signal. This is highly canonical in signal processing, where interpolation can be applied independently of downsampling. It sees this is necessary for the authors\u2019 analysis, however this is not motivated or explained at all."

            "questions": {
                "value": "On top of the above weaknesses I had some further questions:\n\n- On line 57 the authors claim that the subsampling layer selects suitable subgroups for the tasks. There are a couple of issues with this: first of all, how is \u201csuitable\u201d defined in this context? In what way do the authors support that claim and how is it evaluated in their experiments? Finally, and maybe most importantly, the statement mentions tasks: however, their subsampling algorithm is task-agnostic and performs the subgroup choice without any knowledge about the downstream task. In what way, then, is the subgroup that is selected suitable for the task?\n- The definition of the minimal generating set in 125 is weird. The way things stand, since by construction $e\\notin S$, it can never hold that $\\langle S \\rangle = G$, for any $S$.\n- There are multiple typos in the footnote in line 323. There is also a typo in 343 (no space between $\\mathcal{M}$ and the previous word), and also on 501 $\\textrm{Acc}_{\\textrm{orbit}}$ appears twice."

However, one can argue that the original group C24 and D24 are too \"large\" and probably unnecessary to begin with. It would be interesting to see the comparison to a G-CNN without any subgroup downsampling and start with the smallest group used in the last layer of the proposed method. \n3. Also, the advantage of algrithm 1 (automatically determine a subgroup based on the subsampling rate) on Cn and Dn is not clear.
