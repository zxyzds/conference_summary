    "title": "Can Watermarked LLMs be Identified by Users via Crafted Prompts?",
    "abstract": "Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. \n    However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services.\n    This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, \n    while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. \n    Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.",

Could you provide some experiments on watermark detection on closed-source models such as ChatGPT using your tool? Since the proposed method is a black-box setting, this should be achievable.\n3. In the method for enhancing the key pseudorandomness of the Water-Bag Strategy, your use of the \"set of master keys and their inversions\" approach lacks theoretical support. Does \"inversions\" refer to bit flips, or does it refer to certain keys that satisfy the constraints of equation (12)? If it\u2019s the former, then the claim of enhanced pseudorandomness has no basis; if it\u2019s the latter, the paper does not explain how to derive the inversion key space that satisfies equation (12), and it seems that satisfying (12) does not have a direct relationship with the pseudorandomness of $K^*_j$. The experiments in Table 2 test methods against the attacks proposed by the authors, without directly testing the pseudorandomness of the sequences in the key space using suites like NIST SP 800-22. Ultimately, this seems to only indicate that the specific method enhances defense capabilities against the proposed attacks, rather than demonstrating that the enhancement of pseudorandomness leads to improved defense capabilities, which is inconsistent with the authors' previous claims."

The author just talk about how to identify LLM output consistency, I never see any discussion about watermark injection in paper. The authors should clarify how their work relates to the injection and detection steps they have outlined, or explain why their approach focuses solely on identification without addressing injection.\n\n- **Unknown Key Sampling Strategy**: the author propose the watermark identification method using setected prompts.\nStep 1-3 only discuss the object of identification key sampling, never talk about the detail of identification key sampling.\n\n- **Method Designed**: The author says \u201cResearch on the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs should investigate whether watermarked and non-watermarked LLMs can be distinguished.\u201d. However, in this paper, I never see the sampled prompts and identification method can solve this problem.
