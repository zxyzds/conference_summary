    "title": "What Are Good Positional Encodings for Directed Graphs?",
    "abstract": "Positional encodings (PEs) are essential for building powerful and expressive graph neural networks and graph transformers, as they effectively capture the relative spatial relationships between nodes. Although extensive research has been devoted to PEs in undirected graphs, PEs for directed graphs remain relatively unexplored. This work seeks to address this gap. We first introduce the notion of *Walk Profile*, a generalization of walk-counting sequences for directed graphs. A walk profile encompasses numerous structural features crucial for directed graph-relevant applications, such as program analysis and circuit performance prediction. We identify the limitations of existing PE methods in representing walk profiles and propose a novel *Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE*, which extends the Magnetic Laplacian eigenvector-based PE by incorporating multiple potential factors. The new PE can provably express walk profiles. Furthermore, we generalize prior basis-invariant neural networks to enable the stable use of the new PE in the complex domain. Our numerical experiments validate the expressiveness of the proposed PEs and demonstrate their effectiveness in solving sorting network satisfiability and performing well on general circuit benchmarks.",

                "value": "The authors propose (i) the notion of walk profile in a directed graph for counting bidirectional walks with given numbers of forward and backward edges between two nodes and (ii) a novel positional encoding (PE) which can provably reconstruct the walk profiles of the directed graph. This PE is a direct extension of Magnetic Laplacian PE (Mag-PE) to multiple phase shift parameters q (potentials): the position of a graph node is represented by concatenating Mag-PEs for the different parameters. \n\nIn particular, they prove that in order to reconstruct walk profiles of some length L between any two nodes, just over half of this length is the number of potentials needed in their Multi-q Mag-PE. They also identify that expressing walk profiles is robust to the choice of the q values. Additionally, they generalize their PE, using ideas from previous stable PE frameworks, towards node-stable and edge-stable representations. \n\nIn the experimental section, Multi-q Mag-PE is benchmarked against Laplacian, SVD and Mag-PE in predicting node pair distances and and classifying synthetic graphs; their PE is also coupled with backbone models to predict properties of real word circuits and its robustness explored. In most cases, Multi-q Mag-PE demonstrates a consistent performance gain over comparison baselines with up to x3 execution overhead (due basically to processing/training for more q's)."

Actually SVD seems to be a good choice for compactly expressing powers of special structures like (A * A^T) or its transpose; powers of A are not the only matrices to use in the presence of both forward and backward links/edges. \n\n- Could you provide a more detailed justification of how Equation (2) is produced? (currently: \"By the definition\" (line 260)).\n\n- A practical issue with Mag-PE is what q to choose. In Multi-q Mag-PE the choice of q's does not seem to be a critical factor in performance outputs (e.g. discrete Fourier transform based vs randomly sampled). Is there a justification for this empirically observed robustness? Or again, some care choosing q's should be exercised, but now on the range from which to select q's? For example for the case of random graphs q's are in (0, 1/2) range but for sorting network (satisfiability tasks) q's lie in a much \"slimmer\" range (defined as a function of the number nodes and edges)?\n\n- What is the role of m in Equations (3), (4) (also consider balancing paretheses in these: minor, unbalanced \"{\" instead of \"(\" appear in them)?"

                "value": "This paper proposes a new positional encoding for node representation in directed graphs with provably better expressive power and stability. The paper starts by discussing Magnetic Laplacians with potential $q$, and introduces the concept of *walk profiles*, the number of walks of lengths $l$ given $l - k$ backwards passes of an edge, a more informative descriptor of directed graphs than the standard adjacency powers could provide. It then shows how a Magnetic Laplacian fails to predict walk profiles. Given this, the paper then proposes a simple extension, Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian Positional Encodings, and shows that this extension, with $Q$ distinct q values selected from the range $[0, \\frac{1}{4})$ can predict walk profiles of length $L$ of nearly double $Q$ (Precisely, $Q = \\lceil \\frac{L}{2}\\rceil + 1$). The paper then studies the stability of complex positional encodings returned with multiple Qs and proposes an invariant encoding mechanism (SPE) to circumvent the increasing ambiguity of complex eigenvectors and eigenvalues. \n\nEmpirically, the paper conducts extensive experimentation, both on real-world and synthetic baselines. In synthetic settings, the paper proposes a setting in which models must predict (normalized) walk profiles and other structural properties (shortest path, longest path) over directed graphs. In these experiments, Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE with SPE clearly demonstrates superior performance, even with respect to the same model with other encoding choices than SPE (such as SignNet). Moreover, the paper reports ablation results on the selection of $q$ values, showing that multiple $q$ values are indeed necessary for performance, and that even only using the best $q$ cannot reproduce the best results. A robustness study is also reported, highlighting that performance is robust to choices of $q$, and even improves slightly with random (distinct) $q$ values. In terms of real-world experiments, the paper conducts an extensive experimental study on a suite of directed graph benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance improvements with Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE across several baseline models. Finally, the paper discusses runtime for pre-processing, training and inference using their approach, and shows that while $q$ does lead to increased runtimes, these increases are palatable."

Overall, the flow of argumentation in this paper is smooth, balanced, and easy to follow, with all pre-requisite results presented in good time.\n- The experimental analysis is compelling and extensive. I especially appreciate the synthetic results and the targeted study of structural graph property predictions, which in my opinion really emphasizes the contribution of the paper's approach. These findings are also further supported by ablation and robustness analysis, and comprehensive details in the appendix. Real-world experiments are also strong and convincing. All in all, the empirical analysis ties very nicely with the theoretical results, and corroborates its results nicely."

Moreover, there are no connections to existing measures of models\u02bc expressivity (e.g., $k$-WL[1]).\n- It is not clear whether the authors have attempted any other methods to provide information about walk profiles.
