    "title": "CheapNet: Cross-attention on Hierarchical representations for Efficient protein-ligand binding Affinity Prediction",
    "abstract": "Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a critical challenge in drug discovery, crucial for understanding drug efficacy. While existing models typically rely on atom-level interactions, they often fail to capture the complex, higher-order interactions, resulting in noise and computational inefficiency. Transitioning to modeling these interactions at the cluster level is challenging because it is difficult to determine which atoms form meaningful clusters that drive the protein-ligand interactions. To address this, we propose CheapNet, a novel interaction-based model that integrates atom-level representations with hierarchical cluster-level interactions through a cross-attention mechanism. By employing differentiable pooling of atom-level embeddings, CheapNet efficiently captures essential higher-order molecular representations crucial for accurate binding predictions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CheapNet not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple binding affinity prediction tasks but also maintains prediction accuracy with reasonable computational efficiency.",

                "value": "This paper proposes a new solution to the protein-ligand binding problem, namely modeling molecules and proteins at a higher level than the atom (cluster level). This motivation comes from the fact that modeling only at the atomic level can easily lead to computational burden and reduced accuracy. Experiments on the ligand affinity prediction and ligand efficacy prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method."

                "value": "1. The writing logic of the article is not smooth, making it less readable. Two examples: (1) In the first paragraph in Introduction, a better presentation would be to first introduce the task, then talk about the wet lab approach and limitations, and finally analyze the challenges of deep learning models in solving this problem. Then, the purpose of the sentence describing DTI is also unclear and can be deleted. (2) Why does line 047 begin with \"however\"? Didn't you just talk about the limitations of atom-level modeling?\n\n2. The motivation is reasonable, that is, the entire functional group may interact with a certain protein region. However, the pooling method used does not seem to guarantee this. Can the author consider, at least, adding additional loss to ensure that clusters represent the functional group?\n\n3. The significance of hierarchical representation is usually to allow the model to adaptively learn and select features from different information channels. I also agree that some interaction cases come from the entire functional group rather than the atom, but this is not absolute. Therefore, I prefer dual awareness at the atom-level and cluster-level. Although cluster-level representations are derived from atom encoders, this only complies with the strong assumption that individual atoms do not participate in interactions. The framework I suggest is to use atom selectors (such as attention selection or gating algorithms) to filter important atom representations to merge with cluster representations.\n\n4. Let's analyze the title. This paper's greatest contribution seems to be to propose a specialized adaptive attention mechanism for hierarchical representation learning. However, the proposed cross-attention algorithm seems to be only for the cluster level. In addition, if this is the case, what is the difference between the proposed method and directly adopting the cross attention module in [1]?\n\n5. This is a point I would like to discuss with the author. In this paper, the author allows complex input, but only uses this information in atom embedding computation. Perhaps there is a more explicit way to use this information. Since we already know the rough range of where the interaction occurs, why not use it to guide the coefficient of cross attention. For example, assuming that cl:1 and cp:2 are clusters of ligand and protein at the interface, the correlation coefficient between cl:1 and cp:2 should be much higher than the others.\n\n\n[1] Learning Harmonic Molecular Representations on Riemannian Manifold.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. How to determine the number of clusters for ligand and protein?\n\n2. In fact, the proposed method still needs to learn effective atom-level representation to obtain pooling results and cluster representation. What is the advantage in computational efficiency?\n\n3. The method in this paper does not seem to be limited to processing protein and ligand interactions, but can also handle protein-protein related tasks (please correct me if I am wrong). If the authors can perform additional experiments such as protein-protein interaction, protein-protein docking or protein-protein interface prediction, it will further prove the scope of the proposed method."

CheapNet employs the DiffPool method to cluster atoms in both the protein and ligand, reducing complexity while retaining the critical protein-ligand interaction patterns. The use of the cross-attention mechanism between protein and ligand clusters highlights the most relevant inter-molecular interactions, filtering out less impactful interactions and reducing the computational costs.\n\n3. The authors utilized the PDBbind and  CSAR NRC-HiQ datasets to benchmark CheapNet against different types of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction models, They evaluated the model performance on ligand binding affinity and ligand efficacy prediction using different performance metrics. Subsequently, ablation studies were conducted to evaluated the model's effectiveness, focusing on adaptability of cluster-attention, hierarchical representations and attention mechanism, and cluster size. The experiments are comprehensive, and demonstrate CheapNet's superior performance."

In the section 'Permutation Invariance of Clusters for Cross Attention', the authors demonstrate that CheapNet\u2019s cross-attention mechanism ensures permutation invariance for protein and ligand cluster-level representations. However, in protein-ligand interactions, three types of symmetries\u2014translation, rotation, and permutation\u2014should be considered. In my opinion, discussing whether and how the model achieves rotation and permutation invariance in local coordinates, as well as translation, rotation, and permutation equivariance in global coordinates, is essential. Only focusing on discussing the permutation invariance is insufficient."

If CheapNet is not able to address other types of symmetries,  then discuss howthis might impact the model's performance or generalizability, and the further improvement."
