    "title": "Interactive Adjustment for Human Trajectory Prediction with Individual Feedback",
    "abstract": "Human trajectory prediction is fundamental for autonomous driving and service robot. The research community has studied various important aspects of this task and made remarkable progress recently. However, there is an essential perspective which is not well exploited in previous research all along, namely individual feedback. Individual feedback exists in the sequential nature of trajectory prediction, where earlier predictions of a target can be verified over time by his ground-truth trajectories to obtain feedback which provides valuable experience for subsequent predictions on the same agent. In this paper, we show such feedback can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the model's predictions on a specific target and heuristically guide to deliver better predictions on him. We present an interactive adjustment network to effectively model and leverage the feedback. This network first exploits the feedback from previous predictions to dynamically generate an adjuster which then interactively makes appropriate adjustments to current predictions for more accurate ones. We raise a novel displacement expectation loss to train this interactive architecture. Through experiments on representative prediction methods and widely-used benchmarks, we demonstrate the great value of individual feedback and the superior effectiveness of proposed interactive adjustment network. Our code will be made publicly available.",

                "value": "In this work, an online learning methodology is proposed for trajectory prediction based on the insight that ground truth observations checking past predictions (named feedback) can be collected as time goes on. To leverage this insight, the authors propose an interactive adjustment network (IAN) and evaluate its efficacy using a variety of trajectory prediction algorithms on a set of pedestrian and athlete motion datasets."

                "value": "In contrast to the claims in the paper, this work is not the first to study feedback in trajectory predictions. Accordingly, the primary weakness of this work is a lack of discussion and comparisons to prior adaptive prediction work that investigates this same idea. Notable examples (which focus on both temporal adaptation, equivalent to individual feedback, and geographic adaptation) include:\n* Y. Xu, L. Wang, Y. Wang, and Y. Fu, \"Adaptive trajectory prediction\nvia transferable GNN,\" in IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern\nRecognition, 2022.\n* B. Ivanovic, J. Harrison, and M. Pavone, \"Expanding the deployment envelope of behavior prediction via adaptive meta-learning,\" in IEEE Conf. on Robotics and Automation, 2023.\n\nThe experimental setup relies primarily on small-scale pedestrian-only datasets. Further, these datasets are quite old (ETH/UCY are 10-15 years old, GCS is more than 10 years old, the NBA dataset is almost 10 years old), meaning performance has largely saturated on them and it is difficult to tell if the proposed method significantly improves upon baselines.\n\nAs stated in Section 5.4, a prediction model and the IAN are _consecutive_ modules, meaning they have to run one after the other (and not simultaneously as stated in Line 523). This means that there is a 20ms overall runtime increase as a result of adding the IAN."

Why is IAN better or more preferable to use by practitioners?\n\nHow does this approach perform on modern large-scale datasets with multiple types of agents and varying dynamics, e.g., Waymo Open Motion Dataset, nuPlan? These datasets also have less saturated metrics which should make it easier for the IAN's performance improvements to stand out."

Adaptive models and online learning techniques have long incorporated past errors to improve future predictions. The bigger issue is the lack of adequate differentiation of IAN from existing methods i.e., a thorough literature review that situates its contributions within the broader context.\n- While the authors introduced a new loss function, there is no analysis of the properties of the displacement expectation loss or proofs of convergence and stability.\n- There is a lot of poorly defined notation, making it difficult to understand the proposed method fully.

In Tab1-2, minADE/minFDE is a direct metric in mearusing the best-case similarity for multi-modal predicted trajectory.
