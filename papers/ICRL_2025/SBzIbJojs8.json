    "title": "HiSplat: Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable Sparse-View Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Codes will be released upon acceptance.",

The hierarchical representations appear to be memory-intensive and computationally inefficient. It is recommended that the paper discusses the implications for memory, FLOPs, and inference time.\n3. The rationale for incorporating the DINO feature seems underwhelming, and the provided experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the necessity of including the DINO feature.\n4. I hope to see additional experiments conducted to explore the impact of increasing the number of perspectives on the quality of reconstruction. It appears that the majority of the experiments presented in the article are limited to just two perspectives, which may not fully capture the potential benefits of a multi-perspective approach."

The improvement in metrics compared with baseline method does not seem very significant from the reviewer's perspective. But the generalization capability to unseen datasets like DTU seems interesting. The authors can show more cases that demonstrates generalization capability. \n3. Some of the visualized cases does not seem to possess a very significant improvement compared with MVSplat. For example, the last line of Fig.6; the left red bounding box in the first example in Fig. 1."

Will the number of Gaussian primitives change significantly after applying this hierarchical structure? A comparison with baseline methods on the primitive numbers will be nice.\n2. It seems that the first example in Fig.6. shows that HiSplat can generate less artifacts in the occluded area, as highlighted by the red bounding box. Does this just happen in coincidence or is it a prevalent phenomenon?\n\nI still have the aforementioned concerns and I would be glad to raise my rating if they can be addressed."

The way the authors integrate the multi-scale features is clever and interesting. I love the Error Aware part, HiSplat wisely incorporates the reconstruction error refinement, usually through gradient optimizations, into this feed-forward reconstruction model.  The error maps are used to guide the refinement on the higher levels. I believe this idea can also be beneficial for other related tasks.\n3. The analysis in 4.4 is very informative and useful. The figures effectively demonstrate how multi-scale features can help improve the reconstruction quality."

I am not very clear which modules are trainable and which are not. The authors should clarify and summarize this in 3.6. Also, it would be even better, this is not required for rebuttal, if HiSplat could be a relatively simpler unified foundation model (e.g., like LRM).  \n2.

Since it is unlikely we can always get accurate camera poses from sparse views in real life, can this work be extended to handle the pose-free sparse-view reconstruction for the captures from real life? If it is easy to implement, it would be great to see some examples.\n2. The depth coefficient $\\eta$ is a bit tricky. I assume it is a fixed value for each stage after the training, is this correct? If so, how do you choose the proper $\\eta$ values?"

Especially, FreeSplat also uses a cost-volume-based structure to estimate the depth and then Gaussians with multi-scale strategy. A step further, the architecture of this work is also somehow similar to CasMVS [3] that uses a cascade structure to solve the MVS depth estimation task. The main differences lie in how the multi-scale features are used. Need more deeper discussions about these related works to show the technical differences and more valuable analysis.\n\n- The setting of this paper seems to be fixed at using only two images. Would like to see some discussion about if it's possible to extend the method to more input views, just like what FreeSplat does. Even if it is a part of limitation, it would still be much valuable.\n\n\n\n[1] Wang, Yunsong, et al. \"FreeSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting Towards Free-View Synthesis of Indoor Scenes.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.17958 (2024).\n\n[2] Smart, Brandon, et al. \"Splatt3r: Zero-shot gaussian splatting from uncalibrated image pairs.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.13912 (2024).\n\n[3] Gu, Xiaodong, et al. \"Cascade cost volume for high-resolution multi-view stereo and stereo matching.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020."
