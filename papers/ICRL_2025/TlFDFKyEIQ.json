    "title": "Oldie but Goodie: Re-illuminating Label Propagation on Graphs with Partially Observed Features",
    "abstract": "In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed. Although the recently proposed Feature Propagation algorithm mitigates such situations to some degree, it falls short when only partial features are available, sometimes performing worse than traditional structure-based graph models. To overcome this limitation, we spotlight a classical algorithm, Label Propagation (Oldie), and further illuminate its potential, especially when only a partial feature is available. Now called by Goodie, it takes a hybrid approach to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP branch. Then, Goodie automatically captures the significance of structure and feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention. Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP branch, Goodie outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, Goodie, outperforms the existing state-of-the art methods not only when only a few features are available but also in abundantly available situations.",

Key baselines lack. There are some GNNs that are also designed for the situation of missing data, such as [*3,*4].

A basic assumption of the proposed method seem like \"homophily assumption\": connected nodes have similar feature & labels. In this case, will the proposed method also work well on heterophily graphs? If yes, please attach more results on heterophilic datasets; if not, it's better to point out and discuss this limitation."

To address this issue, the authors propose to combine the classical label propagation with feature propagation. Specifically, the output of predictions of LP are mapped to hidden embeddings that align with FP. Some pseudo labelling and contrastive learning strategies are utilized to optimize the model\u2019s parameters. Experimental results on 7 public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model could achieve good performance compared with existing baselines."
