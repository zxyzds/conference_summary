                "value": "This paper presents a framework for Transformer circuit analysis, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and Transcoders. The authors develop SAEs to capture fine-grained features from model activations, while Transcoders enable deterministic tracing through non-linear MLP layers. The proposed Hierarchical Tracing methodology isolates and interprets circuits at both local and global levels, allowing insights into tasks such as subject-verb agreement and indirect object identification. Additionally, an automated workflow incorporating GPT-4o is introduced to scale circuit analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively uncovers Transformer model behaviors by tracing individual SAE-derived features. This framework offers improved interpretability of model mechanics and shows robust performance across various tasks. Results reveal insights into activation flows within Transformer layers, providing an understanding of the model's response to linguistic structures."

Can the framework transfer to other Transformer models with different architectures?\n2. **Novelty and Scope**: The use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for feature extraction is well-explored in the interpretability domain, and prior works have leveraged SAEs for fine-grained feature decomposition in neural models. Could the authors clarify what novel insights their application of SAEs brings to Transformer circuit analysis beyond existing approaches? Specifically, how does this method offer interpretability that surpasses traditional linear probes or other SAE-based frameworks?\n3. **Quantitative Evaluation**: Although the paper includes experiments, the results are primarily qualitative. Additional quantitative analysis comparing interpretability and accuracy trade-offs with similar approaches (e.g., linear probes or standard SAE circuits or model editing methods [1, 2]) would make the findings more robust.\n4. **Automated Workflow Limitations**: While the automated workflow using GPT-4o is a strong addition, its effectiveness is not fully substantiated. The authors should provide clearer benchmarks or comparison metrics to illustrate how it scales relative to other interpretability frameworks."

No code is provided, and no hyperparameters are provided for Hierarchical tracing. No explanation of how \"manual tracing\" was conducted is described.\n* Only some results are presented for each behavior studied. Only for subject-verb agreement is any faithfulness measurement provided. Only for in-bracket activation is percentage of feature's activation provided. Only for in-bracket activation and indirect object identification are graphs provided. More results for each methods would allow readers to understand how faithful explanations are for more complex behavior, and it would also allow readers to understand what the graphs look like for the only behavior for which faithfulness was measured.\n* Examples of the graphs produced by GPT-4o would also allow the reader to get a better sense of how good these are (the human ratings are not as informative as examples of graphs).\n\n**Lack of evidence for faithfulness or usefulness**\n\n* The IOI graphs are provided as is, without any evaluation of their faithfulness, which is especially concerning since they were built using manual tracing.\n* Previous work has shown that the percentage of loss explained by graph explanations (as measured with causal scrubbing) was often low. Applying similar metrics to the explanations provided here might highlight a lack of faithfulness of the explanations. Because this paper does not present such measurements, nor any downstream activations, future work is required to determine if the process describe by the paper produced explanations that have other qualities than their plausibility.\n\n**Unjustified implications of high explanation quality**\n\nThe paper implies that the annotations and explanations are much more reliable than they are shown to be. The paper only provides weak evidence of faithfulness, only providing strong evidence that the method is helpful to produce highly plausible explanations. This is not enough to claim a superiority in explanation quality or the ability to actually understand how a behavior was implemented, especially given that previous works have shown that interpretability illusions are common when plausibility is used as the main criteria to evaluate explanation quality. Here is a non-exhaustive list of places where this seems particularly problematic:\n\n* \"This provides a transparent view of the model\u2019s decision-making process.\" (line 317) is misleading given the potentially high level of unfaithfulness of the explanations.\n* The last sentence of the abstract might need to be revisited to not imply a level of explanation faithfulness that is higher than demonstrated, especially since some prior work actually provided a better justification of the faithfulness of their methods.\n* The \"in-bracket\" SAE feature is unlikely to be fully explained by \"is this token in brackets\", as the activations vary considerably between the different tokens in brackets. Adding a sentence in section 5.1 explaining this approximate nature would help.\n\n**Minor comments**\n\n* The subject-verb agreement tasks are not described.\n* The distribution used for the in-bracket task is not described.\n* $y$ in equation 2 is undefined.\n\n**Overall assessment**\n\nThis paper would be above the bar if the faithfulness limitations were highlighted and if either easily usable code was released, or if the lacking materials was released, or if the faithfulness measurements was improved."
