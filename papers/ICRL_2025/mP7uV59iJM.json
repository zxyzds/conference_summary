    "title": "GSLoc: Efficient Camera Pose Refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting",
    "abstract": "We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement framework, GSLoc. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GSLoc obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.",

Using 3DGS as the scene representation, RGB images and depth maps are rendered based on the initial camera pose of the query image estimated by other methods.

Finally, the relative pose is solved through PnP to optimize the initial camera pose. Compared to previous camera pose optimization methods based on cost functions and optimization, the GSLoc pipeline achieves one-shot pose optimization, offering advantages in both speed and accuracy. The effectiveness of GSLoc has been validated on indoor and outdoor visual localization datasets."
