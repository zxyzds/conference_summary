    "abstract": "In the context of the mineral fertilizer industry, a crucial sector for global food production, which faces challenges in production efficiency and fast quality control, this work introduces the Mineral Fertilizer Dataset (MFD), a novel annotated segmentation dataset comprising 1,608 images and 125,648 instances of various fertilizer granules with different colors. Addressing the lack of datasets in this field, the MFD supports both semantic and instance segmentation tasks. Baseline models based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), UNet, and MANet were trained for semantic segmentation, while baseline models based on Mask R-CNN, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and Mask2Former were trained for instance segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of these models, as well as the robustness of the trained models in identifying fertilizer granules of different colors not included in our dataset, as well as other granular objects such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) pellets, corn, beans, and even pharmaceutical tablets. This dataset, along with its benchmark results on existing semantic and instance segmentation algorithms, aims to facilitate further advancements in computer vision applications for quality control in the fertilizer industry and related sectors.",

The authors assess the performance of classical semantic and instance segmentation techniques using the MFD, highlighting its applicability for fertilizer granule segmentation tasks."

                "value": "While the paper provides a benchmark evaluation of several classical semantic and instance segmentation techniques on the MFD, it lacks a significant technical contribution to the field. Given the unique features of the dataset, the authors could consider proposing a tailored model to achieve better segmentation performance.\n\nThe authors claim that the MFD dataset is designed for quality control in the fertilizer industry. However, it would be helpful to demonstrate how the segmentation results directly contribute to the quality evaluation process. For example, how do the segmentation metrics (e.g., accuracy, IoU) correlate with key quality control parameters in fertilizer production, such as granule size distribution or shape uniformity? Additional explanations are also needed to clarify the displayed experimental results.\n\nThe experiments conducted on extended datasets with similar morphological characteristics lack sufficient detail. A detailed table or description specifying the models used to segment beans, seeds, and tablets, along with their corresponding performance metrics, would strengthen the extended experiments.\n\nAlthough the dataset may be valuable for the fertilizer industry, the paper lacks a clear discussion of novel ideas or distinguishing contributions. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the novel contributions or to draw a more direct comparison between this dataset and approach and existing methods in the fields of industrial quality control or granular material analysis."

The authors state in the Abstract, \"our experiments demonstrate ... the robustness of the trained models in identifying fertilizer granules of different colors not included in our dataset.\" However, this claim is not supported in the experiment section. Which experiment validates this statement? Given that the segmentation networks used are classical ones, like FPN, Unet, and MANet, what exactly do the authors mean by this claim?\n\n2. In Line 85, the authors mention that isolating individual granules from the overall mask makes the method more acceptable for the fertilizer industry. Why would this isolation process improve industry acceptance?\n\n3. What does the x-axis of the Violin plot in Figure 3 represent for each type of fertilizer granule?\n\n4. In Figure 4, why are only a few KCl granules annotated?\n\n5. What is the intended explanation in Lines 262\u2013268?\n\n6. Which models were employed to segment objects with similar morphology, as shown in Figures 9 through 12?"
