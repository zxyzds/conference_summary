    "title": "Learning Gain Map for Inverse Tone Mapping",
    "abstract": "For a more compatible and consistent high dynamic range (HDR) viewing experience, a new image format with a double-layer structure has been developed recently, which incorporates an auxiliary Gain Map (GM) within a standard dynamic range (SDR) image for adaptive HDR display. This new format motivates us to introduce a new task termed Gain Map-based Inverse Tone Mapping (GM-ITM), which focuses on learning the corresponding GM of an SDR image instead of directly estimating its HDR counterpart, thereby enabling a more effective up-conversion by leveraging the advantages of GM. The main challenge in this task, however, is to accurately estimate regional intensity variation with the fluctuating peak value. To this end, we propose a dual-branch network named GMNet, consisting of a Local Contrast Restoration (LCR) branch and a Global Luminance Estimation (GLE) branch to capture pixel-wise and image-wise information for GM estimation. Moreover, to facilitate the future research of the GM-ITM task, we build both synthetic and real-world datasets for comprehensive evaluations: synthetic SDR-GM pairs are generated from existing HDR resources, and real-world SDR-GM pairs are captured by mobile devices. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GMNet over existing HDR-related methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

The paper should consider running the evaluation on this metric too.\n\nIt is not clear about Q_max. Q_max value should not be in the range of [0,1], is that correct? If so, I_GM is not in the range [0,1] either. And can not normalize it as well, the reviewer wonder how the loss can be calculated and how the model was converged? \n\nFinally, as there is a upsampling function when estimating I_GM, the reviewer think that that I_GM might not represent the real I_GM precisely due to the interpolation function when applying upsampling (which can be either nearest neighbors or bidirectional)."
