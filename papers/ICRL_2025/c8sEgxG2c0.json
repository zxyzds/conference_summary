    "abstract": "We introduce GenomeOcean, a 4-billion-parameter genome foundation model that natively generates DNA sequences that are adherent to the input context. \nWith an efficiency-oriented model design, GenomeOcean is 80 times faster than existing models of similar size in genome generation. \nUnlike most existing genome foundation models\u2014such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformers\u2014that are designed for discriminative tasks, GenomeOcean leverages generative modeling to unlock new potentials in genomics research. \nDiverging from the traditional reliance on reference genomes\u2014which possess inherent biases\u2014GenomeOcean is exclusively trained on large-scale curated environmental samples collected from diverse ecosystems, including oceans, lakes, forests, and soils. This extensive genomic diversity, encompassing uncultured and uncharacterized organisms, allows GenomeOcean to generate sequences that better reflect the true diversity of life.\nIn a series of automated evaluations, we demonstrate GenomeOcean's capability to understand and follow context sequences. \nCompared to existing models, GenomeOcean not only better retains species information but also produces sequences with more appropriate open reading frame lengths and codon usage bias.\nWe anticipate the open release of GenomeOcean to open up new possibilities in genomics and computational biology research.",

                "value": "In this work, the authors introduce GenomeOcean, a 4-billion parameter autoregressive transformer model trained to generate DNA sequences. Notably, the model is trained on a newly curated dataset of large-scale environmental samples collected from diverse ecosystems, including oceans, lakes, forests, and soils. The authors conduct a thorough ablation study to determine the optimal tokenizer, model architecture, and training objective. They emphasize GenomeOcean's ability to generate sequences in-context, meaning it can be prompted with an existing DNA sequence fragment, and highlight its efficient inference speed achieved through the utilization of high-performance libraries. Furthermore, the authors develop a benchmark comprising three tasks designed to assess the model's ability to (1) generate sequences representative of a given species, (2) reproduce the length distributions of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) found in nature, and (3) reproduce codon usage distributions observed in nature. GenomeOcean is compared against existing methods, Evo and GenSLMs, demonstrating improved performance across the benchmark."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "However, the paper exhibits the following limitations:\n\n- The paper lacks significant research contributions. The authors repeatedly claim high inference speed as a major contribution. While they demonstrate efficient code, they primarily utilize existing codebases. Consequently, this represents good engineering practice rather than a novel research contribution. A true contribution would involve proposing a new method for accelerating such models, specifically within the context of DNA generation. The second claimed contribution is the ablation study; however, similar ablations have been performed extensively in the literature, such as in NT, DNABert, HyenaDNA, and Evo. While the authors' slightly different setting justifies a new ablation study, the actual contribution remains limited. The third and primary claimed contribution is the introduction of a new dataset. However, the dataset is not adequately discussed, with minimal information provided. Given its central role in the work, the dataset requires a proper introduction and detailed description within the publication.\n\n- The experimental protocol focuses on three specific tasks, while the model is intended to be generic. The authors should either (1) design a more comprehensive set of tasks across various domains to evaluate the model's generalizability or (2) focus on fewer tasks with more in-depth analysis to understand the specific genomic knowledge captured by the network. For example, the authors could investigate whether their model captures enhancer-promoter interactions better than existing models (see the insightful biological analyses in [1]) or if the attention maps can capture RNA secondary structures (see the recent work [2]). They could also leverage and adapt recent ideas from D3, a diffusion model for DNA sequences [3].\n\n- Interpreting the performance differences between Evo, GenSLM, and GenomeOcean is challenging. Since all three models are trained with the same loss function and prompted similarly, the only differences lie in (1) their architecture and (2) pre-training data. The authors do not discuss the pre-training data or the extent of overlap between the downstream datasets and the pre-training datasets for each model, making it difficult to gain insights from the comparison.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the high presentation quality, tutorial aspects, and strong engineering, the publication lacks sufficient contributions for a conference like ICLR. A major concern is the emphasis on the new pre-training dataset, which is not adequately discussed."

                "value": "Questions / Comments:\n\n- The term \"genome foundation model\" is potentially confusing, as it implies the model can generate complete genomes. The authors should consider using the more common terms \"sequence model\" or \"DNA sequence model\".\n\n- In Figure 3 (right), presenting losses for CLM and MLM on the same graph may be misleading, as losses across different training objectives cannot be directly compared.\n\n- In Figure 3 (left and center), could the authors clarify the difference between \"Transformer (MLM)\" and \"DNABert2\" and explain the observed performance difference?\n\n- Regarding the species generation experiment, the authors mention using 2kbp prompts. It is unclear whether this length provides sufficient context for species discrimination. Notably, HyenaDNA showed that 1kbp is insufficient for species differentiation and that at least 32kbp is required. While the species studied here might differ (the studied species here are not explicitly stated), further clarification on this point is needed.\n\n- The authors should reference [4] in the context of generating species-conditioned sequences.\n\n\n\n[1] https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.30.555582v1.full.pdf\n\n[2] https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.605418v1.full.pdf\n\n[3] https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.23.595630v1.abstract\n\n[4] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-024-03221-x"

Here the authors train a descrimitive model using different DNA representations as input. It\u2019s obvious that the character level input will do poorly because there is no context window. In modern generative models, there\u2019s a huge context window. It\u2019s difficult to see how this discriminative test translates to the modern generative modeling case. Especially with what is shown in Figure 2c, why not just do that set of experiments for all different DNA tokenizers?\n\nSince the speed of GenomeOcean is strongly advertised, it\u2019d be great to have an ablation study of the improvements that made the model what % faster. All of these are listed in section 3.1. This is a relatively easy experiment to do, because you don\u2019t have to train the model for this; it\u2019s just inference speed.\n\nFor section 4.1 and Table 1, did you hold out those species or even representative genus while training the generative models?\n\nI think the ORF length analysis is quite weak. The Ground Truth should be the dataset the model was trained on, so a comparison of the models can be done. Evo was trained on OpenGenome, which is just prokaryotic sequences. Did you filter in your \u201cground truth\u201d dataset for this? Which did you use?"

Wouldn\u2019t validation loss of some held out sequences make more sense?\n\nWhere is the training loss curve for DNABERT-2?\n\nWhat is the average contig length of the environmental samples taken? Are they assembled genomes, or minimally large contigs? There\u2019s no point of a long-context model if you aren\u2019t training on long contigs. What is the distribution of Kingdoms? There\u2019s probably not a lot of eukaryotic sequences, which is important for many engineering contexts.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if the species identification approach is a good proxy for designing sequences, as you\u2019ve outlined in the intro on the use of these models. It doesn\u2019t matter if the generated sequences adhere to the same species, they just need to be functional. In the case of a protein, you can easily make a transgenic organism that will easily express and fold some foreign protein, even if it isn\u2019t codon optimized for that species.\n\n\u201cFollowing previous works (Kang et al., 2015; Nissen et al., 2021), we measure the closeness of two sequences with the cosine similarity of their tetranucleotide frequency (TNF).\u201d Why not just try to align them?

Several experimental concerns are highlighted below:\n\n- The paper omits any statistical or textual description of the pre-training dataset, other than the method of collection, making it difficult to form intuition about the biological validity of experiments and judge the significance of the method. It is unknown how much of this pre-training dataset (and consequently GenomeOcean) overlaps with existing genome foundation models. As the authors note, the dataset will be released and will likely be an extremely valuable resource for the community, but as it stands it is difficult to assess the paper's contributions in this aspect.\n\n- While the evaluation of common genomic FM modelling decisions is a valuable contribution to the community, the choice to evaluate performance on the Genome Understanding Evaluation benchmark may dilute the insights gained. Based on my understanding of the benchmark from the original paper, the train/val/test splits in the datasets are not made while accounting for homology or sequence similarity. This filtering step is common in other biological domains such as pLMs. Without this step, data leakage may occur, and it becomes unclear whether the models are truly capturing biological function / structure. Consequently, it is unclear whether the modelling decisions in the preliminary experiments contribute towards better representations.\n\n- Although the proposed evaluation metric in Section 4.1 is novel to my knowledge (though perhaps it could be formalized into something resembling the inception score or FID) and interesting from a methodology perspective, using other genomic foundation models as a method to discriminate generated sequences may be a limitation, as the metric would suffer from inherent biases in the existing FMs. This may detract from the metric, given the discourse in community on the overall validity of genomic foundation models. A simple baseline agnostic of existing FMs such as phylogenetic distance between sequences would be interesting to see.\n\n- While the proposed evaluation metrics have a reasonable setup, the tasks evaluated (e.g. species classification) lack strong correlation with the functional validity of the generated sequences, which is highly relevant for real world utility of GenomeOcean in my opinion.\n\n- Minor, but claims in the introduction that genomic foundation models outperform classic supervised models are unsubstantiated. For splice site prediction specifically, **none of the in-line citations provided mention splice site detection.** Moreover, to my knowledge, there has been no comparison of genomic foundation models against more modern splice site predictors, nor on the more realistic splice site prediction task described in SpliceAI / Pangolin. As such, the overall claim may be pre-mature."

Since it was not clear from the text, I am wondering whether the character-level and BPE tokenizers observe the same number of DNA nucleotides during pre-training, or if they observe the same number of input tokens. Due to the high compression factor of BPE, the latter experimental design would allow the BPE model to access a much longer context. If this were the case, we would be assessing the benefits of BPE in terms of computational efficiency rather than any true representational gains as the paper may imply.\n- It is surprising that the Evo model is outperformed by the Reorder baseline, and it would be interesting (but not necessary to the review) to hear if the authors have any insight into this phenomena based on their experiments.\n- It is unclear exactly how the genomic sequences using in Section 4.1 were selected. Were these 2000bp sequences taken from coding regions, or were they taken from randomly sampled positions in the genomes from the dataset? The improvement in performance as a function of sequence length is also unexpected, as one might expect the quality of generated sequence to decrease as a function of length, and I am wondering if the authors could provide intuition on this aspect.\n\nOverall, the paper tackles important and relevant problems in genomic modelling, and I believe the contributions are sufficient for eventual publication given several experimental concerns are addressed or rebutted."
