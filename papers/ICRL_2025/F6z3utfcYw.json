In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of DPO's *convergence rates* with different sampling strategies under the exact gradient setting, revealing a surprising separation: uniform sampling achieves *linear* convergence, while our proposed online sampler achieves *quadratic* convergence.\nWe further adapt the sampler to practical settings by incorporating posterior distributions and *logit mixing*, demonstrating significant improvements over previous approaches.\nOn Safe-RLHF dataset, our method exhibits a $4.5$% improvement over vanilla DPO and a $3.0$% improvement over on-policy DPO;  on Iterative-Prompt, our approach outperforms vanilla DPO, on-policy DPO, and Hybrid GSHF by over $4.2$%.\nOur results not only offer insights into the theoretical standing of DPO but also pave the way for potential algorithm designs in the future.",

However, if not considering posterior distribution, we cannot establish the quadratic convergence when both $\\pi^{s1}$ and $\\pi^{s2}$ are $\\pi_\\theta$ in Definition 3, as the coefficients of each $\\Delta$ in the proof of Theorem 1 would be different, posing significant difficulty in converting $\\Delta (y, y''; \\theta) - \\Delta (y', y''; \\theta)$ to $\\delta (y, y'; \\theta)$, which is the central idea in our proof. The difficulties are similar when we change the distributions in Definitions 4 and 5. But these difficulties inspire us to carefully design the samplers. \n\nBesides, if we view $\\pi_\\theta$ as a posterior distribution on $Y$, we can still have advantages. Please see our answer **[AW2]** for this point.\n\n**[AQ4]** Our results indicate that $\\delta(y,y';\\theta^{(t)})$ for $y,y'$ in $Y$ are simultaneously optimized toward $0$. In Section 5, by the performance difference lemma, we show that $V^*-V^\\theta\\le\\underset{y\\sim\\pi^\\star,y'\\sim\\pi_\\theta}{\\mathbb E}\\delta(y,y';\\theta)\\le\\sqrt{\\underset{y\\sim\\pi^\\star,y'\\sim\\pi_\\theta}{\\mathbb E}\\delta^2(y,y';\\theta)}$, demonstrating that $\\delta(y,y';\\theta)$ contributes more to the performance when the joint probability $\\pi^\\star(y) \\pi_\\theta(y')$ is high. This inspires us to plug a posterior distribution on $Y$, as discussed in **[AW2]**.\n\n**[AQ5]** Please refer to our response to all reviewers: Explanation of evaluation.\n\n**[AQ6]** Please refer to our answer **[AW4]**."

                "value": "**[AW4]** Thank you for your insightful questions! There are generally two points of view in RLHF when evaluating the final performance: 1) KL-regularization is only to stabilize the RLHF training; 2) The goal of RLHF is to balance the reward and KL-divergence from $\\pi_{\\text{ref}}$. For the first view, we provide Tables 2 and 3; and for the second, we provide Figure 2.\n\n*The proposed method outperforms baselines only in large KL divergence. Why?*\n\nThere are two main reasons explaining the advantages that exist mostly in the large KL-divergence regime. 1) The closed-form solution of DPO is the solution of $\\max_{\\pi}\\underset{y\\sim \\pi}{\\mathbb E} r(y)-\\beta\\operatorname{KL}(\\pi \\Vert \\pi_{\\text{ref}})$, or equivalently, $\\max_{\\pi}\\underset{y\\sim\\pi}{\\mathbb{E}}r(y)$ subject to $\\text{KL}(\\pi\\Vert\\pi_{\\text{ref}})\\le C$, where $C$ is a constant induced by duality. When the KL-divergence is small, the policy space is relatively small, and thus the performance won't differ much. 2) Although in theory we are exponentially faster, there may still exist some large constants that slow down the convergence in the first two iterations.\n\n*The improvements in rewards and win-rate appear to be modest.*\n\n**Small advantages are still meaningful.** In Tables 2 and 3, the win-rate improvements might be relatively small but are still acceptable in LLM literature such as [5], especially taking our restricted computation into consideration. Our primary goal is not restricted to showing that our proposed sampler performs best, but is intended to show that **all the cited DPO variants fit into our framework seamlessly**. The results further align with our claims: 1) Vanilla DPO is DPO-Unif with the posterior distribution on $\\mathcal{Y}$ set as $\\pi_{\\text{ref}}^{2\\beta}$, on-policy DPO is DPO-Unif with the posterior distribution on $\\mathcal{Y}$ set as $\\pi_\\theta^{2\\beta}$ (which is closer to $\\pi^\\star$), thus on-policy DPO is better than vanilla DPO; 2) Hybrid-GSHF is approximately DPO-Mix-P (which is better than DPO-Unif) with the posterior distribution on $\\mathcal{Y}$ set as $\\pi_{\\text{ref}}^{\\beta}\\pi_\\theta^{\\beta}$ (which is closer to $\\pi^\\star$), thus Hybrid-GSHF is better than vanilla DPO; 3) Our proposed sampler is DPO-Mix-P with the posterior distribution on $Y$ set as $\\pi_\\theta^{2\\beta}$, and experiments validate that it performs better than all others. We thus believe the benefits indeed exist, as reflected in these experiments.\n\n*Whether the model overfits to the reward model?*\n\nFor the reward overfitting issue, please refer to our response to all reviewers: Explanation of evaluation.\n\n*Whether the comparison is fair?*\n\nWe want to clarify that theoretically all methods should converge to the same optimal solution (though they may still differ in reality), and thus we want our algorithm to obtain a good policy quickly. Now let us rethink the comparison, vanilla DPO cannot obtain a larger (but acceptable) KL quickly, and then the reward increases slowly, while ours quickly achieves a higher reward at a low cost of KL-divergence, indicating that **the comparison is reasonable**: it means ours converges faster than vanilla DPO.\n\n[5] Exploratory Preference Optimization: Harnessing Implicit Q*-Approximation for Sample-Efficient RLHF. https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21046."

If we didn't understand your problem accurately, please don't hesistate to reach out.\n\n**[AW2]** Thank you for the suggestion! Bridging the gap between theory and practice is one of this paper's goals. To clarify this point, we have slightly abused the notation $\\mathcal{Y}$, by viewing it as an action set with a **posterior distribution**.\n\nIt means that we don't need to modify the theory and only need to assume a different posterior distribution on $\\mathcal{Y}$. Then, the theoretical samplers would naturally change as shown in Section 5, \"Setting the Posterior.\" Therefore, $(\\pi_{\\text{ref}}, \\pi_{\\text{ref}})$ is represented by $(\\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y}), \\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y}))$ with a posterior of $\\pi_{\\text{ref}}$. It is similar for other regimes. In other words, our theories mainly focus on the policy difference $\\log\\frac{\\pi^{s1}}{\\pi^{s2}}$ between the heterogeneous samplers (since we can eliminate the $\\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y})$ in policy difference like $\\log\\frac{\\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y})}{\\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y})}=\\log\\frac{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}}=0$). To align our theory to practice, a concern would be that which posterior distribution is more useful and practical? In Section 5, we show that $\\pi^\\star$ would be a good one, but $\\pi^\\star$ is too costly to obtain, as shown in [1], we thus plug $\\pi_\\theta^{2\\beta}$ as a compromise (this may lose a bit theoretical soundness since $\\pi_\\theta$ is not fixed, but it works well in practice).\n\nFor the explanation of the mixing coefficients, please refer to our response to all reviewers: Explanation of sampler design.\n\n**[AW3]** We agree with this point. As cited in Section 2, there are some works [2][3][4] studying policy gradient methods with access to exact gradients that have obtained impactful results. Inspired by this line of work, we believe our theoretical findings can serve as a useful starting point, motivating the community to further explore the empirical setting. Therefore, we provide Theorems 5 and 6 for an initial understanding of empirical DPO algorithms.\n\n[1] Statistical Rejection Sampling Improves Preference Optimization. https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06657.\n\n[2] On the global convergence rates of softmax policy gradient methods.

We agree with your concern regarding small response spaces and bandit setting, and have already listed it as a future direction (limitation 2) in Section 6. A starting point would be **log-linear parameterization**, where the reward is parameterized as $r(y) = r^\\top \\phi(y)$, and the policy is parameterized as $\\pi_\\theta(y) \\propto \\exp(\\theta^\\top\\phi(y))$. Here, we assume the dimension $d$ is much smaller than the response space, and $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the unknown reward vector, $\\phi(y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the feature vector, and $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the policy parameter we want to learn. We've found that, if the covariance matrix $\\sum_{y,y'}(\\phi(y)-\\phi(y'))(\\phi(y)-\\phi(y'))^\\top$ is full rank, then we can learn the optimal policy parameter $\\theta^\\star = \\theta_{\\text{ref}} + r/\\beta$. Thus, we don't need to loop over all possible actions: if we have a small amount of responses $y_1, \\ldots, y_m$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^m (\\phi(y_i)-\\phi(y_j))(\\phi(y_i)-\\phi(y_j))^\\top$ is full-rank, then it suffices for policy learning. Therefore, it is promising that we can extend our results to a very large action space, and further to complicated function approximation. We will add this discussion in the revision.\n\n**[W2]** *It would be useful to see some errors bars/confidence bounds to get a sense for whether the improvement the authors find is significant.*\n\n**[AW2]** We agree with this point, and will elaborate our tables in the revision.

For now, we cannot prove that this mixed sampler is optimal by providing lower bounds, nor can we devise a scheme with faster convergence (like $\\delta^{(t+1)} \\le 0.9 |\\delta^{(t)}|^{2.1}$). This is a valuable direction for future work. However, achieving quadratic convergence is already non-trivial in the optimization theory literature.\n\n**[AW3]** Our main contribution lies in the theoretical part (we are the first to show a theoretical gap in using samplers in RLHF from the perspective of optimization, a significant topic), and the experiments are designed to demonstrate the potential of our framework, as restricted by limited computing resources.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\n**[AQ1]** Although we have not provided a theoretical lower bound on uniform DPO under the empirical setting, which we would like to leave as an open problem, we can offer an intuitive explanation for this point. Refer to Section 4.1.1 and Appendix A.1.1, where we demonstrate the linear convergence of DPO-Unif. To do so, we need to establish a lower bound $\\sigma_{\\min}'$ on $\\sigma'(\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y)\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y')}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y)\\pi_\\theta(y')})$, after which the convergence rate becomes $2-8\\sigma_{\\min}'$. Note that $\\sigma'(x)$ decreases as $\\vert x\\vert$ increases, thus we need to upper bound $\\vert\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y)\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y')}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y)\\pi_\\theta(y')}\\vert$. However, when faced with noisy gradients, $\\vert\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y)\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y')}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y)\\pi_\\theta(y')}\\vert$ might deviate significantly when $\\eta=\\frac{1}{\\beta A}$, and then it cannot converge as fast as DPO-Mix-R or DPO-Mix-P*. Note that the approach to circumvent $\\sigma'_{\\min}$ in the proof for DPO-Mix-P* is not applicable here. Moreover, in numerical simulation experiments shown in Figures 1 and 4 (Appendix D.1), we find that our proposed samplers consistently outperform DPO-Unif significantly under empirical settings. Thus, we believe our method is more efficient than DPO-Unif empirically."

                "value": "As multiple reviewers have asked about the intuition behind our sampler design, including heterogeneous samplers and mixed sampler pairs, we address this inquiry here. We will add more discussion in the revision.\n\nGenerally, our theoretical findings show that these two components are both critical for quadratic convergence. For the design of DPO-Mix-R, refer to our statement above Theorem 3: for faster convergence, we need $\\pi^s\\propto 1/\\sigma'(r(y_1)-r(y_2))$. Note that $1/\\sigma'(r(y_1)-r(y_2))=2+\\exp(r(y_1)-r(y_2))+\\exp(r(y_2)-r(y_1))$; we thus need to mix two sampler pairs, one for $1+1$, and one for $\\exp(r(y_1))\\exp(-r(y_2))+\\exp(r(y_2))\\exp(-r(y_1))$ (the heterogeneous sampler pair). This also holds for DPO-Mix-P. Below, we will talk more about each of them.\n\n**Design of heterogeneous samplers:** When we know the reward, we intuitively want the win response distribution $\\pi^{s1}$ to have a positive correlation with the reward (and vice versa for the lose response distribution $\\pi^{s2}$), and thus we design DPO-Mix-R. The exact justification can be found in Appendix A.2, as this combination cancels out the coefficient of the linear term. When we cannot know the reward (as in practice), $\\beta\\log\\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y)}$ can work as a surrogate/approximation of reward $r(y)$ (which is a well-known fact in DPO literature), and thus we design DPO-Mix-P. There have been many works studying which kind of samplers to use in DPO, and the conclusion of the most representative one [1] fits our design well: the claim in its Section 5.2 shows that the sampler pair should have a policy difference. Furthermore, as stated in [6], people may use heuristic samplers like different temperatures, or best/worst-of-N tricks. Our work makes the choice of policy difference more flexible, which is enabled by logit mixing as shown in our Section 5.\n\n**Effectiveness of mixing two sampler pairs:** Moreover, we have conducted extensive ablation experiments included in Appendix D.1. Specifically, we study each component (namely, \u2460 and \u2461) in the mixture of sampler pairs, and the results are in Figures 5 and 6. The conclusion is that, in practice, solely using the online samplers (\u2461) is consistently weaker than the mixture in all instances, indicating the effectiveness of our novel strategy.\n\n**Explanation of the sampling coefficient $\\alpha$:** When we mix two different sampler pairs, like \u2460 and \u2461 in DPO-Mix-R (Definition 4), the mixing ratio should be carefully set to obtain quadratic convergence (which, in theory, should be $\\alpha_1:\\alpha_2 = |\\mathcal Y|^2:\\sum_{y,y'}\\exp(r(y)-r(y'))$). Since we use **two** sampler pairs in DPO-Mix-R, $\\alpha_1$ is changed to $|\\mathcal Y|^2$ in Def. 4 from $2|\\mathcal Y|^2$ in Def. 3, to make it a fair comparison. We can view DPO-Unif as a mixture of two identical sampler pairs, each pair being $(\\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y}), \\text{Uniform}(\\mathcal{Y}))$, with weights $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = |\\mathcal Y|^2$ (so their sum is $2|\\mathcal Y|^2$).\n\n[1] Iterative Preference Learning from Human Feedback: Bridging Theory and Practice for RLHF under KL-Constraint. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11456."

For empirical DPO, how to compare the efficiency with the uniform DPO since the empirical DPO is the practical one.The paper titled \"The Crucial Role of Samplers in Online Direct Preference Optimization\" explores Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for aligning language models (LMs) with human preferences. While DPO is recognized for stability and efficiency, the authors focus on its convergence properties under different sampling methods. The study reveals that standard uniform sampling achieves only linear convergence, while their proposed samplers (DPO-Mix-R and DPO-Mix-P) attain faster, quadratic convergence. These findings are validated through experiments on the Safe-RLHF and Iterative-Prompt datasets, where the proposed methods outperform traditional DPO and on-policy sampling, showing improvements in model alignment with human preferences."

The mixed samplers in definition 4&5 differ from standard samplers in two aspects: first they consider a heterogenous sampling scheme (enhancer) that increases the difference between the positive completion and the negative completion, second they mix the heterogenous sampling scheme with the standard (homogenous) sampling scheme using some nontrivial  mixing coefficient. In the theoretical study, it is shown that the two aspects combined have certain benefits. However, overall there is a lack of analysis of the contributions from each individual aspect. In a certain sense, this weakness diminishes the convincingness of the theory and limits its usage in practice. Certain ablation studies or analyses that isolate the effects of the heterogeneous sampling scheme and the mixing strategy separately would resolve this concern.\n2. While I largely agree with table 2, there are still some gaps between the theoretical samplers in definition 4&5 and the practical ones. In particular, the first sampler in definition 4&5 are uniform over Y, but in practice no-one would use uniform distributions. Moreover, the mixing coefficients $\\alpha_2,\\alpha_2$ are set somewhat ad hoc but without explanation.\n3. The main theoretical result is in the exact setting, which is a bit far from practice.\n4. There is a lack of explanation/justification of the results of the LLM experiments. In table 2 & 3, the improvements in rewards and win-rate appear to be modest. Combining figure 2, it can be observed that the benefit of the proposed method mostly occurs in later iterations, or equivalently, in the large KL-divergence regime. It then brings the question of whether the model overfits to the reward model and whether the comparison is fair. See the question section for more comments.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this paper has some good new ideas but lack enough support or evidence. From an optimistic principle, I lean towards acceptance since I believe this work can potentially be significantly enhanced by addressing my concerns and questions."

In its original form, online DPO samples both responses in the pair directly from the trained policy.

The authors show the following results for a simplified \"bandit\" setting where there are no contexts and the response space is small/finite.\n\n- In the absence of statistical errors (\"exact DPO\"), uniform sampling converages at a linear rate (which the authors prove is tight), whereas two non-trivial sampling strategies the authors propose (\"DPO-Mix-R\" and \"DPO-Mix-P\"), which involve mixing the learned policy based on a reward model or reference policy, achieve faster quadratic convergence.\n- With statistical errors, DPO-Mix-R and DPO-Mix-P still converge to the noise level at a linear rate.\n\nThe authors also support these theoretical findings with empirical results."
