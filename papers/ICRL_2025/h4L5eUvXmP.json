    "title": "From Patches to Graphs: Towards Image Diffusion Models with GNNs",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality image generation, typically using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) as backbone architectures. However, CNNs may struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, while ViTs can be computationally intensive due to their attention mechanisms. We propose the Diffusion Image GNN (DiG), a novel architecture that leverages graph-based modeling within diffusion models. By representing image patches as nodes in a graph and connecting them based on spatial relationships, DiG efficiently captures both local and global dependencies and naturally handles multi-scale features. \nEmpirical results demonstrate that DiG achieves competitive Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first application of graph neural networks as a backbone within diffusion models for image generation, opening new avenues for research in generative modeling.",

With the widespread application of large models, the computational overhead of attention mechanisms such as Vit is no longer the most important limitation, and GNN's performance is not as good as Vit in some aspects. In addition, there have been many studies on computational efficiency.\n2. The quantitative experimental results in Table 2 show that the performance of the proposed method is much lower than that of the visual model based on the attention mechanism. I doubt the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. The explanation of the results is not in-depth enough: In the table and image comparison, the generation effect of the DiG model has improved, but the author lacks in-depth explanation of the specific reasons for these improvements. For example, in the quantitative evaluation, is the improvement in the FID score due to the use of multi-scale graphs? How do the characteristics of graph neural networks affect the generation effect? \u200b\u200bIt is recommended that the author provide a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results to better explain the actual contribution of each component."

Do the authors have an insight into why is that? \n- One thing that I would love to get some insight into is why would this model would do better than a heirarchical architecture like say UNET or even something like a Swin Transformer based baseline, that uses CNNs. Given patches of certain size, keeping the 2D structure and adding extra kernels (using CNNs) at different hierarchies should ideally have the same effect as a local GCN layer acting at different levels of Heirarchical. \n\t- Would really appreciate that the authors also compare their method with diffusion models trained with these backbones.\n- A lot of the experiments are shown on relatively small images (maximum size is 64x64) so it is unclear how well the method would scale with higher image size."

Furthermore, when compared to ViT methods with a similar number of parameters or computational complexity, DiG's performance lags significantly, contradicting the authors' claim of comparable effectiveness. \n\nAnd this trend is consistent across other datasets, as present in Table 2."
