    "title": "Truth or Deceit? A Bayesian Decoding Game Enhances Consistency and Reliability",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce outputs that --  though plausible -- can lack consistency and reliability, particularly in ambiguous or complex scenarios. Challenges arise from ensuring that outputs align with both factual correctness and human intent. This is problematic in existing approaches that trade improved consistency for lower accuracy. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach to enhance consistency and reliability during the decoding stage of LLM output generation. Our method models the decoding process as a multistage Bayesian decoding game. This ensures consistency through \\textit{Correctness Alignment} and enhances reliability via \\textit{Ambiguity Calibration}. The model dynamically converges to a consensus on the most reliable outputs and distinguishes \\{Valid}, Specious}\\} outputs without human feedback or additional training. Remarkably, our game design allows smaller models to outperform much larger models through game mechanisms (\\textit{e.g.} 78.1 LLaMA13B \\textit{vs} 76.6 PaLM540B), as well as integrating various LL strategies and models, demonstrating the potential of game-theoretic tools to improve the truthfulness and reliability of LLMs.",

                "value": "This work presents a novel approach to improving Large Language Model (LLM) outputs through game theory. Bayesian decoding game(BDG) structures the decoding process as a Bayesian signaling game between two players: a generator and a verifier. Through this game-based framework, the authors aim to address the common issue of LLMs generating outputs that, while plausible, may lack factual correctness or mislead human evaluators due to ambiguity.\n\nThe BDG model leverages Correctness Alignment and Ambiguity Calibration, allowing for more reliable outputs. This game mechanism enables smaller models to achieve performance levels that surpass much larger models by aligning generator and verifier responses through iterative signaling, without needing additional training or human feedback.\n\nBDG demonstrates rapid convergence and stability compared to the Equilibrium Consensus Game (ECG), a related game-theoretic model, and outperforms it in benchmarks like ARC and MMLU. BDG also outpaces alternative methods like Generative Ranking and Discriminative Ranking, yielding higher consistency, reliability, and accuracy.\n\nThrough experiments, BDG is shown to be computationally efficient and capable of handling a variety of tasks (e.g., MCQA, ethics scenarios, and medical datasets) while maintaining high performance. The framework\u2019s adaptability also allows it to be combined with techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting.\n\nThe BDG framework demonstrates strong potential in scenarios where human evaluation may overlook subtle errors in LLM output, as it systematically reduces inconsistencies and enhances the legibility and truthfulness of model outputs."

                "value": "I admit that I could not make sense of a large amount of the text in this paper\u2014I find the writing _extremely_ vague and confusing. The developments in the appendix (e.g., Appendix C) were much clearer to me. Some examples from the main text:\n\nFirst, the introduction is full of vague expressions like the follows:\n  * \"dynamic and rigorous verifier\"\n  * \"our work focuses on actual consistency in _correctness_ and calibrated ambiguity in _reliability_\"\n  * \"Instead of absolute reliability, we aim to identify false negative and false positive samples that exhibit fluctuating or unstable behavior under calibrated confidence and disambiguity metrics\"\nthese may be interpretable in a way that is technically correct, but the reader is ill-equipped to guess at their meaning. What is the difference between consistency, correctness, reliability, and calibrated confidence? What do you mean by fluctuating or unstable behavior? (fluctuating or unstable as what varies?) Later in the paper when these terms appear again, including in results and figures, they are not defined or illustrated. A single worked-through example would go a long way.\n\nNext, the math prose is incredibly hard to follow. Consider Definition 4.\n> Definition 4. (Disambiguity Metric) For a prompt $x$ and a finite set of answer candidate $\\mathcal{Y}$, a Disambiguity Metric is a function that projects the prompt $x$ and a candidate $y_i \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ such that $DA(x, y): x \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\to [0, 1]$. The output of the function is a measurement of the disambiguation of $y_i \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ to the prompt $x$. The disambiguity metric, combined with the correctness parameter, can detect false-positive and false-negative classifications in the correctness alignment phase.\n\nAll I can detect that has been said here is the type signature of the metric. Nowhere can I identify how it is computed, what it is supposed to relate to, or why we believe that it can detect false-positive or false-negative classifications, nor is it clear what model is doing those classifications and how we know they're false. It says the function DA is a \"measurement of the disambiguation of $y_i \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ to the prompt $x$\", but what does that mean? I can't figure it out. This is the one part that needed to be written out as mathematics, and it is not, unless I'm missing something.\n\nThe first six pages of the paper are like this. The experimental section is a bit better in this respect but not much: the figures have a lot of content which is not explained, key metrics like \"consistency\" are not defined as far as I can tell. I also actually just couldn't figure out what the verifier policy is supposed to be or how it is initialized, until I read Appendix C.\n\nWhile I feel only weakly confident in my ability to assess the strength of the contribution behind this paper, I feel quite confident that it is not ready for publication because of the issues in the paper's writing and communication. I would look to the work this is building on \u2014 Jacob et al. (2024), https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09139 \u2014 as an example of a way of writing a similar paper with more clarity."

                "value": "My main concerns about the work are regarding the presentation and framing. Mainly, the paper is quite hard to understand and it is not clear what the contributions are wrt. related works:\n\n- Some of the terms are fairly unclear and could benefit from an earlier intuitive explanation, for example, \"calibrated ambiguity\" (L73). Also, for example, the authors mention NLP metrics and perplexity in L260-L264 but never introduce them (for the latter, this would be easier if also P_LM was introduced properly, which also is called P_LLM at other places).\n\n- The paper is not very accessible to an audience that is not familiar with game-theory, for example, the term strategy profile is never really formally introduced. The paper also lacks a good description of what a language model actually is and what it means for it to be used as a generator or discriminator. In my opinion, the paper would benefit significantly from aligning notations and terminology between what is common in the LLM and game-theory community.\n\n- The paper is unnecessarily written in complex language at many stages, for example, L76-79.\n\n- In L138 you mention that you \"propose improvements to address limitations\". However, it is not clear what limitations are meant and especially, whether those are limitations of Jacob et al. 2024. If they are, it would be very important to make clear how they are addressed and how they arise in their method. There is only a short comparison of how the methods differ in Table 1 which to me is not sufficient.\n\n- Overall, I am having troubles identifiying based on the main paper what the contributions of the authors are in terms of the algorithm wrt. to Jacob et al. 2024 and what is more of a formalization of their method. This needs to be made clear in my opinion."

                "value": "- The term LL strategies (L23) sounds a bit awkward and is non-standard, maybe this should rather be rewritten, as it is also not clear what is meant. If it is decoding algorithm, then this should be preferred.\n\n- If the utility of human feedback is so constrained (Introduction), then why is it a good idea to introduce a further proxy of it to solve the problems that stem from using it? I see the point for scalability but why would, for example, solve problems with interpretability?\n\n- It's not easy to distinguish valid from specious based on Figure 1, maybe a more intuitive example would help, as two of them appear to rely on domain (medical) knowledge?\n\n- Citation broken in L92\n\n- Why exactly is disambiguity so desirable and what does it concretely mean? I think it would help if this was made clear.\n\n- Figure 3 is very hard to parse, so is Figure 4 (esp. b.2)"
