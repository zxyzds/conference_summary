    "abstract": "Memory is the foundation of all human activities; without memory, it would be nearly impossible for people to perform any task in daily life. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current practice, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on the memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\u00f6dinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.",

                "value": "While I found the work to be commendable in its ambition and scope, and I respect the authors for reasoning about memory from first-principles, a condition for acceptance should be correctness, an extensive literature review, and proper contextualization of the current work.\n\nHere is a non-extensive list I recommend for literature review:\n\n1. Carlini et al, 2022: https://openreview.net/forum?id=TatRHT_1cK \\\nAlthough the authors criticize this paper, I would say that has a truly actionable definition of memory, which is then thoroughly tested. I would model the structure of your paper after their setup.\n\n2. Neuroscience: \\\nThe authors raise some questions, e.g. \"does a neuron in the brain store a word or a whole sentence?\", among others that I won't list, that imply a lack of due diligence with the neuroscience literature. I would recommend reading about (1) biologically plausible learning algorithms, such as Hebbian learning, spiking neural networks, etc; and also (2) concept decoding from neural signals, e.g., https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15804-w . In particular, there is no evidence in the neurolinguistics literature that single neurons store entire words and sentences; further, it is unclear what is meant by sentences like \"weight parameters in our brains\". Sentences like these should use the correct terminology, e.g., do you mean synaptic weights? from the neuroscience literature and cite sources; I would start by looking up \"developmental plasticity\".\n\nOverall, I strongly agree with Reviewer 1's assessment. While I don't foresee raising my score, I hope that you don't feel discouraged by the rebuttal, and I recommend these steps to improve the quality of the paper for a future resubmission:\n\n1. _Writing in an academic style._ This involves tempering claims, supporting each one with a citation if possible, supporting speculative remarks with experimental evidence. Using proper terminology (e.g. removing \"weight parameters in our brains\"). Statements like \"Each update may be right or wrong, but with a vast number of humans exploring the world, we gradually inch closer to the truth, ultimately leading to innovation.\" are, for instance, not appropriate for academic writing. The reason is that the goal of academic writing is to put evidence towards a claim, and sentences like these detract from this goal. To get a better idea of an appropriate style, I would read past machine learning papers.\n\n2. _An extensive literature review._ Before engaging with ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience, it's important to read up on the current literature before claiming things like \"no one can definitively explain these [neural] phenomena\"; without acknowledging the work that has been done towards an explanation. A better lit review is crucial to see that statements like \"does a single neuron store a word, or does it store an entire sentence?\" don't belong in a paper related to neuroscience; questions like these are never asked in the literature because overwhelming evidence suggests it's not true.\n\n3. _Better connection between theory and experiment._ As elaborated in my previous comments and by other reviewers.\n\nLastly, as R1 suggested, I would suggest submitting a version of this work to a workshop or try presenting it at local symposia to get academic mentorship. A lot of paper writing is about appropriate framing and contextualization with previous work; this is what mentors are for!"

For instance, is memory a function from inputs to outputs? Is it a function from (inputs, outputs) to a truth value? The authors go on to use next-token prediction accuracy as their metric for memory in Section 4. I suggest the authors to formally define memory in the next version of the manuscript.\n\n### First, we should clarify that our definitions here are specifically targeted at LLMs and human memory.\n\n### Regarding the references suggested by the reviewer, they are simply assigned different terms in specific contexts. Memory can indeed be referred to by many different terms.\n\n### In response to the reviewer's question: \"Is memory a function from inputs to outputs?\" We have clearly stated in the paper that memory in LLMs involves dynamic approximation based on inputs. We provided the corresponding mathematical model in Section 2.2. I would like to ask why memory cannot be defined as a dynamic fitting function from inputs to outputs."

You view memory as an empirical question, while I believe that memory can fundamentally be expressed mathematically. \n\nLet me explain why I hold this view:\n\nFirst, the initial neural network can be considered a perceptron, which was designed based on human neurons. However, due to subsequent changes in form, it is no longer seen as having a direct relationship with the brain. In my work, I reconnect deep learning with the brain, and therefore, I believe that whether considering the original design principles of neural networks or the phenomena exhibited by modern LLMs, they can be regarded as simulations of the brain."

Memory is more than overfitting, we can generalize when we retrieve information from memory, while overfitting, by definition, is associated with poor generalization. b) Regardless of the relationship between memory and overfitting, running a new experiment to show that LLMs can overfit is neither novel nor valuable (it's an extremely well-known fact already).\n\n**A:**  a) First, we never claimed that memory is necessarily overfitting. Instead, we use the overfitting phenomenon in LLMs to illustrate the concept of memory. Second, to some extent  our brains are overfitting to the real world we encounter, and the resulting phenomenon is generalization. \n\nFor example, why can't an expert in mathematics generalize from one or two examples to the entire field of physics? While this example is somewhat extreme, a simpler one illustrates the point better: why can't a long-distance runner with excellent jumping ability achieve the same jumping standards as a professional jumper after just one or two training sessions? The reason is that they need to overfit to the specific task. \n\nThe key point is that because we overfit to the real world, the result appears as generalization. \n\n**A:**  b) Our goal has never been to overfit; rather, our goal is to explain the phenomenon of memory."

In my paper, I clearly state that the hippocampus acts as a switch for long-term memory, not as a database. If it were a database, individuals with hippocampal damage would lose their long-term memories entirely. However, he still retains his long-term memories, which supports my argument.

The mathematical description needs to predict new, unexpected empirical data to be valuable (think Einstein's prediction of Mercury's perihelion), or to simplify the description of some known models/observations (e.g. Newton's first-principles explanations of planetary motion). Unfortunately, your paper only provides a new way to formalize already known phenomena, but it does not offer and meaningful simplifications or insightful predictions.\n\nFirst, thank you for your guidance. I have learned a lot from this review, your comments and those of many other reviewers are very valuable, and I will correct them later.\n\n1. To begin, since the issue is complex, I\u2019ll first present a viewpoint and then address your question. I\u2019m not certain if my explanation below will clearly convey my thoughts, but **I want to emphasize that this is purely an academic discussion, with no intention whatsoever of contradicting your perspective.**\n\n2.  **Viewpoint 1**: The human brain can be considered a large, dynamic fitting function, continually adjusting its internal \"weights\" through interaction with the real world. In this process, some of these adaptations are accurate, while others are not. However, since these adjustments are grounded in real-world experience, whether correct or incorrect, they remain bounded by the constraints of reality. For instance, people cannot imagine something they have never encountered in some form. Take Picasso, for example: while his work is regarded as innovative, it\u2019s possible that it simply stemmed from his exposure to distorted perspectives through mirrors or other natural distortions, which he then exaggerated and developed into his distinctive style. Yet fundamentally, his work did not transcend the bounds of his experiences with reality.\n\n **Viewpoint 2**: It\u2019s important to emphasize that the second viewpoint also describes the way the brain processes thoughts; it\u2019s absolutely not directed at you personally, as I am one of those who experiences this phenomenon too. Because our brains learn based on interactions with the real world, we develop our own \"fixed weights\" through extensive learning, creating an equation like *y = f(x)*. This means that if others have a different perspective or produce a different output from the same input, we tend to reject their viewpoint. This is also why it\u2019s often difficult to persuade others to see things our way.\n\n**Anwers**\uff1a When you refer to the \u201cdescription of some known models/observations,\u201d why can\u2019t this mathematical model serve as a representation or simplification of the brain itself? In many ways, LLMs already seem remarkably close to human cognitive processes, and we have here provided a mathematical description alongside a comparison to memory phenomena in the brain."

Isn't human memory also an example of Schrodinger's Memory? We have no other way of finding out whether a human has a specific memory other than presenting certain stimuli and recording reactions.\n\n#### Moreover, some aspects of the Schrodinger's experiment analogy don't work: for example, the memory is not in an indeterminate state before querying. Moreover, the act of querying (observing) does not affect the memory in the same way as the wave function is affected in quantum experiments.\n\n### Here, when we refer to Schr\u00f6dinger's memory, we mean that the existence of memory can only be determined after a specific stimulus, and until then, it remains uncertain. This is not to suggest that memory is a superposition state as in quantum mechanics.\n\n### Moreover, memory is in an uncertain state for both external observers and the individual who possesses the memory, because it can only be confirmed after a specific stimulus. For example, if I don\u2019t ask you about your first experience eating an apple, would you recall it during the review process? If you don\u2019t recall it, how can you determine whether you have that memory?"

                "value": "Unfortunately, the article suffers from several shortcomings that I will point out section-wise:\n\n\nIntroduction: \n\nOverall, the main topic of the article should be clarified. There needs to be a proper section on related work to outline and delineate current research on this topic so that readers know what the state-of-the-art is and why this paper's contributions are contributions in the first place. This would also help readers unfamiliar with the topic to navigate the article more efficiently. Also, a large portion of the article is concerned with the Transformer architecture, but the original paper is not cited.\n\n\n\nUAT and LLMs:\n\nOverall, the formulation of the theoretical background severely lacks precision and formalism. A significant portion of the notation has not been defined (for example, $C(I_n)$) before using it. Furthermore, the authors write (starting in line 095/096):\n \n\u201c[...] then a finite sum of the following form: [...] is dense in $C(I_n)$\u201d\n\nHowever, \"a finite sum\" can not be dense in the set of continuous functions on the hypercube (which is meant by $C(I_n)$). The authors then continue to reference the article by Wang & Li (2024b), stating (line 131):\n\n\"[...] parameters in the multi-head attention mechanism are modified dynamically in response to the input.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether this refers to the forward or backward process. Overall, the entire section is very confusing, with statements like (starting in line 137):\n\n\"[...] the UAT's parameters are fixed once training is completed, [...]\"\n\n\"UAT\" stands for Universal Approximation Theorem - what is meant by parameters?\n\nA large portion of section 2.1 is very similar to the beginning of Section 2 of the paper by Wang & Li (2024b) (who also do not cite the original transformer paper). As an example, the error in line 102 is the same ($\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ needs to be $\\theta_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$).  \n\nFinally, the reference \"(Cybenko, 2007)\" refers to the article published in 1989 (the same year Hornik et al. published their paper) - is this reference incorrect?\n\n\n\nThe Memory of LLMs:\n\nThis section discusses memory for humans and LLMs and introduces the authors' definition of memory. They criticise other works for the lack of a fundamental theoretical framework and vague definitions of memory (see line 059 and following), but the definition presented in this work seems no different in these regards. The authors should tie their definition to the introduced theory in the previous section and make the formulation more rigorous.\n\nOverall, there is no cited work (apart from the Wikipedia definition) in Section 3.1, which seems more like a blog post than an academic article. This leaves statements like (line 168)\n\n\"The brain does not have a structure analogous to a database for storing information.\"\n\nunfounded. \n\nThe datasets are attributed to \"Unknown\" - although the Huggingface user accounts are available via the provided links.\n\nThe authors calculate the mean average accuracy to evaluate the models' ability to recall poems. However, it is unclear when a poem counts as predicted correctly. Did the authors employ plain string matching? If so, how are newline characters and translations by spaces handled? \n\nFurthermore, most training details are missing. For example, what were the learning rate and batch size? Based on the provided information, no experiments are reproducible (no code is available).\n\nRegarding Table 1: What do the hyphens stand for?\n\nThe authors also claim in line 253/254 that\u2014based on the results in Table 1\u2014\" LLMs possess memory capabilities, which align precisely with the definition of memory we established.\"\n\nIn my view, the authors seem to reduce memory to a capability every overfitted LLM can develop: reproducing tokens in order. Here, I use the term \"overfitted\" as training for 100 epochs on such a comparatively small corpus of text (2000 poems) seems excessive.\n\nFinally, given the same input, if the LLM could reproduce the poems in reversed order, starting with the last token (or character) and ending with the first token (or character) - would this count as memory according to the provided definition and would the metric in Equation (4) reflect this?\n\n\n\nA Comparison Between Human Brains and LLMs:\n\nSimilar to Section 3.1, the discussion about similarities and differences between human memory and memory in LLMs at the beginning of the fourth section lacks academic references and empirical evidence to support claims such as (line 373/374)\n\n\u201cThese poems are not stored in specific areas within the model; they are dynamically generated based on input.\u201d\n\nand (line 395)\n\n\u201cAlthough the predictions in Figure 3 are incorrect, they still align with linguistic conventions and somewhat correspond to the titles of the poems. This can be seen as creativity.\u201d\n\nSome related articles discuss the case of Henry Molaison, which led to the authors hypothesising about similar dynamics for LLMs, but these are likewise unfounded. In particular, I do not see sufficient evidence for the third contribution mentioned in the introduction.  \n\nThe authors likewise state in line 082 that they\n\n\u201c[...] conduct a comprehensive analysis of human and LLM abilities, with a focus on memory ability.\u201d, \n\nwhich I also do not see provided.\n\n\n\nOverall, the article severely lacks formalism, experimental details and references/experiments to support the author's claims. The introduced definition of memory needs to be improved, that is, sharpened, theoretically motivated and empirically justified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor: \n\nGrammar and spelling mistakes need to be corrected, for example:\n\nLine 137: \u201cThis ability enables the Transformer to adaptively fit based on the input [...]\u201d\n\nLine 219: \u201cWe select the poems from datasets and the requirement is the combined length of the input and output to a maximum of 256 characters.\u201d\n\nLine 241/242: \u201c[...] are the prediction and ground true of the i-th exmple.\u201d\n\nLine 351/352: \u201cAfter fine-tuning the model for 100 epochs on CN Poems, the results are shown in Table 2.\u201d\n\nLine 406/407: \u201cThe larger and higher the quality of dataset, the stronger [...]\u201d"

While the goal of Section 3.1 is to define memory, the definition provided is imprecise. For instance, is memory a function from inputs to outputs? Is it a function from (inputs, outputs) to a truth value? The authors go on to use next-token prediction accuracy as their metric for memory in Section 4. I suggest the authors to formally define memory in the next version of the manuscript. \n\n2. The work presented is quite speculative, and the tone of writing imo would be better aligned to a non-ML conference.\n\t1. Section 3, especially 3.1, reads to be long-winded and imprecise-- while it tries to define memory, it instead provides many examples without a formal definition of memory.\n\t2. Section 4, which compares brains to LMs, does not cite the relevant literature on neuroscience (except for one case study in l427). \n\t3. l424 \"Each update may be right or wrong, but with a vast number of humans exploring the world, we gradually inch closer to the truth, ultimately leading to innovation.\" This line (and similar ones) should ideally be toned down or omitted for a machine learning conference.\n\n3. The work does not engage with the vast literature on memory in neuroscience, cognitive science and machine learning. Instead, it overinterprets and over-draws parallels between neural networks and human cognition.

If the answer is \"I do not know\", then it could be that the person never learned Newton's first law.\n\n4. Methodology\n\t1. The selected poems are common ones likely found in training data, especially for the Chinese language models. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that each poem is trained on the same number of times (t=100 epochs). How do you disentangle the effects from pre-training on these poems?\n\t2. The memorization metric based on accuracy is not sufficiently different from Carlini et al 2022, which defines memorization as $k$-extractability, $k$ being the number of tokens in the input prompt. \n\t3. The connection between experiments and UAT is never made.\n\n5. Several unsubstantiated claims about linguistics\n\t1. l271 \"Chinese is a more complex language\" is vague-- I would remove this sentence altogether or specify exactly which components of Chinese are more complex than English with citations from the linguistic typology literature.\n\t2. l214-215 is rather abrupt and would go better in the introduction of the section. The second sentence \"Now, we believe that LLMs also exhibit memory\"-- needs citation\n\n6.

(3) to the observed memory performance in the experiments.  \n3.Section 3.3 proposes using memory ability as an objective measure of LLM capabilities but does not relate this metric to standard benchmarks. The authors should demonstrate how their memory assessment correlates with or complements existing evaluation methods.  \n4.The output length effect analysis in Section 3.4 only tests up to 512 characters. The authors should investigate how memory performance degrades with sequence length and compare this with theoretical predictions from their UAT framework.   \n5.The paper fails to examine an essential aspect of memory systems - their ability to recognize unknown information. Specifically, there are no experiments testing whether models can reliably indicate when they encounter previously unseen poems, nor is there a comparison between \"memorized\" vs. \"hallucinated\" outputs' characteristics. The paper could benefit from adding specific experimental designs to test the models' ability to distinguish between known and unknown information. This might be achieved by including a set of previously unseen poems in the test set, or evaluating how the models distinguish between known and unknown information.  \n6.The experiments only measure binary success (correct/incorrect recitation) without examining the deviations as metioned in Section 3.1.  \n7.The comparison between human and LLM memory is largely speculative and lacks scientific rigor. Many claims about human memory mechanisms are made without proper citations or empirical support. This could be improved by designing experiments to more rigorously compare human and LLM memory, perhaps drawing on established methods from cognitive psychology."

                "value": "1.How do you justify that the UAT format in Equation 3 specifically relates to memory rather than a general dynamic fitting argument? For instance, are there specific properties of UAT that correspond to the characteristics of memory, such as retention, retrieval, or even forgetting? How would you define these aspects mathematically within the UAT framework?  \n2.Which specific aspects of memory can the theoretical framework of UAT explain better than standard Transformer-based fitting capabilities?  \n3.Can you provide theoretical bounds or guarantees for the memory capacity of LLMs based on your UAT analysis?  \n4.How does the proposed memory assessment method account for different types of memory (e.g., factual vs. procedural)?  \n5.Memory typically involves not only retention but also changes in recall accuracy over time or with repeated exposure to new information. Did you investigate how memory in LLMs degrades or strengthens with time, additional training, or varying contexts?"
