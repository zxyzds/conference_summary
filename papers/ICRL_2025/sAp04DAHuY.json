    "title": "DISCO: Mitigating Bias in Deep Learning with Conditional DIStance COrrelation",
    "abstract": "During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up with\nthe final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When predicting\nobjects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be correlated to\ndifferent targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model might use these\nsignals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A predictor that uses\nlighting conditions instead of real object-specific details is obviously undesirable.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model\n(SAM) that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways\ninfluencing our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier\nsatisfying a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the\ndirect causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the\nremaining variables. Finally, we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy\nthat uses conditional distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence\nin regression tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in\ndifferent bias mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical\nkernel-based methods.",

                "value": "The authors propose a method that decreases reliance on irrelevant features by optimizing for conditional independence using conditional distance correlation for regression tasks. Through the Standard Anti-Causal Model (SAM) framework, the authors analyze and address pathways that could introduce bias, and encourage the model to focus solely on the direct relationship between input and target. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that DISCO matches or slightly outperforms two other bias-mitigation methods."

                "value": "This paper first proposes an anti-causal model to predict targets Y from input X considering possible causal, non-causal pathways. Theoretical result is derived using total variation to show that if the prediction model satisfies a conditional independence result given targets Y, its predictions will be unbiased from variables with undesired effects - Z,W due to spurious or irrelevant information. Further, the paper shows that the prediction model can be pushed in this direction through an additional regularization term during training. Distance correlation is used to this effect in deep learning models - using model features, data distractors and targets to formulate the regularization term. While some prior work also uses regularization for conditional independence, this method allows achieving competitive results to the baselines efficiently with lesser hyperparameters. This method extends beyond classification to continuous labels/vector."

They formalize a standard anticausal model (SAM) and prove that a predictor that satisfies a particular conditional independence relationship in this setting will be guaranteed to learn a stable prediction, invariant to spurious information. Although explicitly regularizing for this independence condition is challenging, especially in a black-box deep learning setting, they introduce a conditional  distance correlation based method -- which can be introduced as a simple regularization term -- to impose the desired conditional independence. While this regularization cannot be calculated in closed form estimator, they introduce a kernel regression method for estimating the quantity. The proposed regularization term is tested empirically on a set of 2d and 3d image tasks."

Firstly, the method is only tested on mostly simulation-based datasets, although there also exist many real-world datasets for spurious correlations. It would also be helpful for them to compare the method on some settings where there is a single, categorical spurious variable-- as there are extensive baseline methods in those settings (i.e. Sagawa et.al) . Currently, the method is compared to a relatively small number of baselines. Moreover, I may be missing something from my reading of the plots, but it seems that the gains of the method over the limited baselines that are tested are small and unlikely to be statistically significant. Maybe the authors could provide some additional statements explaining why simply being competitive with existing methods (I..e CIRCE) represents an important contribution. In particular, as the authors themselves acknowledge, DISCO is computationally more expensive which calls the contribution and relevance of the paper into question. I think the authors could better highlight under what settings they would expect DISCO to achieve significantly superior performance and ideally they could find some way to empirically shown this."
