    "title": "TILDE-Q: a Transformation Invariant Loss Function for Time-Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting has gained increasing attention in the field of artificial intelligence due to its potential to address real-world problems across various domains, including energy, weather, traffic, and economy. While time-series forecasting is a well-researched field, predicting complex temporal patterns such as sudden changes in sequential data still poses a challenge with current models. This difficulty stems from minimizing $L_p$ norm distances as loss functions, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean square error (MSE), which are susceptible to both intricate temporal dynamics modeling and signal shape capturing. Furthermore, these functions often cause models to behave aberrantly and generate uncorrelated results with the original time-series. Consequently, the development of a shape-aware loss function that goes beyond mere point-wise comparison is essential. In this paper, we examine the definition of shape and distortions, which are crucial for shape-awareness in time-series forecasting, and provide a design rationale for the shape-aware loss function. Based on our design rationale, we propose a novel, compact loss function called TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss function with Distance EQuilibrium) that considers not only amplitude and phase distortions but also allows models to capture the shape of time-series sequences. Furthermore, TILDE-Q supports the simultaneous modeling of periodic and nonperiodic temporal dynamics. We evaluate the efficacy of TILDE-Q by conducting extensive experiments under both periodic and nonperiodic conditions with various models ranging from naive to state-of-the-art. The experimental results show that the models trained with TILDE-Q surpass those trained with other metrics, such as MSE and DILATE, in various real-world applications, including electricity, traffic, illness, economics, weather, and electricity transformer temperature (ETT).",

                "value": "This paper introduces a novel loss function for time-series forecasting. Traditional loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are insufficient for complex temporal patterns and often fail to capture shape distortions in time-series data accurately. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss function with Distance Equilibrium), which is designed to be invariant to amplitude shifts, phase shifts, and uniform amplifications.\n\nThe main contributions of the paper include:\n\n1. A comprehensive exploration of shape awareness and distortion invariances in time-series data, enhancing understanding of their impact on forecasting accuracy.\n\n2. The design of TILDE-Q, a loss function that achieves shape-aware modeling by accommodating amplitude, phase, and amplification distortions.\n\n3. Empirical evaluations showing that models trained with TILDE-Q outperform those using standard metrics (e.g., MSE, DILATE) in various real-world applications, demonstrating higher forecasting accuracy and robustness across diverse domains like traffic, electricity, and weather forecasting.\n\nThis loss function is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring shape preservation in forecasts, providing more reliable and informative results by focusing on temporal dynamics rather than solely point-wise accuracy"

                "value": "Originality\n\nThe paper introduces a novel loss function, TILDE-Q (Transformation Invariant Loss function with Distance Equilibrium), which directly addresses a long-standing challenge in time-series forecasting: capturing shape distortions. This approach is innovative in two main ways:\n\n1. It expands beyond conventional Lp norm loss functions by targeting invariance to transformations such as amplitude shifting, phase shifting, and uniform amplification.\n\n2. TILDE-Q creatively combines Fourier coefficients and normalized cross-correlation in its loss function formulation, allowing models to learn temporal dynamics and shape in time-series data more effectively. This novel formulation is highly relevant, as shape-aware forecasting remains underexplored, with traditional metrics often failing in practical scenarios where pattern preservation is essential.\n\nQuality\n\nThe paper demonstrates technical depth, grounding the TILDE-Q loss function in rigorous theoretical justifications and thoroughly detailing the transformation invariances it aims to achieve. Additionally, the experiments are carefully conducted, testing the new loss function across multiple state-of-the-art forecasting models and a range of datasets (e.g., ECL, Electricity, Traffic). The authors have thoughtfully incorporated comparative analysis with other prominent loss functions, such as MSE and DILATE, and have shown measurable improvements in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Furthermore, the empirical results support TILDE-Q\u2019s robustness in both periodic and non-periodic settings, establishing the method\u2019s versatility and reliability across different temporal dynamics.\n\nClarity\n\nThe paper is well-organized and clearly written, making its technical contributions accessible without oversimplification. The mathematical formulations are precise, with key concepts like transformation invariance and shape-awareness explained in sufficient detail. Visual aids and examples (e.g., showing model outputs with different loss functions) help illustrate the paper's motivation and results effectively. The authors also contextualize their approach within prior literature, comparing TILDE-Q to existing methods and addressing the limitations of conventional loss functions (e.g., MSE\u2019s inability to capture temporal distortions).\n\nSignificance\n\nThe proposed TILDE-Q loss function offers substantial benefits to time-series forecasting, particularly in domains where shape preservation is crucial, such as traffic analysis, electricity usage, and economic forecasting. By improving models' ability to capture and retain shape characteristics, TILDE-Q offers significant potential for enhancing predictive accuracy and reliability in real-world applications. The work is especially relevant given the increasing demand for accurate forecasting in complex, non-stationary datasets where existing methods struggle. The approach is model-agnostic, broadening its applicability across various forecasting architectures, which adds further value to the broader AI and forecasting communities."

                "value": "1. Limited Theoretical Analysis of Loss Function Properties\n\nWhile TILDE-Q\u2019s design is explained in detail, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the properties and potential trade-offs of the loss function, particularly concerning convergence behavior and sensitivity to noise. For example:\n\nSensitivity Analysis: TILDE-Q is designed to be invariant to amplitude and phase shifts, but there is limited theoretical discussion on how these invariances impact convergence or stability during training, especially in noisy datasets. A formal exploration or proof of these characteristics would strengthen confidence in the loss function\u2019s robustness and may reveal cases where TILDE-Q could be fine-tuned.\n\nGeneralization Properties: Including a theoretical analysis of the loss function\u2019s generalization capabilities for complex time-series data could add value. For example, exploring how well TILDE-Q balances the trade-off between capturing shape and maintaining point-wise accuracy across different domains would support its broader applicability.\n\n2. Limited Comparisons with Alternative Loss Functions Beyond MSE and DILATE\n\nAlthough the experiments demonstrate TILDE-Q\u2019s effectiveness against MSE and DILATE, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with additional shape-aware loss functions or distance measures. Some alternatives worth considering include:\n\nCID (Complexity Invariant Distance) or CID-DTW: These metrics are known for handling shape similarity in time-series data. While TILDE-Q shows clear advantages over DILATE, CID-based methods are also shape-sensitive, so they could provide further insights into TILDE-Q\u2019s comparative strengths.\n\nMSM (Move-Split-Merge Distance): Another distance measure often used for shape-based comparisons in time-series forecasting. Incorporating MSM into experiments would offer a more comprehensive picture of TILDE-Q\u2019s relative advantages in modeling shape.\n\n3. Limited Analysis on Hyperparameter Sensitivity and Selection\n\nThe paper introduces hyperparameters \ud835\udefc and  \ud835\udefe in the TILDE-Q formulation, which weigh the importance of each distortion invariance. However, there is minimal guidance on how these should be chosen, and the paper does not explore the sensitivity of TILDE-Q to variations in these values:\n\nHyperparameter Sensitivity Study: Conducting a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis across various datasets and tasks would provide insight into how to best set or tune these values for optimal results.\n\nRecommendations for Specific Domains: Providing specific recommendations or heuristics for setting \ud835\udefc and  \ud835\udefe based on the dataset characteristics (e.g., high periodicity, non-stationary) would make the paper more practical for practitioners implementing TILDE-Q in different applications.\n\n4. Model-Agnostic Results Could Be Strengthened with Broader Model Comparisons\n\nThe paper tests TILDE-Q across several state-of-the-art models, but it focuses heavily on Transformer-based architectures. To strengthen claims of model-agnosticism, it would be helpful to test TILDE-Q on additional, fundamentally different models, such as:\n\nTraditional Statistical Models: Testing on models like ARIMA could illustrate how TILDE-Q performs in a more conventional setting, providing insights into whether TILDE-Q\u2019s shape-aware capabilities are beneficial even in non-deep learning contexts.\nRecurrent Models: While the paper includes some experiments with a GRU, additional recurrent models such as LSTM or BiLSTM could highlight whether TILDE-Q\u2019s shape-awareness is generally beneficial across sequential deep learning architectures.\n\n5. Limited Real-World Application Case Studies\n\nWhile the experiments include several datasets, the paper could further validate TILDE-Q\u2019s practical value by demonstrating its application in a real-world forecasting scenario where shape-preserving forecasts are crucial. Such a case study would:\n\nIllustrate Practical Relevance: Applying TILDE-Q in a specific domain with high stakes on shape preservation (e.g., predicting anomalies in sensor data for equipment monitoring) could make its benefits more concrete and relatable to practitioners. Long-Term Forecasting: Exploring a real-world scenario with longer forecast horizons and showing how TILDE-Q maintains shape fidelity over extended time frames could further highlight its advantages over traditional metrics."

                "value": "1. Theoretical Properties and Convergence of TILDE-Q Loss\n\nCould you provide more insights into the theoretical properties of TILDE-Q, particularly in terms of convergence and robustness to noise? Specifically, how does TILDE-Q\u2019s invariance to amplitude and phase shifts impact the stability of the training process? An explanation or analysis of these properties could clarify whether TILDE-Q may introduce any trade-offs or require certain conditions for effective convergence.\n\n2. Hyperparameter Selection and Sensitivity\n\nThe hyperparameters \ud835\udefc and  \ud835\udefe play a key role in balancing TILDE-Q\u2019s distortion invariances. Could you provide guidance on how these hyperparameters were chosen for the experiments and any best practices for tuning them? Additionally, it would be helpful to know if TILDE-Q\u2019s performance is sensitive to the values of these hyperparameters, as this may impact practical implementation across various datasets.\n\n3. Broader Comparison with Other Shape-Aware Metrics\n\nTILDE-Q is compared mainly against MSE and DILATE. Could you clarify why other shape-aware metrics, like CID-DTW or MSM, were not included? Such a comparison might offer additional context for understanding TILDE-Q\u2019s unique strengths. If computational constraints were a factor, do you have qualitative or preliminary findings on how TILDE-Q may perform relative to these methods?\nRelevance of Fourier Coefficients for Phase Shifting Invariance\n\nThe paper suggests Fourier coefficients to achieve phase shifting invariance. Could you elaborate on why Fourier coefficients are preferred over other potential methods for phase handling? Additionally, are there specific scenarios where this choice may limit TILDE-Q\u2019s effectiveness in capturing certain phase-shifted patterns?\n\n4. Applicability to Non-Deep Learning Models\n\nTILDE-Q is shown to work well with Transformer-based and GRU models. Do you foresee any challenges in applying TILDE-Q to more traditional forecasting models, such as ARIMA or SARIMA? This information could be useful for practitioners interested in testing TILDE-Q with non-deep learning approaches.\n\n5. Computational Complexity and Efficiency\n\nSince TILDE-Q combines several components (e.g., Fourier coefficients, softmax, cross-correlation), could you comment on its computational complexity compared to traditional loss functions like MSE? Additionally, are there potential optimizations or trade-offs that would make TILDE-Q more computationally feasible for large datasets or real-time applications?\nSuggestions for Improvement\n\n6. Include Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis\n\nAdding a sensitivity analysis for the hyperparameters \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefe would help readers understand TILDE-Q\u2019s robustness and provide guidance for practitioners applying it to new datasets.\n\n7. Explore Real-World Case Studies or Long-Term Forecasting Scenarios\n\nProviding a case study or a long-term forecasting scenario where shape preservation is crucial (e.g., equipment monitoring or anomaly detection) would highlight TILDE-Q\u2019s practical relevance and make its benefits more tangible.\n\n8. Clarify the Limitations or Conditions for Optimal Use\n\nWhile TILDE-Q shows impressive results, it would be helpful to outline any known limitations or conditions where TILDE-Q may be less effective. For instance, clarifying situations where high noise or extreme non-periodicity may reduce TILDE-Q\u2019s effectiveness could guide users on when to apply it and what adjustments may be necessary."

If k is the same for all time points, it may not always align with real-world scenarios where the deviation between predicted and true values varies over time. \n2. The idea of \"shape awareness invariant to amplitude shifting\" implies that the model will capture the overall shape or pattern regardless of vertical shifts. So, how this is achieved through a fixed gap k is unclear, as the shape might still be affected if the deviation varies.\n\n3. Equation 2 seems to be oversimplified. Having the same dominant frequency does not necessarily mean that the two time-series samples are similar enough. Two time-series with the same dominant frequency (as in your example; sin(x) and 2 sin(x+x0)) can still have substantial variations in amplitude, phase, and waveform shape.\n4. I also find that the claim \u201cEq. 2 allows a similar shape as the target time-series in forecasting, not exactly the same shape\u201d is vague. It doesn\u2019t clarify what level of similarity is acceptable, and it leaves open questions about how such similarity is quantified.\n\n5. How is constant \u201ck\u201d from Eq. 1 is still applied in Eq. 3?\n6. What if \\hat{y}_i in Eq. 3 is not 0?\n7. The authors claim that softmax produces relative values, hence it can handle any gap k. Softmax outputs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the sum of these values over all elements equals 1. My concern is that this normalization might not effectively capture a consistent gap across all values. \n8. How do the authors chose the values of \\alpha and \\beta in Eq. 8? Do we need to tune their values per dataset?\n9. For Figure 1, the blue boxes before the arrows are not clear what do they mean. What do the left and right subfigures mean?"
