    "title": "SynHING: Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation for Graph Learning and Explanation",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling graph structures across diverse domains, such as community analysis and recommendation systems. As the need for GNN interpretability grows, there is an increasing demand for robust baselines and comprehensive graph datasets, especially within the realm of Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). To address this, we introduce SynHING, a framework for Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation designed to advance graph learning and explanation.\nAfter identifying key motifs in a target HIN, SynHING systematically employs a bottom-up generation process with intra-cluster and inter-cluster merge modules. This process, along with post-pruning techniques, ensures that the synthetic HIN accurately mirrors the structural and statistical properties of the original graph. The effectiveness of SynHING is validated using four datasets - IMDB, Recipe, ACM, and DBLP - spanning three distinct application categories, demonstrating both its generality and practicality.\nFurthermore, SynHING provides ground-truth motifs for evaluating GNN explainer models, establishing a new benchmark for explainable, synthetic HIN generation. This contributes significantly to advancing interpretable machine learning in complex network environments.",

The author mentions in line 339 that \"the overall time complexity of SynHING is O(N),\" which seems efficient. However, the largest graph size used in the experiments is only 53,428, which is insufficient to demonstrate the scalability of the method.\n-\tThe purpose of SynHING is to generate HINs. To evaluate the effectiveness of SynHING, the author selects only three different HGNNs as baselines, which is insufficient to fully demonstrate the generalization capability of SynHING in generating HINs\u3002\n-\tEvaluating how similar the synthetic graphs are to real graphs is a meaningful experiment. The author addresses this question through pre-training and fine-tuning, which seems reasonable. However, the author only reports the results for HGT. Reporting results for more baselines, with consistent performance trends, would be necessary to support the experimental conclusions\u3002\n-\tThe presentation of the paper has some formatting inconsistencies that require a thorough review: (1) The caption of Figure 5 ends with a period, while other figures do not. Normally, if a caption is a complete sentence, it should end with a period. (2) Different formats are used when referencing figures, such as \"Fig. 3(a),\" \"Figure 4a,\" and \"Fig. 5a.\"."

The authors should provide a detailed introduction of when synthetic graphs need to approximate reference graphs and when they should differ from them. In my view, synthetic graphs should address some of the shortcomings of the reference graphs; otherwise, Section 5.4 lacks significance.\n3. I believe the authors need to conduct explainable experiments on the synthetic graphs to validate their effectiveness and to verify whether the ground truth is accurate. Potential models include: xPath[1] and HENCE-X[2].\n4. The proposed synthetic dataset seems targeted at node classification tasks; can it also be applied to graph classification tasks?\n\nReference:\n[1] Li, T., Deng, J., Shen, Y., Qiu, L., Yongxiang, H., & Cao, C.
