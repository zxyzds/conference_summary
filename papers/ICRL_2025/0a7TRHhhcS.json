    "abstract": "Traditional spatial-temporal models often overlook the complex decision-making processes and social factors that shape spatial-temporal event data generated by humans. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates choice theory with social intelligence to model and analyze counting processes, such as crime occurrences or bike-sharing activity, where the observed discrete events result from individual decisions influenced by social dynamics. \nOur approach aims to uncover latent human preference patterns, represented by utility functions, to capture the diverse decision-making factors within a population that result in the observed event counts. These latent factors help explain how choices\u2014such as where and when to commit a crime\u2014are shaped by personal preferences, environmental conditions, and social influences. By modeling the aggregate outcomes of these individual choices, we can better understand and predict patterns in counting processes. The proposed model adopts a preference-driven approach to counting data, providing interpretable insights at a detailed level. It also enables in-depth analysis of how external interventions, like law enforcement actions or policy changes, influence individual decisions and how these effects spread through the system. Empirical evaluation of crime and bike-sharing datasets demonstrates our model's ability to offer clear insights and achieve high predictive accuracy.",

                "value": "This paper presents a new spatial-temporal counting process model that integrates choice theory and social intelligence to capture human decision-driven event occurrences, such as crime rates and bike-sharing usage. The core idea is to use latent utility functions to represent diverse decision-making factors and to apply a mixture-of-experts model with a sparse gating function for adaptive selection. The model aims to reveal underlying patterns in counting processes, providing both predictive power and interpretability."

While the model performs well on mid-sized datasets, it is unclear if the sparse gating function and multiple experts could handle significantly larger spatial grids or finer temporal resolutions without substantial computational costs. A discussion on computational efficiency or optimization strategies, such as parallelization, would strengthen the model\u2019s applicability to broader scenarios."

Although the authors have considered three datasets, NYC Crime, Chicago Crime, and Shanghai Mobike, for evaluation, the scales of these datasets are quite limited. There are only less than 1000 events on the first two datasets, which makes us wonder whether the proposed method can be used in real-world applications where the dataset may be very huge.\n2. The technical contribution of the proposed method is questionable. The proposed method introduces a strategy of MoE, which is widely used in model ensembling and limits the contribution of the whole framework. In other words, it is very likely to improve performance by adding the MoE module. In short, the proposed solution is a bit straightforward.\n3. Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 require improvement. Observing some informative and insightful conclusions from these figures is very hard since the grids are coarse-grained."

Practical applications often involve large-scale datasets, and understanding the model's scalability and resource requirements is crucial. Without this information, it is challenging to determine the feasibility of deploying the model in real-world settings, which could limit its practical utility.\n3. **Future Research Directions**:\nThe paper does not clearly outline future research directions or potential extensions of the model.

First, although Fig. 1 visualizes the structure of the proposed model, most details explaining each part are not presented. For instance, what are the differences between spatial and position info? Which model does each expert use? Second, although the abstract and introduction state that social norms, environmental cues, and various other factors are considered, there is no corresponding formulation in Section 3. Finally, the experimental results do not validate these claims either. It is suggested to connect the claims with detailed descriptions in the methods and experiment sections.\n\nW2. Please include up-to-date related works in top journals [1][2][3]. Moreover, half of the comparative baselines in the experiment section were published more than 10 years ago, which may be too outdated for fair comparisons. It is suggested to compare with newer methods instead.\n[1] Weichao Liang, Zhiang Wu, Zhe Li, Yong Ge: CrimeTensor: Fine-Scale Crime Prediction via Tensor Learning with Spatiotemporal Consistency.

IEEE Trans. Big Data 9(5): 1392-1407 (2023)\n\nW3. The definitions of matrices A and B on line 227, page 5, and the purpose of formulating them are unclear. Specifically, what do the two matrices embed, respectively? Additionally, right before introducing these matrices, the model already includes positional, spatial, temporal, and feature embeddings. An alternative approach might be to directly feed these four embeddings to the experts, rather than combining them with the two matrices to avoid additional computational overhead. This raises questions about the necessity, purpose, and benefit of the intermediate matrix decomposition-based embedding method compared to a straightforward alternative.\n\nW4. Please clarify the \u201cranking\u201d concept in the gating function, starting from line 251 on page 5. Equations 7, 8, and the loss function at line 274 resemble a cross-entropy formulation, which is a classification-based metric rather than a ranking one. Additionally, I am uncertain whether ranking is appropriate in this scenario. Specifically, while predicting the time and place of a crime, a top-1 ranking for occurrence may not directly indicate that a crime is happening, as the probability could still be low. Therefore, relying on ranking rather than probability prediction may lead to false alarms and overreactions.\n\nW5. The practicality of the experimental setup is questionable. In the New York Crime and Chicago Crime datasets, each city is divided into 100 areas, and daytime is segmented into 4 time slots. However, it is unclear how large each area is after division. Is there evidence or a reference supporting that the 100-block granularity is beneficial for real-world law enforcement? Similarly, dividing daytime into four 6-hour slots may not be sufficiently granular. Is there a reference justifying this setup? Furthermore, it would be interesting to see the model\u2019s performance at finer granularities, with smaller areas and shorter time slots.\n\nW6. The experimental results may not fully examine the authors' claims. While modeling the \u201chuman decision process\u201d is a key focus, it is unclear how this is tested in the experiments. Are there specific sequential criminal events in the datasets? If so, does the proposed method successfully retrieve these sequences? How does the model demonstrate that its improvements are due to modeling the human decision process? Otherwise, if each crime is independent, how are the datasets suitable for examining causal relationships? In this context, could simple statistics identify criminal hotspots at specific time slots to yield similar results to those in Fig. 2? It is recommended to elaborate further on human decision modeling in the experiments."
