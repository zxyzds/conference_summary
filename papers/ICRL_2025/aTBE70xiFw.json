    "title": "Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising individual images, but there is a limit to the noise level they can handle.\nIn applications like cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the noise level is extremely high but datasets contain hundreds of thousands of projections of the same molecule, each taken a different viewing direction.\nExploiting this redundancy of information has proven useful in traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level.\nWe present a neural network architecture based on polar representation of images and transformers that simultaneously clusters, aligns, and denoises cryo-EM projection images.\nNumerical results show accurate denoising performance using this architecture, with a relative mean squared error of $0.06$ at signal-to-noise (SNR) level of $0.05$, outperforming traditional filter-based methods by a factor of $2\\times$.",

The proposed approach is based upon applying a CNN (to one image) or a transformer architecture (to many images) that is/are transformed into polar coordinates. The network architectures are specialized to have desirable invariances in the polar domains. The proposed method is tested on simulated data with varying amount of Poisson and Gaussian noise. The proposed method outperforms simple Weiner filtering."

However, it is my understanding that modern reconstruction techniques (e.g., expectation maximization [A]) marginalize over the various view directions and avoid denoising the 2D projections all together. \nThe manuscript mentions contamination detection as another possible use case for denoising, which may be valid. The manuscript needs to clarify which parts of the reconstruction pipeline it may and may not improve.\n\n[A] Scheres, Sjors HW. \"RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination.\" Journal of structural biology 180.3 (2012): 519-530.\n\n\n---Weak baselines: The proposed method outperforms Weiner filtering by a large margin. How does it compare to advanced non-learning-based methods like BM3D? How does it compare to a conventional CNN without a polar transformation?\n\n---Missing ablations: There is no evidence any of the proposed network choices are useful. How does the proposed method compare to a single U-net applied to cartesian coordinates?

If we consider the denoising model H_theta as an inverse of a statistical noise distribution, would \"H_theta(R_alpha(x)) = R_alpha(H_theta(x))\"? If so, how does the polar representation improve accuracy? If not, could you explain the key difference?\n\n4. In Section 5.2, I think \"f_key\" and \"f_query\" are symmetric. That is, using \"m - l\" in either should work. So, why is f_key chosen over f_query? I also wonder if adding both query and key with the same value, but with output as \"S_l = (sqrt(2) / 2 * S_l_key) * (sqrt(2) / 2 * S_l_query)\" would yield more accurate results, since it allows the model more freedom to learn more features.\n\n5.

These _polar CNNs_ then serve as the key and query networks in a transformer to obtain a rotation-equivariant attention mechanism between images that should allow for solution of the full set denoising task, i.e. the implicit clustering of images by viewing angle for an improved denoising performance."

I suggest to include a comparison to at least one of the deep-learning based methods, such as the DnCNN (Zhang et al., 2017) or a U-Net denoiser adapted for cryoEM data.\n\nFurther, all experiments are conducted on simulated data. It therefore remains unclear whether the method would generalize to real data acquisitions as well. Do the authors envision the method to be trained on simulated data and then be applied to real data? In particular, the training and evaluation both use sets of images that only contain two viewing angles. How can this be achieved for real data? This apparent limitation is not discussed. I suggest the authors either 1) include experiments where they apply their method to real data or 2) discuss challenges they foresee in the application to real data, including possible domain shift and a random sampling of viewing angles.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper could be strengthened significantly by an extended set of experiments that show this theoretically-compelling method to work well in practice and a discussion of its real-world limitations. Specifically, I suggest the authors include a deep-learning based method as an additional baseline to make their evaluation more comprehensive and demonstrate or discuss the applicability of their method to real data. If application to real data is currently not feasible, I suggest to include a discussion of those limitations and an outline for future work for how those limitations could potentially be overcome."

                "value": "This paper deals with the denoising of images produced in the context of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis. In cryo-EM single-particle analysis, an electron microscope records 2D projections of the unknown 3D structure of a single type of particle (e.g., a specific protein) at random orientations. These projections can then be used to estimate a 3D model of the particle. Due to data acquisition limitations, the 2D particle projections have very low signal-to-noise ratios, requiring denoising.\n\nThe authors propose two novel deep learning architectures to improve the denoising of 2D particle projections: \n- The Polar CNN and the polar transformer. The polar CNN is designed to be equivariant to 2D rotations. The authors argue that this property is desirable because the 2D particle projections capture the particle at random orientations.\n\n- The polar transformer is based on the polar CNN and additionally exploits redundancy in the data by combining information from projection images that show the particle from a similar direction. \n\nThe authors test their new architectures on synthetic data and compare them to denoising with a Wiener filter.\n\n**Recommendation:** I do not recommend the paper for publication at ICLR. In my opinion, the weaknesses in the experiments outweigh the reasons to accept the paper (see \"Weaknesses\" for more details). However, I would like to emphasize that the paper has potential and I am willing to change my evaluation if all my concerns regarding the experiments are sufficiently addressed."

Good candidates for deep learning based baselines could be, e.g., CryoCARE [1] and Topaz [2].\n\n\t- There is no experiment that compares the denoising performance of a standard 2D convolutional network with that of a polar CNN and a polar transformer.\n\t\tTherefore, it is unclear how much denoising actually benefits from the equivariance properties of the polar CNN and the polar transformer. \n\n\t- The authors train their polar CNN and their polar transformer in a supervised manner. In my opinion, this setup is not realistic, since pairs of noisy images and clean underlying ground truth are typically not readily available in cryo-EM single-particle analysis (see also \"Questions\").\n\t\tPerhaps it would be possible for the authors to consider self-supervised training without clean ground truth for their experiments. (This has already been done for methods such as CryoCARE and Topaz).\n\n\t- All experiments are on synthetic data. There are no experiments on real images produced with cryo-EM. This recent dataset proposed by Dhakal et al. [3] contains real cryo-EM images with picked particles. Maybe this data can be used for further evaluation. \n\n\n- Section 5.2 on angular attention, which is one of the central contributions of the paper, is unclear to me. There is no explicit definition of the angular attention layer $f_\\theta^{\\text{ang-attention}}$. I have formulated some questions about angular attention in the \"Questions\" section.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- It is unclear to me which parts of the polar CNN and polar transformer architectures are novel and which are from existing work. Perhaps the authors could make this clearer in the paper.\n- This is more of a suggestion: Figures illustrating angular convolution and angular attention mechanisms might make these concepts a bit easier for readers to grasp.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n[1] Buchholz, Tim-Oliver, et al. \"Cryo-CARE: Content-aware image restoration for cryo-transmission electron microscopy data.\" 2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019).
