    "title": "Fed-REACT: Federated Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Time Series Data",
    "abstract": "Motivated by high resource costs and privacy concerns that characterize centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) emerged as an efficient alternative that allows the participating clients to collaboratively train global model while keeping their data local.\nIn practice, distributions of clients' data vary over time and from one client to another, creating heterogeneous conditions that deteriorate performance of conventional FL algorithms. In this work, we study an FL framework where clients train on heterogeneous time series data and introduce to these settings Fed-REACT, a novel federated learning method leveraging representation learning and evolutionary clustering. The algorithm consists of two stages: (1) in the first stage, the clients learn a model that extracts meaningful features from local time series data; (2) in the second stage, the server adaptively groups clients into clusters and coordinated cluster-wise learning of task (i.e., post-representation) models for local downstream tasks, e.g., classification or regression. We demonstrated high accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in experiments on real-world time series datasets, and provided theoretical analysis of its performance.",

                "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback. Please see our responses below:\n\nWeakness 1.1: Contrastive Loss Definition \u2014 The contrastive loss defined in (1) is used to develop Phase 1 of the Fed-REACT algorithm and is applied in our experiments. In the theoretical analysis (Section 3), we use a simplified version of the contrastive loss (1), focusing on positive pairs to make the analysis more tractable, as done in previous representation learning literature (e.g., $\\textit{Does learning from decentralized non-iid unlabeled data benefit from self-supervision?}$). This purpose of the analysis is to provide theoretical insights into time-series representation learning in a federated learning setting.\n\nWeakness 1.2: Notation Consistency \u2014 Notations vary throughout the manuscript for clarity: $\\theta$ represents the feature extractor model parameters, while $\\theta_{task}$ represents task model parameters. In Phase 2, $W_t$, $\\psi_t$, and $N_t$ are used for evolutionary clustering in task model updates. Here, $W_t$ denotes the similarity matrix of task model parameters, with each element representing the cosine similarity of parameters from two clients, as specified in lines 177\u2013178.\n\nWeakness 2: Purpose of Section 3 \u2014 This work addresses federated learning on heterogeneous time-series data, leveraging self-supervised learning to capture meaningful temporal features. Section 3 aims to offer theoretical insights into federated self-supervised learning on time-series data. Specifically, we analyze a time-varying local objective function, $f_{t, i}$, and adopt time-smoothed gradient descent for time-series settings. We show that the regret converges to a small error, supporting the feasibility of federated self-supervised learning on time-series data.\n\nWeakness 3: Performance with Large Client Numbers \u2014 For scenarios with 100 clients, in Figure 3, the Fed-REACT algorithm achieves the highest Rand Score = 1 within just three communication rounds, converging to the true clustering membership. In contrast, baseline methods fail to identify the true clusters, with Rand Scores fluctuating with average below 0.8. Additionally, Table 3 shows that baseline methods (IFCA and FLSC) fall short of Fed-REACT across one or multiple distribution parameter values, $\\beta$, demonstrating Fed-REACT\u2019s efficacy in federated self-supervised learning on heterogeneous time-series data. The Phase 2 design in Fed-REACT further improves accuracy, achieving consistent results across all $\\beta$ values.\n\nWeakness 4: Limited Novelty \u2014 To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address the novel problem of federated self-supervised learning on heterogeneous time-series data. For this problem, we specifically propose Fed-REACT that contains the federated self-supervised learning phase and the task model learning phase. The federated self-supervised learning framework has not been explored in heterogeneous time series data. The evolutionary clustering, has not been explored in the federated learning setting, either, since most work does not consider the clients\u2019 models evolve over time. Phase 2\u2019s adaptive forgetting factor further enhances evolutionary clustering, distinguishing Fed-REACT from simple combinations of existing methods.\n\nWeakness 5: Specification to Time-Series Data \u2014 Does $\\textit{any type of data}$ refer to static data? Time-series data, with its temporal dimension, is a generalization of static data and requires specific consideration. Most FL algorithms focus on static data and do not extend naturally to time-series data. Fed-REACT is specifically designed for time-series data and can also handle static data as a special case by excluding the temporal dimension.\n\nQuestion 1: Specification to Time-Series Data \u2014 Fed-REACT is tailored for federated learning on heterogeneous time-series data, with four unique aspects:\n\n1.\tPhase 1 leverages contrastive learning, with positive/negative pairs selected within time-series trajectories.\n\n2.\tPhase 2 applies evolutionary clustering and adaptive forgetting, both critical for evolving local models in time-series contexts.\n\n3.\tClients collect streaming time-series data for input into local models, resulting in a time-varying objective function.\n\n4.\tThe optimization adopts time-smoothed gradient descent to address the time-varying objective function.\n\nThank you for the thoughtful feedback. We hope these responses clarify our approach and contributions."

For example, (1) introduces the contrastive loss that would be used in the first phase of feature extraction. However, the theoretical analysis does not make any reference to (1); instead it introduces an other objective function, $f_{\\text{SSL}}$. An other example of inconsistent notation, is the introduction of $\\phi_t$, $W_t$, and $N_t$, which are not explicitly connected to the parameter  of the problem $\\theta$ and $\\theta_{\\text{task}}$. \n* I do not really see how Section 3 fits in the paper and how it serves its goal. This section proves the convergence of federated projected gradient descent under a restrictive set of assumptions to a neighborhood of a stationary point. \n* The numerical simulations show the advantage of the proposed method when the number of clients is small, but the advantage of this method is small when the number of clients is relatively large (>50).\n* The paper is principally proposing to learn a feature extractor in a federated self-supervised fashion. Afterwards, evolutionary clustering is used to learn one model by cluster. Both these techniques are already known, therefore the novelty of the paper is limited.\n* The proposed approach is claimed to be tailored for time series, but it could be used for any type of data."
