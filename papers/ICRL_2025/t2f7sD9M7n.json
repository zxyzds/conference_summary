    "title": "Learning the Hamiltonian of Disordered Materials with Equivariant Graph Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning the ground-state electronic properties of molecules and crystalline materials, subverting computationally intensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Materials with structural disorder, however, are more challenging to learn as they exhibit higher complexity and a more extensive palette of local atomic environments, all of which require large (10+ Angstrom) cells to be accurately captured. In this work, we adapt efficient equivariant GNN approaches to learn disordered materials' electronic properties, represented by the Hamiltonian matrix ($\\mathbf{H}$). Since creating a large graph corresponding to the whole structure of interest would be computationally prohibitive, we introduce an 'augmented partitioning' approach in which the graph is sliced into multiple partitions, each augmented with masked virtual nodes and edges. This method maintains correct atomic neighborhoods within a single message passing layer, allowing for the network to learn the electronic properties of amorphous HfO$_2$ materials with 3,000 nodes (atoms), 500,000+ edges, and $\\sim$28 million orbital interactions (non-zero entries of $\\mathbf{H}$).",

I suggest the authors apply their proposed graph partitioning methods to other materials-related challenges beyond the scope of this paper. For example, exploring applications in molecular modeling, crystalline structures, or other materials science problems would significantly broaden the impact of the work. This could be complemented by additional practical evaluations, such as comparing the method\u2019s performance on various datasets or against other state-of-the-art approaches. Including metrics such as computational efficiency and accuracy in these broader contexts would provide a stronger empirical basis for the proposed method. \n\n- I think this paper is not theoretically solid enough to meet the standards expected at this conference. The contributions are modest and mainly focused on a graph partitioning approach, which lacks a strong theoretical foundation. To enhance the work, I recommend the authors further develop the theoretical framework, particularly by providing more rigorous analysis or proofs regarding the scalability or performance guarantees of their approach."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper has several fundamental methodological issues. The most critical concern is that the proposed partitioning scheme breaks the hierarchical nature of Message Passing Neural Networks. While standard MPNNs use multiple MP layers to incrementally increase the receptive field, this method's single-layer virtual node approach artificially truncates information flow at partition boundaries, compromising the network's ability to capture long-range interactions. The authors attempt to justify this limitation by invoking the \"near-sightedness\" of the Hamiltonian, but provide no rigorous analysis of how Hamiltonian matrix elements Hij are affected by distant atoms or how the neglected higher-order interactions might impact accuracy. The validation is severely limited, with only three structures of a perfect stoichiometric HfO2 being tested. In real materials applications, amorphous HfO2 often contains various defects such as oxygen vacancies and the Hf:O ratio can deviate from the ideal 1:2 stoichiometry. The absence of these realistic material features in the training data raises serious concerns about the method's practical utility. Without testing on structures with different stoichiometries, defects, and degrees of disorder, it's impossible to assess whether this approach can truly address real computational challenges in materials science."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1.  Standard Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are designed to capture hierarchical structural information through multiple layers, where each additional MP layer extends the receptive field and allows nodes to aggregate information from more distant neighbors. The partitioning scheme presented in this paper fundamentally breaks this mechanism by using only single-layer MP with virtual nodes at boundaries. The authors shoule provided more  justification for using single-layer MP.  they should provide quantitative analysis demonstrating how Hamiltonian matrix elements Hij are affected by atoms at different distances, and how this relates to their architectural choices? This should include comparison with full multi-layer MP on smaller systems.\n\n2. The work emphasizes parallel training through system partitioning to handle large disordered systems. However, if the locality of the Hamiltonian truly holds as claimed, then a model trained on small cells should be able to generalize to larger disordered systems, as the local atomic environments would be similar. In this case, standard GNN approaches without partitioning would remain valid.  The authors should provided quantitative comparison between their method  and a standard GNN model trained on small cells and directly applied to large systems .\n\n3. The paper only presents the validation with perfect stoichiometric HfO$_2$ structures, which is far from realistic material conditions. Could the authors demonstrate how their method performs on structures wit Hf or O vacancies, varying Hf:O ratio.\n\n4. The reported accuracy of 5.87 meV is significantly higher than the sub-meV accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art models in electronicHamiltonian prediction. The authors should either justify why this level of accuracy is sufficient, or provide direct comparisons with other methods (e.g., DeepH, HamGNN, etc.) on benchmark systems on small systems. If the accuracy loss is a trade-off for handling larger systems, this limitation should be explicitly discussed and quantified."
