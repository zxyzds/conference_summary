    "title": "From Steering Vectors to Conceptors and Beyond: Compositional Affine Steering Mechanisms for LLMs",
    "abstract": "Controlling and understanding the representations of large language models (LLMs) remain central challenges as they become more powerful. In this paper, we combine conceptor theory with recent advances in activation steering to develop a novel framework that generalizes both approaches for provably optimal affine steering. Conceptors characterize sets of neural network activations, representable as ellipsoids, and they act as soft projection matrices, enabling precise and flexible control over LLM activations while offering deeper insights into their internal representations. Our framework derives optimal affine steering functions from first principles, outperforming traditional additive steering methods across in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we use a Boolean algebra over conceptor matrices that allows for the composition of multiple steering objectives. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach surpasses existing methods for combining steering vectors. By uniting conceptor theory with activation steering, this work provides not only a more powerful tool for controlling LLM outputs, but also a principled approach for better understanding the internal mechanisms governing model representations and behavior.",

I would like to understand the difference so I can better understand the proposed method in this paper. Furthermore, I was a bit confused what does a better steering method mean. By looking at plot 2 and 3, can we say that a steering method is better if it can better extract features to represent the task?\n\n---\nOverall by looking at the experiment result it seems this paper proposes a method that extracts task features more effectively but the paper lacks clarity on how this method works."

                "value": "Originality: Good. The method being proposed is novel and differs substantially from other works within the space of steering interventions. \n\nQuality: Fair. While the principles seem sound, I have some concerns as to the validity of the experimental results, as well as the authors' claims. More details are provided in 'Weaknesses' below. \n\nClarity: Fair. The bulk of the paper focuses on building up to deriving the optimal linear and affine steering functions (Propositions 1,2). I found this derivation hard to follow as the derivation introduced many distinct terms (Definitions 1-4, 8-9) which were difficult to keep track of mentally. Furthermore, relatively little mental scaffolding was included to help the reader build intuition about the meaning of the intermediate steps. I would have preferred if the derivation had been summarised and / or moved to the Appendix, with the main paper simply stating the optimal affine steering intervention (Proposition 2) and focusing on building intuition for the reader. This would also have cleared up more space for results. \n\nSignificance: Fair, assuming the results and claims in the paper are correct. The paper provides a sign of life that conceptors can outperform simpler steering approaches. However, this method is also more difficult to apply, requiring an additional hyperparameter search, which may not be justified by the relative improvement over simpler, hyperparameter-free baselines. From an interpretability perspective, there is a lack of a central take-away insight from the paper. As a point of reference, the original function vectors paper (Todd et al, 2024) yields the insight that 'language models represent concepts as vectors' in activation space. The conceptor-based approach does not yield a similarly crisp insight into the geometry of language models' representation space. From an empirical alignment perspective, the results are relatively shallow (only 1 main set of experiments). Furthermore, the tasks considered are toy-ish and do not reflect realistic use cases for language model alignment. Overall, the paper is of limited significance to the broader alignment field."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The advantage of conceptors over baselines seems somewhat incremental. In Table 1, for 2 out of 5 tasks (capitalize and present-past), conceptors did not meaningfully outperform the addition baselines. On the remaining 3 out of 5 tasks, a substantial fraction of the improvement can be attributed to mean-centering (compare Addition-MC with Addition). Furthermore, while the paper seems to propose affine conceptors as the most general method, the benefit over linear conceptors was negligible. \n\nI am concerned that the demonstrated advantage of conceptors could be partially due to hyperparameter optimization. Conceptor-based steering introduces an additional 'aperture' parameter which is optimised on a per-dataset basis, whereas the baseline of steering vectors does not require such a parameter. In order to do a fair comparison, I think the authors should restrict themselves to a single global choice of aperture parameter across the 6 tasks. It would also be important to include a discussion on the effect of non-optimal choices of the aperture parameter. \n\nThe paper claims to unify affine steering functions (Singh et al, 2024) and additive steering functions (Turner et al, 2023). However, the experiments section only includes comparisons to the latter. Given the scope of the authors' claims, it seems important to also have the comparisons to the former. \n\nLittle analysis and discussion is provided to allow the reader to understand why conceptors improve over baselines. I think the paper would be much more exciting if it could state the specific assumptions on representational geometry that conceptors target (similar to how steering vectors target linear geometry), and then demonstrate that this geometrical structure is present in language models. See [1] for a reference work where I think this is achieved. \n\nAs stated above, the methods section is difficult to follow and could probably be shortened. \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658"

In particular, I\u2019m not sure why we want the steering function C to satisfy H_c \\approx CH_c, which is what the first term is incentivising, and I\u2019m also not sure why we want C to have small norm, which is what the second term is incentivising.\n\nIn Figure 1, the conceptor steering operation is illustrated as 'projecting' all activations to within an ellipsoid space.

The paper presents formal and theoretical results describing conceptors and proving how to calculate the optimal affine transformation for a given concept, occasionally seeing links between this work and prior methods for activation steering. The paper then presents empirical results on 5 function steering tasks from previous work, where their method outperforms the baselines across all layers of both models.

                "value": "# Paper being self-contained\n\nWhile the paper is mostly self-contained, it references Jaeger's (2014) work on conceptors frequently. The main places where this makes the motivation and contribution less clear is in the definition from Jaeger of optimal connectors. It is not clear to me why this definition is the correct notion of optimality, and so justifying this more would be beneficial to the clarity of the paper.\n\n# Minimal experiments\n\nWhile the paper compares against several baselines, it only shows results on 5 tasks, which is quite a small set. It would be beneficial to expand the experiments in the paper in several ways:\n* More and different tasks. These could be additional function vector tasks, but also the persona tasks as in https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681, https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12404, or other more generative style-based tasks from previous work. This would demonstrate the benefits of this method more generally across a wider range of settings, and be much more compelling\n* Measuring general performance degradation. As shown in recent work (https://www.anthropic.com/research/evaluating-feature-steering), activation steering methods can sometimes decrease general performance while increasing task-specific performance. As the conceptor method applies a more substantial transformation than additive steering, it would be beneficial to ensure this transformation doesn\u2019t degrade general model performance more than activation steering. This could be done on generative tasks as in previous and concurrent work (https://www.anthropic.com/research/evaluating-feature-steering, https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681)\n\n# Summary\n\nOverall, I'm giving this paper a 6, as I believe the contributions of conceptors applying to activation steering and experiments are sufficiently meaningful as a contribution. To raise my score higher, I would want to see more additional experiments as described above. If experiments were done in a range of domains and results were still positive, I think this would be a very strong paper."
