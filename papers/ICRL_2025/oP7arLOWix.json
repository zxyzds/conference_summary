    "abstract": "Conformal prediction has been a popular distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification. In this work, we present a novel conformal prediction method for time-series, which we call Kernel-based Optimally Weighted Conformal Prediction Intervals ($\\texttt{KOWCPI}$). Specifically, $\\texttt{KOWCPI}$ adapts the classic Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson (RNW) estimator for quantile regression on dependent data and learns optimal data-adaptive weights. Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of $\\texttt{KOWCPI}$ on real time-series against state-of-the-art methods, where $\\texttt{KOWCPI}$ achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.",

                "value": "The authors introduce KOWCPI to address the difficulties that arise from employing conformal prediction in the time series setting. In order for standard conformal prediction procedures to have valid statistical coverage guarantees the data needs to be exchangeable. However, this requirement is violated in time series data. KOWCPI uses the Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson estimator for quantile regression in the presence of dependent data to learn the distribution of residuals. Using this information, intervals can be constructed that have been theoretically shown to provide conditional coverage and empirically have been found to be narrower than other baselines while maintaining desired coverage."

In this case, when the data is limited, kernel estimates may not yield reliable results. Also, large $w$ leads to a low convergence rate of coverage. So it is better to include experimental results showing how coverage and interval width as $w$ increases for different sample sizes and datasets with varying degrees of temporal dependence.\n\n-  The method establishes prediction intervals for stationary time series.

While the paper discusses the settings for these parameters, it is unclear whether the experimental results are sensitive to them. Additional experimental results may be needed to clarify this.\n\n- When the dimension of $\\tilde{X}$ is large, the results from kernel estimation may not be robust.

For example, providing a brief summary of the key differences between KOWCPI and each baseline method, highlighting why these differences might lead to improved performance may be helpful.  You can also include a table to compare the main features of each method if possible.\n- Besides, the comparison methods in experiments seem to be incomplete. For example, the conformal PID in [1], the BCI in [2] and the decay-OGD in [3] should be considered. \n\n4. Optimal choice of window length $\\omega$: \n - Is it possible to design some strategy to determine optimal $\\omega$ values that adapt to real-time changes in data volatility or distribution patterns, thereby further enhancing the KOWCPI? For example, using change point detection algorithms or online learning techniques to dynamically adjust the window length.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Angelopoulos A, Candes E, Tibshirani R J.

Differentiation from SPCI.**\n\nOne concern I have is that this approach feels very similar to SPCI both in terms of algorithm (using an estimator to model residuals) and guarantee / proof technique (relies on the convergence property of the estimator). In terms of experiment results, KOWCPI also does not significantly outperform SPCI (in figure 2(c), there is a significant chunk of time where SPCI is more valid). \n\nCan you add some more explanation on how your method is different from SPCI, in terms of theoretical guarantees, assumptions on data, and performance? It will not only improve clarity, but also help readers in practice know which method to choose for their specific applications. \n\n**2. Experiment results & analysis**\n\nI would strongly encourage the authors to add more details to their experiment results, including: \n\n- Add standard deviations to table 1. \n- Explain the results in table 1. What are the rationale of highlighting the first row? You should also highlight other methods that achieve the same coverage, and explain  why lower width was not highlighted. \n- Add experiments for one or more values of $\\alpha$ to demonstrate consistent performance.\n- Provide some qualitative examples to show why/how the KOWCPI confidence bands are better. \n- Elaborate on figure 2(d), perhaps adding a further study/analysis on weights.
