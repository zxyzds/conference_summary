    "title": "RoundTable: Investigating Group Decision-Making Mechanism in Multi-Agent Collaboration",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the efficacy of Multi-Agent Systems in eliciting cross-agent communication and enhancing collective intelligence through group decision-making in a decentralized setting. Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments.",

                "value": "The authors studies multi-agent collaboration in group decision-making. They investigate the impact of various social choice methods (voting mechanisms) on group decision making. The collaborative platform is evaluated under two environments: simulated exchange economy and a complex recommendation systems both with different metrics to evaluate the performance. Experiments reveal the impact of different social choice methods on the MAS performance. Linguistic features of agent conversations are indicative of effective collaboration that provide useful information for terminating the conversation. The paper provides insights in designing MAS environments using LLMs which can outperform a single agent LLM that is known to have unstable predictions."

The figures and tables, like those illustrating performance differences across social choice mechanisms, provide visual clarity that aids understanding.\n\n- The authors employ rigorous evaluation metrics (utility, fairness, and efficiency) and analyze cross-agent conversation features to support their conclusions. These metrics give robustness to the study's claims about the advantages of decentralized collaboration and social choice methods."

Although these are relevant, real-world MAS applications may present further challenges not fully addressed by the study\u2019s current models and assumptions.\n-  The paper explores early stopping methods to enhance MAS efficiency, but this approach may not translate as effectively in highly dynamic environments where task complexity varies. More varied scenarios could strengthen the analysis of when and how stopping criteria should adjust to different environments.\n\n- Dependence on LLM-based Agents: The research relies on Large Language Models (LLMs) for MAS agent communication, which may limit the study\u2019s applicability to non-LLM-based MAS systems. This reliance could restrict the generalizability of findings across different types of MAS, especially where language-based communication is less prominent.

While simulations offer a controlled context ideal for variable isolation, they often fall short in capturing the intricacies and unpredictability inherent in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)\u3002\n2. The paper introduces an intriguing concept of early stopping methods grounded in the linguistic nuances of agent communication. However, the evaluation of these methods is confined to the specific scenarios outlined in the study, without extensive validation across a broader spectrum of decision-making contexts or diverse agent configurations. This limitation hampers the ability to ascertain the broader efficacy of the early stopping methods in different MAS environments or amidst varied communication dynamics.\n3. Although the paper delves into multiple voting mechanisms and scrutinizes their efficacy in multi-agent collaboration, it does not offer a thorough comparison with current state-of-the-art approaches in decentralized decision-making .  The omission of such comparisons restricts the capacity to appraise how the proposed methods measure up against the most effective techniques in the domain."

Lack of Novelty in Decision-Making Mechanisms: The core contribution of the paper revolves around applying well-established social choice mechanisms (e.g., Majority Voting, Ranked Voting, Cumulative Voting) to decentralized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, these voting methods have been extensively studied in both social choice theory and multi-agent systems, which limits the paper\u2019s originality.\n\n2. Limited Theoretical Foundation for Early Stopping Methods: The proposed early stopping methods for agent collaboration, based on linguistic cues and information difference, are interesting but lack rigorous theoretical justification. The idea of using dialogue act transitions and message embedding distances to halt collaboration is novel, but the connection between these metrics and optimal decision-making outcomes is not well substantiated.\n\n3. Scalability and Complexity Issues Not Addressed: The paper does not address key challenges related to the scalability of the RoundTable platform. For example, it is unclear how the proposed platform would handle the computational complexity of aggregating agent votes or resolving conflicts in environments with hundreds of agents. Additionally, while decentralized systems are inherently more scalable than centralized ones, the paper does not explore the trade-offs between decision quality and computational efficiency in larger systems. \n\n4. Other issues:  1)The paper seems to suggest that the group utility is maximized when agents' preferences are aggregated, but the mechanism for achieving this is unclear. 2)How exactly does the context C_i  influence the proposals made by agents? Is the function f_p\n  deterministic, or does it incorporate stochastic elements based on agent behavior? Moreover, there is no clear explanation of how the proposals are adjusted or optimized over multiple rounds of collaboration."
