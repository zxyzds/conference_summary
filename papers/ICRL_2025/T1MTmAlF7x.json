    "title": "EDM2+: Exploring Efficient Diffusion Model Architectures for Visual Generation",
    "abstract": "The training and sampling of diffusion models have been exhaustively elucidated in prior art. Instead, the underlying network architecture design remains on a shaky empirical footing. Furthermore, in accordance with the recent trend of scaling law, large-scale models make inroads into generative vision tasks. However, running such large diffusion models incurs a sizeable computational burden, rendering it desiderata to optimize calculations and efficiently allocate resources. To bridge these gaps, we navigate the design landscape of efficient U-Net based diffusion models, stemming from the prestigious EDM2. Our exploration route is organized along two key axes, layer placement and module interconnection. We systematically study fundamental design choices and uncover several intriguing insights for superior efficacy and efficiency. These findings culminate in our redesigned architecture, EDM2+, that reduces the computational complexity of the baseline EDM2 by $2\\times$ without compromising the generation quality. Extensive experiments and comparative analyses highlight the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, which achieves the state-of-the-art FID on the hallmark ImageNet benchmark. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

                "value": "This paper presents EDM2+, an exploration of efficient U-Net based diffusion model architectures that builds upon EDM2. While prior work has extensively studied training and sampling of diffusion models, the underlying network architecture design remains underexplored. The authors investigate the design landscape along two key axes - layer placement and module interconnection - leading to several critical insights for superior efficiency. Through systematic analysis and ablation studies, they develop EDM2+, which reduces the computational complexity of EDM2 by 2\u00d7 without compromising generation quality.\nThe authors' main contributions include: (1) conducting comprehensive experiments to identify EDM2's architectural limitations, (2) conceptualizing performance-optimized solutions for both generation quality and efficiency, and (3) developing an architecture that excels other leading diffusion models and GANs on the ImageNet benchmark. When equipped with autoguidance, EDM2+ sets new record FID scores on ImageNet 64\u00d764 using deterministic sampling, offering a new standard in the field of generative modeling."
